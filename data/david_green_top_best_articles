The 20 best HR Analytics articles of 2014,The 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics,2. Patrick Coolen,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=vsrp_people_res_infl_post_title,"[<p>Is HR lost without analytics? And with analytics I do not mean reporting on FTE, headcount, employee engagement or for instance providing the number of talents in your organisation. With analytics I mean applying statistical methods, like regression analyses, on data sets that combine HR and business data. The latter allows you to really determine the impact of HR elements such as, engagement on for instance client satisfaction, products sold or market share. Exactly this type of analytics will (re-)claim that strategic seat at the business table HR is talking about for the last ten years. So not surprisingly, the mission of my department is to make HR more fact based and to inject decision making with sophisticated data analytics. To achieve this we have been focusing for the last year and a half on HR analytics and strategic workforce planning. And we are pleased with the progress and the appetite for our services within our organisation. In this article I am happy to share our lessons learned in the field of HR analytics.</p>, <p>I hope this article gave you some useful insights. You can read more on HR analytics and strategic workforce planning in my Flip Board magazine. Please visit via linkedin or my twitter page. And now it is up to you to start with HR analytics.

The 20 best HR Analytics articles of 2014,5 Types of HR Analytics Vendors,4. Andrew Marritt,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141112084226-78008-the-5-types-of-hr-analytics-vendors?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>In my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141106200000-78008-adp-data-aggregation-done-well"" target=""_blank"">last post</a> I mentioned ADP as part of a group we call the Data Aggregators. Since that article several people have asked what the other vendor categories that we see in the HR Analytics market.</p>, <p>Running a firm in this space I feel it important to be able to define our broader market to help stakeholders understand where we fit in. I think it’s a useful framework for understanding how the market is developing.</p>, <p>Firms will often fall into multiple categories but have a dominant approach which drives their business models. Business models are important, even if you’re a client because it can make explicit what firms are selling and ultimately what is the product.</p>, <p>The question also is ‘what is HR analytics?’ We have to set the boundaries somewhere. For this classification I’m counting firms in if their creating tools that repurpose multiple data sources, especially a firms’ own data, in a way to enable better decision making. Doing so excludes two groups:</p>, <p>So, without further ado, here is the OrganizationView HR analytics market classification:</p>, <p><strong>The Technologists</strong></p>, <p>The Technologists take an IT-centric approach to analytics, with a revenue model that is heavily based on software licences and implementation services. In today’s market software is likely to be cloud-based.</p>, <p>A Technologists’ approach is likely to be successful if you are convinced that your requirements for analytics are predictable and stable. Alternatively they may be useful to cover the basics in a hybrid or combinational model.</p>, <p><strong>The Data Aggregators</strong></p>, <p>There are several firms who’s strength, and to some degree value, is from their large stores of cross-firm workforce data, usually at the level of an individual employee. These firms are now creating new business lines through the aggregation and analysis of this data.</p>, <p>During the last few years several large acquisitions have been linked to this approach. These would include CEB’s $660m acquisition of SHL and IBM’s $1.3bn acquisition of Kenexa. Previously conservative firms like ADP are worth watching in this space.</p>, <p><strong>Analytics as a Service providers</strong></p>, <p>Analytics as a Service firms can provide an analytics CoE capability on an outsourced basis, either to manage fluctuating capacity or specific skills. Most firms in this category will bring their own technology which enables them to automate common activities, delivering economies of scale. Whilst in other functions or sectors the market is established it is new within HR. The relatively small size of deals has made HR unattractive to date for the larger firms such as Accenture, Mu Sigma and Fractal, though all have shown interest in this area and will probably become more active as the market develops.</p>, <p>OrganizationView is an Analytics as a Service provider</p>, <p><strong>The Consultancies</strong></p>, <p>Most, if not all of the major business consultancies with HR teams are offering People Analytics service lines. Whilst many have built, and in many instances retired, People Analytics technology, their project-based services are likely to meet the needs of many HR buyers.</p>, <p>EY is a good example of a firm in this space. Assignments are likely to be in the areas of workforce planning, workforce productivity &amp; performance improvement modelling and setting up and advising analytics CoEs.</p>, <p><strong>The Start-Ups</strong></p>, <p>Some of the most exciting and advanced analytics currently being done in HR falls within this sector. Most firms in this sector make one or two products targeting niche areas. Many of these are in the area of hiring, especially for certain in-demand groups such as IT skills. The availability of large volumes of public data - including social media data - make machine learning to identify patterns possible. These services can be great add-ons to your analytics approach</p>, <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>, <p>I don’t think that any of these firms will dominate the overall market. Large organizations are likely to want to develop and manage an analytics ecosystem. It is possible that the analytics as a service providers could act as the cultivators of such an ecosystem on behalf of clients, in much the same way that an architects practice manages a host of specialists.</p>, <p>At the moment the market is immature and growing quickly. It’s a good time to be in HR analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>, <p>Andrew is one of the pioneers of the European People Analytics scene.

The 20 best HR Analytics articles of 2014,"Exit HR Practitioners, Enter Talent Analytics Algorithms",5. Ian O’Keefe,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140722211512-822901-exit-hr-practitioners-enter-talent-analytics-algorithms,"[<p><br/>“Choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life”. Confucius was the first Chief Human Resources Officer. He had it right from the beginning. His words have captured our imaginations over the years, but still, to this day, fulfilling career choices and genuine engagement among workers remains as elusive as ever.</p>, <p>Corporate mission statements – attempting to link company pursuits to <em>who we are</em> and shareholder interests to <em>how we feel</em> about our work – often fail to inspire. According to a recent Gallup survey, 87% of employees worldwide, nearly 1.2 billion people, are either “not engaged” or “actively disengaged” at work. Workplace disengagement breeds negativity, thwarts innovation, hinders growth, and generates economic losses upwards of $500 billion annually in the U.S. alone<a rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">[1]</a>.</p>, <p>The stakes are high and important questions remain unanswered. What are the sources of individual fulfillment and the drivers of productivity for each of us in the workplace? How do they change over time? How can work choices and career paths become more meaningful? The discipline of Talent Analytics – accelerated by the proliferation of BI technologies and the explosion of structured and unstructured human capital data – can bring us closer to the answers. Let’s get more specific.</p>, <p>Based on advanced statistical analysis of employee biographics, demographics, psychometrics, sociometrics, work history, performance trends, career goals, documented strengths and learning objectives, Talent Analytics algorithms will soon lead to highly customized and individualized:</p>, <p>The list goes on. In the future, we will begin to see Big Data methods driving Little Data solutions with clear and measurable benefits to the organization, workforce, and individuals.</p>, <p>Hyper-personalization (something that Marketing Analytics data scientists have been doing for years), will reshape the talent solutions of tomorrow to be tailored to individuals like never before. Being truly data-driven, the talent solutions of the future will evaluate reams of information generated by enterprise-wide programs and processes and then dynamically create customized talent “product offerings”. Workers will choose to opt in to a symbiotic data exchange with the enterprise, because traditionally static HR activities (e.g., annual performance reviews, paper-based career development plans, off-the-shelf training, informal mentorship approaches, calendar-driven succession planning exercises, etc.) will morph into integrated and fluid talent systems designed to drive personal enablement and innovation. Workers will begin to experience deep personal connections to the ways the organization can seamlessly help them be more successful. Choosing to give more data will mean regularly getting more personalized insights. This will redefine concepts like Reciprocity, Trust, and Generosity and elevate them to the forefront of cultural transformations and organizational values frameworks. Agile technology integration, beta-product experimentation, and change leadership will be crucial success factors to bring this to life.</p>, <p>While complex organizations and evolving people practices create an abundance of workforce data, generating the insights to improve business outcomes and drive innovation is a tall order. Talent Analytics clearly needs to rise to the challenge. But how? By identifying broad organization-wide performance gaps aligned to overarching business objectives? By isolating unique development needs aligned to specific goals? Yes, on both accounts. Talent Analytics insights are most powerful when they can be applied broadly across the enterprise with <em>seamless execution for all,</em> as well as deeply within specific talent segments with <em>targeted excellence for a chosen few</em>.</p>, <p>The most innovative applications of Talent Analytics – based on principles of data-driven dynamic interactions – are only beginning to emerge. When this happens, the possibilities for Human Resources as a value creator and Talent Analytics as an innovation engine will become game-changing. Corporations, universities, member-based consortia, technology platform providers, and third-party consultants all stand to benefit from a growing ecosystem of partnerships and alliances aimed at advancing the Talent Analytics discipline.</p>, <p>So, the question to ask isn’t <em>if</em> your HR function will be disrupted. It will. Rather, ask whether your HR practitioners and Executive Leadership Teams are ready to embrace Talent Analytics to reshape the future of work and reinvigorate the engagement of workers. Possibly your own work and engagement. What would Confucius say?</p>, <p>************************************************************************************</p>, <p>Throughout fifteen years of management consulting and Fortune 100 leadership roles, I have been fortunate to observe how the intersection of people, process, and technology creates almost unlimited opportunities, as well as challenges, for organizational and individual success. Exploring this intersection has been a driving force throughout my career. Currently, as the Head of Talent Analytics for Sears Holdings Corporation, I lead a team that generates operational reporting, program effectiveness models, and advanced analytic studies impacting over 220,000 employees and billions of dollars in annual labor spend. Our team advises on a variety of business issues and the skillsets we employ are equally diverse. Economics, Statistics, Psychology, Computer Science, and Management Consulting form the core of our expertise. Our end goal is to discover new accelerators of workforce Engagement, Collaboration, and Productivity that will help transform Sears Holdings into the world’s largest integrated retailer.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><a rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">[1]</a> Gallup Inc., <em>State of the Global Workplace</em>, October 2013</p>]"

The 20 best HR Analytics articles of 2014,Will HR Lose the Battle Over Analytics?,7. Karen O’Leonard,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141203005014-10425248-will-hr-lose-the-battle-over-analytics,"[<p>Most HR organizations have been slow to adopt analytics – too slow, in fact, in the minds of many impatient business leaders. <a href=""http://insights.bersin.com/research/?docid=16846"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Our research</a> conducted last year showed that just 14% of HR organizations in the U.S are using advanced or predictive analytics to make talent decisions. These companies have created strong analytics teams with a diversity of skill sets and have established data governance processes for data quality and integration.</p>, <p>Despite the prognostications that 2014 would be “the year of predictive talent analytics,” things haven’t changed all that much. I keep hearing the same questions from HR leaders over and over again: “How do I get started with analytics?” “How do we clean and integrate our data?” “How do we upskill our staff to be more data savvy?”</p>, <p>If HR continues to drag its feet, it risks losing control over its data, and its chance to gain some real power within the organization.</p>, <p>Witness the<a href=""http://ww2.cfo.com/analytics/2014/10/cfos-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""> articles</a> in support of CFOs owning analytics within corporate America. CFOs understand the value of data and are already using analytics to help them understand and predict margins, pricing models, and potential new revenue streams. For decades Finance has been using analytics to better understand where the business is strong and where it needs improvement.</p>, <p>CFOs could be a natural fit to lead analytics across the organization – taking over responsibility for HR analytics, marketing analytics, and operational analytics. Most CFOs are in a position of power within their organizations. They already control much of that data on company financials and operations. They have credibility and are seen (in many companies) as the source of truth. They understand data and know how to use it.</p>, <p>In many organizations, HR falls short on all of the above. Which is why HR risks losing control of its talent data to CFOs, who may be looking to further expand their leadership roles and spheres of influence throughout the company – and who are tired of waiting for HR leaders to “get it” when it comes to analytics.</p>, <p>I’ve already talked with several companies over the past two months that have centralized their analytics across functions. In a some cases, the CFO is running the analytics organization. In others, it falls under the COO or CIO. This should be a wake-up call for HR leaders. The battleground over corporate data is threatening to heat up, and HR can’t throw up the white flag and lose its stake in the one area that promises to bring it credibility with executives and power over talent and business decisions.</p>, <p>If your HR organization is still new to analytics, here is one thing you can do: Find a business leader who is willing to partner on an analytics project to solve a problem (e.g. reducing turnover, improving engagement, reducing accidents/theft/leakage, etc.) Put together a skunks works team, borrowing talent from another department if necessary or partnering with a university or external supplier, and look to get a small ‘win.’ After that, evangelize the results and find another internal stakeholder or two to partner with on another, slightly larger, project.</p>, <p>After you have a few small wins and have built some credibility with business leaders, you can ask for some additional resources and start building an analytics team. Many HR people say, “I can’t get the funding for analytics,” and it's no wonder...since they haven’t proven the value and their credibility yet.</p>, <p>So start small – look for a supportive business leader with a pain point - and grow from there. Any don’t wait too long, or before you know it, your CFO may be managing your talent data.</p>]"

The 20 best HR Analytics articles of 2014,Can you replace a recruiter with an algorithm?,13. Matt Alder,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141124134010-2314046-can-you-replace-a-recruiter-with-an-algorithm,"[<p>It was interesting to observe the debate that sprung up a few weeks ago when online dating giant eHarmony announced its entry into the recruitment market. A December launch has been mentioned and there is currently a <a href=""http://signup.elevatedcareers.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">holding page</a> taking email sign ups.</p>, <p>The key to the debate is whether eHarmony’s legendary matching methodologies and algorithms can in some way effectively augment or even usurp the mind of an experienced recruiter. For the most part the sides of the debate fail along predictable lines with some keen technologists saying yes and a lot of experienced recruiters dismissing the whole notion as the kind of ridiculous theoretical hype they’ve been hearing for years.</p>, <p>My own view on this is that the debate isn’t quite as black and white as some pundits seem to think it is. First of all I do think there is an inevitability that current trends in big data and machine learning will have a much more dramatic effect on recruitment than a lot of people imagine and I would recommend Erik Brynjofsson and Andrew McAfee’s book<a href=""http://www.secondmachineage.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""> “The Second Machine Age”</a> to anyone interested in what the future of work might look like. I’ve also experienced first hand just how effective eHarmony is and recently got married to the beautiful girl it quite rightly predicted was my perfect match! However I remain to be convinced that any change in recruitment will happen quickly.</p>, <p>Online recruitment remains ridiculously unsophisticated in comparison to the rest of the digital world and that makes it a seemingly easy target for disruptive investment. However, over the last ten years, it has proved to be almost impossible to properly disrupt online recruitment and I would argue that only LinkedIn have made any genuinely industry shifting impact in that time.</p>, <p>This is pretty disappointing because if there is one thing our industry is crying out for it is disruptive innovation, particularly round the area of candidate matching. Fifteen or so years ago the online recruitment revolution created a problem with application volumes for many companies that it has never properly solved. It is an issue that is so entrenched that it has actually normalized and having to sort through a large number of inappropriate applications (very often manually) is seen as part of the standard workflow of recruitment. Many established software providers claim to solve the problem but the evidence on the ground does not back this up! Despite being cited as a current big trend, improvements to the candidate experience seem to be mostly<a href=""http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/hro/features/1147461/candidate-experience-getting-worse"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""> failing to take root </a>as many recruiters fear they will be totally swamped if they “make it easier” for people to apply for jobs. The fact that we consider all of this to just be “business as usual” is insane in a world where the continuing advance of digital is changing everything around us.</p>, <p>So where is the innovation coming from? There are obviously a large number of start-ups out there who claim they can solve all of recruitment’s problems but what are the chances of any of them making it out of the often self-congratulatory recruitment tech echo chamber and into the mainstream? History would seem to suggest not very many will. The big players don’t seem to do much better either with somewhat half hearted recruitment initiatives from both Google and Facebook failing to make an impact in recent years.</p>, <p>Ultimately I think the key to change lies within the industry itself. Despite the rapid rise of LinkedIn, for the most part recruitment is still anchored round mechanics that are driven by the CV and haven’t changed in decades. The death of the CV debate is even more polarized than the algorithm debate and unfortunately I think it is holding back some of the evolution that could help make automated matching work much more effectively. No I’m not saying you should scrap formal documents and just use social data but I am saying that in a world of mobile devices the status quo will increasingly not be an option.</p>, <p>Above all I think I’m calling for some sensible discussion here. The “oh no it won’t” versus the “oh yes it will” debate round algorithmic advancement and the future of the CV might be fine for the pantomime season but we are desperately in need of more sophisticated deliberation if the industry is going to move forward.</p>]"
The 20 best HR Analytics articles of 2014,From Human Screen to Machine: Predictive Analytics Helps Avoid a Major Point of Hiring Failure,14. Greta Roberts,http://www.talentanalytics.com/blog/from-human-screen-to-machine-predictive-analytics-helps-avoid-a-major-point-of-hiring-failure/,[]
The 20 best HR Analytics articles of 2014,This is why your Data Scientist sucks,15. Benjamin Taylor,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-your-data-scientist-sucks-benjamin,"[<p>How to hire your first data scientist has been a common conversation with me lately so I figured I would share my perspective. <strong>Hiring your first data scientist is critical, that point can not be stressed enough. </strong>Hiring the right type of individual, what I am calling a<em> Type-E,</em> will launch you ahead of the competition, give you appropriate intellectual property to buffer your imitators, explode the scope of your potential data problems beyond your original hopes, and break through every damn obstacle put in their path.</p>, <p>The appropriate skills needed for a data scientist chart has spread like a virus all over the internet:</p>, <p><img data-li-src=""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQF7dmBM0R7gEA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1564012800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Dt9DjIwJx2klTWkv7w6w67qSX2DLdqMSIPj-UHPD-oo"" data-media-urn="""" height=""405"" src=""//:0"" width=""392""/></p>, <p><strong>This chart will do absolutely nothing to help you hire your first data scientist.</strong> So how do you hire one of these rare power houses to launch your new data science arm for your business? Consider these 6 points.</p>, <p><strong>1. 30,000 hour expert</strong></p>, <p>Everyone has heard of the 10,000 hour rule coined by <a href=""http://bit.ly/1z72Cgi"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Malcolm Gladwell</a> on what it takes to become an expert. For a <em>type-E</em> individual you have to raise the bar to ridiculous. If I had to throw a number out there I would say a 30,000 hour expert. The main point that this is hitting on is you need to find an individual where data science is not a career, curriculum, or hobby, but an addiction. They hack every day and going on vacation without their laptop or a high-speed internet connection gives them anxiety. What experience does someone need? We are talking 10 years of serious daily hacking, not necessarily school. Advanced degrees are optional, it depends on the merit of the individual. Below is a study from Burtch Works from 171 data scientists that shows advanced degrees are common but not required.</p>, <p><img data-li-src=""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQFVK3fSIJPazQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1564012800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=aPTDgbxVbasqzI3LVOWbd5PspJvLTI9JhN-5kX839uU"" data-media-urn="""" height=""472"" src=""//:0"" width=""494""/>Likewise, the majority of PhD graduates from top schools will fail this screen because they lack the addiction and time factor. They have chosen data science because it is a great career choice.</p>, <p><img data-li-src=""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQHyU428eqw_2g/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1564012800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=BH7kEdeLdHL6eyhrPtX7OU9PaGmXpngiU9pGibGFYLQ"" data-media-urn="""" height=""281"" src=""//:0"" width=""588""/></p>, <p><strong>2. Reality Distortion On High</strong></p>, <p>Steve Jobs is associated with the term reality distortion. The individual you want as your first data scientist has such a high degree of unstoppability that they begin to bleed into the category of reality distortion. You also want to make sure you are looking at someone who has been burned before (some experience when things don't work out as expected). They will succeed and break through any barrier in their path. So many data scientists out there are constrained to similar problems, classes, and types they have seen before. #LimitedToTheBook</p>, <p><strong><img data-li-src=""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQG_0WD2-tkCcg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1564012800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=RFFvC_vANbpstUhOPSGzYQjkypINrsj9fyt7VY79yao"" data-media-urn="""" height=""446"" src=""//:0"" width=""588""/></strong></p>, <p><strong>3. High On Crazy</strong></p>, <p>The best data scientists are the crazy ones, crazy passionate, willing to do whatever it takes to succeed. Someone exceeding the new 30,000 hour rule has a ridiculous amount of self-taught experience. Their toolkit is massive, and the problems they have encountered are very diverse. For the common data scientist branches (coding, hacking, stats/math) they should be very strong on all of them compared to their data science peers. A high degree of crazy/hyper-confidence is often found in the <em>type-E</em> individual.</p>, <p><img data-li-src=""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQHbRFaUYSUaAg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0?e=1564012800&amp;v=beta&amp;t=g9fjL1nvEiWrsaKzQExwYiqs5Tk4wxKSmJ3QnKoq6TA"" data-media-urn="""" height=""331"" src=""//:0"" width=""588""/></p>, <p><strong>4. Previous Intellectual Property Experience</strong></p>, <p>If you are in a market where you have imitators and you need intellectual property development to protect your buffer you need to consider hiring someone with previous experience. LaTeX or Markdown are common filters used to find someone that might have this experience. Also, if someone is solid in the first three points they may be able to stretch into this area as well if they are lacking with examples. So I wouldn't use this as a hard filter, but a bonus.</p>, <p><strong>5. Large Social Footprint/Skills</strong></p>, <p>Someone with a large social footprint is most likely actively engaged in the community. Claiming to be the smartest individual in a room of peers is a dramatically different statement if they know their peer pool well. Also, most likely after you hire this individual you will need them to build out a data science team of top data scientists in the future. That will be hard for them to do if they don't know what they are looking for, or if they don't have strong ties with the data science community. Another thing to consider with this is your first data scientist will need to be customer facing. They will likely be interacting with your largest customers around data solutions or algorithms they are developing and beta testing MVPs with them. So during the screening phase ask yourself ""Do I feel comfortable with this individual leading a technical call with my most valuable customer?"". If the answer is no move on.</p>, <p><strong>6. Volatile Ambition</strong></p>, <p>A <em>type-E</em> individual doesn't settle anywhere. If you ask an individual where do you see yourself in 5 years and they respond ""Not working here"" you have found a real winner. If they see themselves retiring with you move on. <em>Type-E</em> individuals are also rare because their ambition is sucking them into full time independent consulting roles where they make more than you are willing to pay them, or their ambitions for launching a billion dollar startup are also pulling on them.

The 20 best HR Analytics articles of 2014,HR 2020: We Need Data Scientists Now!,16. Dave Millner,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141127151203-14746355-hr-2020-we-need-data-scientists-now?trk=prof-post,"[<p>Over the years many articles have been written about what’s wrong with HR. The usual challenges emerge such as:</p>, <p>Some of this may be true but having worked in and around HR for over 25 years now it is a really difficult profession that is once again going through a lot of change; the fact that every manager regards themselves as an “HR expert” (when they want to be) doesn’t help the situation!</p>, <p>Business has evolved from the archaic infrastructure of subjectivity and guesswork to an analytical metric based system where virtually a whole organisation has been ‘metricized’ from finance, sales, marketing through to distribution. However, on this journey HR has failed to fully adapt and communicate its’ continued relevance. Traditionally, HR decisions were more intuitive and grounded in relationships and driven by skills frameworks, on-boarding and retention objectives supported by knowledge sharing. However as consumers, customers and employees alike become smarter with a greater sense of options, HR is being pushed into justifying (retrospectively) its’ decision making and is now being expected to predict the future outcomes of decisions. In the ever changing marketplace with an increasing demand for talent, predicting that the right number of people with the right skills are in the right place at the right time to deliver outcomes in line with organizational strategies has become paramount. At the same time HR is expected to find ways to engage, balance flexibility and cost, attract, grow and predict the churn rate of employees – that’s why the role of HR is so challenging!</p>, <p>The shift that seems to be emerging is that ‘a new type of HR practitioner’ is required to meet the demands of both today and HR 2020; some could even say that this is the ‘last chance saloon’ and that the change has to be both tangible and transformational otherwise HR will be left behind in the operational mire of a digital world!.</p>, <p><strong>2020: The Future Is Here</strong><br/>The year is 2020, the world of work has been digitally transformed by embedded artificial intelligence systems, social media is how we collaborate and deliver services with new forms of automation arriving all the time. The workplace is predominantly remote and is no longer defined by a smart glass designed building or office, low level skilled jobs have mainly been replaced by machines and outsourcing and collaboration is at an all time high with human optimization capabilities being driven by data analytics. HR as we know it no longer exists and has evolved into a real time ‘Performance’ function with the old Finance function and is an extended arm of the executive board with data metrics and ROI driving people based decisions and programs.</p>, <p>The new ‘Performance’ function is not just able to aggregate and forecast in each business area of the organisation what the overall retention trends are and the overall propensity to stay or leave the organisation is, but to predict intention to leave and retention risk per employee, based on the factors that determine whether or not an employee is still impressionable or is at the point of no return (leaving regardless of any intervention). Managers are given automated real time updates of potential retention risks dependent on holistic analytics of the employee, for example, gender, engagement level, social networking content and activity, capability profiles, skills gaps, skill utilization, challenge and frequency.<br/>The manager is then equipped to discuss and explore intentions and concerns with the employee with an indication of whether this employee is impressionable or at the point of no return. Performance management has been replaced with ad hoc conversations and managers have true accountability for compensation based on demonstrated performance – no more can HR be blamed for their policies blocking pay rises and bonuses!</p>, <p>Every employee has their own Return on Investment (ROI) – the world has changed with technology being the enabler, but to get to that point HR has changed significantly in terms of its’ commercial outlook, the capabilities required to operate within it and the focus that it has to provide ‘real time’ people based insights that are totally orientated towards improving the ‘bottom line’.</p>, <p><strong>Outcomes and Considerations</strong> <br/>HR leaders are very aware of the importance of the need to be ‘strategic’ (whatever that means!) and the need to influence top management on people issues that they have to own. The HR of yesterday has been more operational and reactive which has meant that crisis based management has come into play often agreeing to unreasonable or low priority requests that add limited value to the organization given the time and resource cost involved. The new era of HR has to command the attention of the CEO and the C-Suite by working smarter and demonstrating specific behaviours that are aligned to the CEO’s key business criteria and in turn drive more measurable returns on investment. The outcome overview for the new HR looks like this:</p>, <p><strong>Breakthrough thinking</strong> - Due to the more scientific stance that the HR community needs to take, the HR leaders will be more confident to 'sit at the table' with the CEO and their team to give commercial related advice and be directly accountable for business critical people initiatives and their implementation. Predictive analytics for example will allow HR to demonstrate value by developing forecasts and potential problem areas that can keep organizational surprises to a minimum.</p>, <p>This is where the “art of HR” remains crucial to help make sense of what all this data is saying!</p>, <p><strong>The Commercial Adviser</strong> - Predictive analytics essentially allows HR to anticipate problem areas and provide solutions before the CEO and their top teams ask questions. This is likely to position HR leaders in a way that makes them look valuable and attractive. These could include:</p>, <p><strong>HR as a Brand</strong> - HR can have great initiatives, solutions and science; however if HR is not perceived to be a credible function then it will result in a lot of wasted energy and frustration. Implementing simple marketing techniques can ensure that</p>, <p>HR is noticed for what it delivers:</p>, <p>HR is in a race against time, the hard truth is that many HR functions continue to be downsized or outsourced at the very time when the opportunity to really show value is here. It is fundamental for HR to align itself with the key stakeholders across the organisation and speak their commercial language. To do this, HR must quantify its output in tangible commercially orientated ways that are intrinsically linked into what is important to the executive board and the organization with a keen focus on the future and how that impacts and drives the present. HR has to become more of a scientist that looks for data and makes sense of it rather than rely on the old ‘trust me I’m in HR’ – it didn’t work in the past and it certainly won’t work in the future.</p>, <p>Data breeds confidence in decisions and the ability to persuade and influence people to your way of thinking through a business case approach; if it was easy HR would have done it years ago and it certainly is a significant mind-set change, but one that will really enable HR to operate at a different level!</p>, <p>Whilst HR 2020 is only 5 years away, my point is that we in HR need to start making changes now!!!!</p>, <p>Dave Millner Alex Nelson-Williams<br/>Follow me at @HRCurator Follow me at @HR_Toolkit</p>]"

The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,People Analytics Takes Off: 10 Things We’ve Learned,1. Josh Bersin | People Analytics Takes Off: 10 Things We’ve Learned,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-takes-off-ten-things-weve-learned-josh-bersin,"[<p>I recently had the opportunity to present the ""State of the Market"" at a major People Analytics conference here in San Francisco, and I turned it into a ""top 10"" list.  In this article I'll briefly review them and let you view the slides for more detail.</p>, <p><strong>1.  People Analytics is even more important than we thought.</strong></p>, <p>Our new research (Deloitte Human Capital Trends 2015) shows that 87% of business leaders are highly concerned about retention and engagement, 86% about leadership, and more than 85% about current workforce skills. Despite the vast amount of engagement surveys in businesses, Glassdoor ratings for the average company are 3.1 out of 5 (around a C), with almost a perfect bell curve distribution.  Companies desperately need data to figure out what makes people join, what makes people stay, who is likely to be most successful, and what we can do to build more leadership, customer service, and innovation in the team. All these problems can be directly informed by great People Analytics.</p>, <p><em>Fig 1:  Glassdoor company ratings, 20,000+ August 2015</em></p>, <p><strong>2.  People Analytics will grow exponentially, but we are in the early days.</strong></p>, <p>Our research (Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends 2015) showed that the maturity of People Analytics in HR has barely budged in the last year. Does this mean the market is stalled?</p>, <p>No, rather the opposite. Most business trends we study don't grow in a straight line - they grow in an ""exponential curve."" What this means is that in the early days it seems like nothing is happening - companies are experimenting, vendors are building tools, and only a few examples seem to keep coming up. Here is an example of a simple exponential curve:</p>, <p><em>Fig 2:  Exponential Growth Curve (compliments of Theemergingfuture.com)</em></p>, <p>As you can see, for many years the line appears to be flat - but then suddenly it takes off. (Genomic research went this way, as did internet bandwidth, memory density, and most other technological breakthroughs.)</p>, <p>In the case of People Analytics, companies are just now starting to figure this out, and we had almost 300 ""Geeks"" with us last week, telling me that this market is ready to hit the knee in the curve. In the next ten years I expect the market to start doubling at a bigger and bigger increment each year, until ten years from now this will become a very standard part of HR.</p>, <p>By the way, as I shared at the meeting, most other analytics disciplines in business went through a similar evolution.  Marketing analytics took about 20 years to mature - and today you can buy off the shelf analytics solutions that rival hugely expensive custom customer data warehouse  projects of only ten years ago.</p>, <p><em>Fig 3:  History of business analytics, Bersin by Deloitte</em></p>, <p><strong>#3.  Most companies still don't really know what People Analytics really is.</strong></p>, <p>Despite lots of great articles and references to the book <em>Moneyball</em>, most HR executives and leaders are still a little confused about what's going on here. Many think People Analytics is about computing retention rates and better identifying how many employees we have. Some think it's a way to measure the ROI of training or other HR programs.  Our research shows that it's much more - it's bringing together the people data in the company (and there is an ever-expanding amount and set of that data) to solve specific business problems:  sales productivity, retention, fraud, customer satisfaction, etc.</p>, <p><em>Fig 4:  Redefining People Analytics (Bersin by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p>""This is not your father's HR data warehouse"" - and it's not ""HR analytics"" either - this is taking all the wonderful data we have about people and putting it to work on very specific business problems. As I explained in my talk, over time I don't think it even belongs in HR - it is likely to move into operations.  (We can discuss that in another article.)</p>, <p><strong>#4.  Data Management remains the biggest barrier.</strong></p>, <p>We had some amazing companies in this meeting (most of the leading Silicon Valley companies, many large financial institutions, manufacturers, and others) and most of them agreed:  their HR data was ""bad.""  HR and people data is inconsistent, unclean (not correct), out of date, and located in many places. Many large companies still don't really know how many salaried or contract employees they have at a given time, so these teams are dealing with a big data integration problem.</p>, <p><em>Fig 5:  Bersin by Deloitte Talent Analytics Maturity Model</em></p>, <p>Our research (Bersin by Deloitte High-Impact Talent Analytics research) shows that more than 80% of companies are stuck dealing with reporting challenges, and while this problem is starting to go away it still plagues most companies. Every company in the room talked about these challenges, and most agreed that there is a lot of ""technical debt"" to clean up in order to really scale their operations.  (But most agreed the are funding this work and will do it!)</p>, <p><strong>#5.  Modelling is valuable but implementing models is key.</strong></p>, <p>My fifth finding is that we all love models: a great model that predicts retention, a model that predicts the right paths to leadership, a model that tells us how much salary to pay high performers, etc. These models are incredibly valuable - but as the book and movie <em>Moneyball</em> pointed out very clearly, ""having the answer does not make it happen.""</p>, <p>The hardest part of People Analytics is <em><strong>implementing the changes recommended by the model- which means that People Analytics teams have to be surrounded by very good change management consultants.  </strong></em>I talked with a large company that discovered they were underpaying their high performers and overpaying their mid-level performers (the analysis proved this very accurately). But despite knowing this, the company had a 20 year culture of ""fairness"" and ""equality of pay."" It took several years of effort to teach managers (and the organization itself) that people were going to be treated more ""unfairly"" going forward, and it was ok to give someone a huge raise for high performance and a middling raise for fair performance. The HR team told me it was much harder to implement this than they ever imagined.</p>, <p><strong>#6.  Tools and platforms are here, but there are no Unicorns or Gorillas yet</strong></p>, <p>As with all emerging markets, there are dozens of new tools, technologies, and platforms now available to help you analyze people data. I wont list them here, but suffice it to say, none are Billion dollar companies (Unicorns), and none are Gorillas (read Geoffrey Moore's <em>Crossing the Chasm</em> to understand that concept).</p>, <p>As Moore's book points out, when the market gets hot (we enter the Tornado), the smaller companies that don't have clear ""market leadership"" get shaken out, and big companies (like the big ERP players) take over.  Almost every major ERP software company is investing in this area (Workday, Oracle, SAP, ADP, IBM, Ceridian, Ultimate, Saba, Cornerstone, and more) - and there are dozens of tools companies (text analytics, retention analytics, sentiment analysis, and even companies that analyze your physical location, your heart rate, and your exercise).  One vendor even analyzes your emails, to see your pattern of communication, helping with what is called Organizational Network Analysis.</p>, <p>All these smallish companies are doing great things, but as the market matures (and it will in the next few years), they'll either ""get big fast"" or ""get bought.""  So my warning to buyers is just ""beware"" and to vendors:  find your ""bowling pin"" (the part of the market you can hit) and knock it down.  Don't try to be all things to all people, when the market heats up you'll be glad you own some part of this huge market.</p>, <p><strong>#7.  The Geeks will rule this world, but not alone.</strong></p>, <p>This is one I really want to emphasize:  while we need data scientists and statisticians to analyze and build models, the real discipline of People Analytics is very multi-disciplinary. Successful teams include process people, consultants, OD experts, I/O psychologists, visual designers, as well as core IT people. You'll need all these people coming together to make your team work - and yes, this will become a new Center of Excellence in HR - one that must report to the CHRO, not be buried in the HR technology team.</p>, <p><em>Fig 6:  The People Analytics Center of Excellence (Bersin by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p><strong>#8.  We will have to deal with many new types of data, and new ways of analyzing it.</strong></p>, <p>The days of analyzing payroll, HRMS, and time and attendance data are over. That isn't nearly enough. Today we have to look at employee engagement survey data, email history data, employee badge and sociometric data (even voice patterns and who you have lunch with), and all the data which will come from wearable devices. Remember your employees are walking around with video cameras and GPS devices all day, so much of the data we will look at over time will be based on location, time, and visual identity.  (One vendor just announced a lathe that identifies its operator by face, and then automatically readjusts its equipment for the person.) </p>, <p><strong>9.  Security and anonymity will become your middle name.</strong></p>, <p>Thanks to the various credit card and other security breaches we have witnessed recently, employees and legal departments are very nervous about the analysis we do. HR departments and People Analytics team have to take a crash course in data security, privacy, and identity protection. People are beginning to get worried about what this data is being used for.</p>, <p>10.  We have to work together - we are all learning now.</p>, <p>My final point is this:  while much of what we do here will become proprietary competitive advantage to our companies, right now the more we share and learn the better we all are.  Just as the human genome was decoded through the work of many academics sharing information, so must we all share what we are learning so we can move this industry past the ""hobby phase"" to true industrial scale.</p>, <p>While more and more companies are starting to keep their People Analytics findings confidential, most are sharing what they've learned - because it's not the ""findings"" that make your company unique, it's what you do about them.  </p>, <p>We learned from HIQ Labs, for example, that employees are 150% more likely to quit if a peer leaves the company than if a manager leaves the company.  This seems like a somewhat obvious finding - so let's share it. The real key is what will you do about it!</p>, <p>I think People Analytics is one of the most exciting trends in business, and we are here to help you (and your HR teams and leaders) understand it, leverage it, and make sure you're taking advantage of it in the coming years.  I welcome your comments and feel free to share your stories.</p>, <p>----</p>, <p><em>About the Author: Josh Bersin is the founder and Principal of <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin by Deloitte</a>, Deloitte Consulting LLP, a leading research and advisory firm focused on corporate leadership, talent, learning, and the intersection between work and life.

The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,2015 in People Analytics,2. Andrew Marritt | 2015 in People Analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2015-people-analytics-andrew-marritt?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>At university, my Econometrics Professor used to always say ‘don’t predict the future as you’ll most likely be wrong’. (He also was paid every year by a big investment bank who wanted him to try and do just that.) Hence in this post I decided to end the year taking a look back at 2015 and what has happened in People Analytics, seen through the lens of one of Europe’s prominent People Analytics practices.</p>, <p><strong>People Analytics has taken off</strong></p>, <p>I think 2015 was the year when we started to see real momentum in firms doing People Analytic projects. Let’s be clear, most firms still aren’t doing anything substantial but those who are are now starting to bring it into most of their initiatives creating ongoing and substantial demand. Those who haven’t started are certainly being left behind.</p>, <p>There is certainly more hiring in this space. Our clients have increasingly got numerous people in their HR analytics functions. The skill levels are increasing. We know several firms with strong, analytical Phds in their teams and an increasing number of analytical MBAs. An increasing number of our projects have 'knowledge transfer' as an aim.</p>, <p><strong>HR leaders are eager to become more data-fluent</strong></p>, <p>In 2015 we’ve run analytics training in Europe and Asia and the diary already includes sessions throughout 2016. The audiences have always been similar - senior level HR managers who want to understand enough about analytics to be able to identify opportunities, select vendors and generally feel confident using data to inform decision making.</p>, <p>We’re seeing this move down through the organization, and to more junior levels of HR. We focus on providing skills to help people think analytically rather than teaching how to do analytics. Knowing how to manage analysts will become a core skill for HR and managers need to know enough so that these relations can be fruitful.</p>, <p><strong>Predictive analytics is rapidly becoming standard</strong></p>, <p>OK, so I have a big problem with people using a binary classification between ‘doing’ and ‘not doing’ predictive analytics. We’ve always, since founding in 2010, been using machine learning techniques to help make better decision making for HR. It’s pretty straightforward to build a simple model but to increase the accuracy or usefulness requires greater and greater effort. </p>, <p>It also shouldn’t be seen as an activity which can be completely automated. There is a big difference between taking photos of your friends with your smartphone and creating work like Nan Goldin. As any analyst knows, there’s a lot of craft in building models. It takes time to learn, domain knowledge is vital - not just of HR but also of the specific business situation and how the data has been collected.</p>, <p>In 2015 we saw a continuing push by most big HR technology vendors to provide ‘predictive analytics’ into their products. Clients need to understand whether these generic models are good enough for their needs. My suggestion is that if you’re wanting to gain competitive advantage they’re probably not. There's also a question of how the results are applied but that probably demands a post to itself.</p>, <p><strong>Graph analysis is becoming more regularly used</strong></p>, <p>The next two trends I predicted during a presentation that I made when I chaired HR Tech Europe’s Big Data conference in early 2013. They’ve now really come to fruition.</p>, <p>Last year <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141127114600-78008-in-hr-analytics-don-t-be-constrained-by-your-data-structure?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">I wrote a post on graph or network data structures</a> and how they provided a different way at looking at your data, enabling new questions to be answered. For us 2015 was the year when using graph analysis became mainstream.</p>, <p>I can’t think of one project this year which didn’t involve some form of graph analysis. Some of the time it was about the relationships people had within their businesses but often it was simply to look at data, or metadata from a different perspective.</p>, <p>Our dominant tool for graph analysis this year has been <a href=""http://igraph.org/redirect.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">igraph</a> used via the R package. I got a very nice, slightly early Christmas present when <a href=""http://gephi.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gephi 0.9</a> was launched on 20 December. During my training I use the wonderfully user-friendly yet powerful <a href=""http://www.polinode.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Polinode</a> to teach networks and network thinking to teams of senior HR managers.</p>, <p><strong>Text analytics is providing a rich goldmine of information</strong></p>, <p>I wrote in the <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-text-analytics-changing-employee-survey-andrew-marritt?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">last post</a> about how text analytics is transforming the employee survey, a central part of our <a href=""http://www.workometry.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Workometry</a> platform. However in 2015 we saw a strong demand in text-analytics-centric work across HR.</p>, <p>Some of my favourite uses of text analytics have been from looking at 360 review data and even with operational data from a large shared service centre. Text projects almost always involve graph analysis and prediction.</p>, <p>In 2015 we’ve learnt that few HR tech vendors have ever expected the data in text fields of their data to be analysed. It is no longer, unfortunately, a surprise to find numerous systems-generated quasi-xml littering a text-field data extraction. 2015 was the year we got very good at regular expressions.</p>, <p><strong>HR Analytics platforms have fallen flat (with some exceptions)</strong></p>, <p>What we haven’t seen in 2015 is a growth in the usage of dedicated HR Analytics platforms. I covered these last year in a post on <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141112084226-78008-the-5-types-of-hr-analytics-vendors?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">The 5 types of HR Analytics Vendors</a> (they’re the technologists).</p>, <p>I think that HR Analytics platforms fall into a difficult space. On one side we see the rise of more sophisticated analytics in HR systems as standard functionality. On the other there’s a realisation that to do the job well requires business-specific models / good analysts. The platforms find themselves in the middle - arguably in no-mans land.</p>, <p>There are some vendors which we like. In 2012 <a href=""http://blog.hrtecheurope.com/two-innovative-european-hr-analytics-products-orgvue-and-organizationweaver/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">I wrote about OrgVue</a> and it’s been good to see how they’ve risen. I like what the <a href=""http://talent-lab.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Lab</a> team have built. In both these instances the platforms arguably have taken a specific analytic need and built a tool which meets that need. They’re not trying to provide an all-encompassing solution.</p>, <p>It’s this specific-need route we’re taking with our two products. Workometry can be used by analytics teams in their models - the datastore can be queried directly by the clients' team and the data comes in a very modelling-friendly manner though of course it can be used as a service in it’s own right. We’re currently working with a few clients on another, early Beta product which takes ‘standard’ data from HR systems and automatically generates the type of features / variables that are typically needed in predictive HR models. I suspect this will end up being an API service.</p>, <p><strong>2015 conferences</strong></p>, <p>I suspect that we’re getting close to saturation with People Analytics conferences and that over time People Analytics will just become part of most HR conferences. </p>, <p>In 2015 we did over one conference presentation / chair a month and it was great to see them moving from ‘why do analytics’ to really sharing some successes. It was also flattering to find clients talking about some of our work at conferences, sometimes even without our prior knowledge.</p>, <p>If I had to pick one presentation that I enjoyed doing in 2015 it was the one that I gave at HR Tech Europe in London on ‘Open Source People Analytics’ where I tried to show what People Analysts actually do using tools such as R and RapidMiner.</p>, <p>During the hour demonstration I showed how to visualise data using ggplot2 with labour market data via calls to <a href=""http://www.quandl.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">quandl</a>. Using R I did live analysis of the conference twitter stream and geospatial analysis using UK supermarket locations, including calling APIs to get driving times between locations. I demonstrated building simple prediction models using RapidMiner. Of course being live things didn’t completely go to plan but it was huge fun and I got great feedback from the audience.</p>, <p><strong>2015 thanks</strong></p>, <p>There are far too many people and teams to include here so apologies if I miss you out.</p>, <p>Of course the first and biggest thanks goes to the OrganizationView team for doing such great work, being always open to try new things and for putting up with my demands to discuss algorithm selection. We achieved great things &amp; I couldn’t have achieved it without them.</p>, <p>A very close second goes to our clients. We’ve had some great problems to solve this year and of course they pay the bills. We can all say we’ve learnt a huge amount helping solve some thought-provoking and challenging issues. </p>, <p>We couldn’t do what we do without the great work that the R community has done this year. R really goes from strength to strength and should probably be the default choice for HR analytics teams. I suppose a related thanks must go to all those who pose and answer questions on stackoverflow.</p>, <p>Finally, a big thanks to my peers in other analytics firms and those who are providing great services &amp; tools to this ecosystem. Even though we often compete I think in general the community has made a big contribution to raising and refining the awareness of People Analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>, <p>Andrew is one of the pioneers of the European People Analytics scene.

The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,The 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics (revisited),6. Patrick Coolen |,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-revisited-patrick-coolen?trk=prof-post,"[<p>Time flies in the world of HR analytics. Not even a year after I first posted the 10 golden rules of HR analytics I feel it is already time to update most of the lessons learned. And that is a good thing. Because learning is fun and HR analytics is simply developing at a fast pace. Our organisation conducted several new researches, using more data sources (e.g. engagement data, competency data, leadership data, mobility data, revenue data, client satisfaction data, call handling data), using new techniques (e.g. cluster analysis, classification trees) and answering more business questions then less then a year ago, covering areas as retail, private banking, corporate banking and IT.</p>, <p>But we also learn from our peers in other organisations because of the summits we visit or simply by all the great posts on social media. Just to mention a few of the great reads from HR analytics practitioners that inspired me in 2015 because they were provocative and insightful: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-hr-analytics-avoids-being-management-fad-hedegaard-rasmussen"" target=""_blank""><em>How HR analytics avoids being a management fad</em></a> by Thomas Rasmussen and Dave Ulrich. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-fail-hr-analytics-lessons-from-leading-loser-mark-berry?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank""><em>How to Fail at HR Analytics - Lessons from a Leading Loser</em></a> by Mark Berry. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/problem-hr-analytics-mike-west"" target=""_blank""><em>The problem of HR Analytics</em></a> by Mike West. Beside these practitioners I want to mentioned some leading HR analytics influencers who are always on top of their game: Luk Smeyers and Jeroen Delmotte (<a href=""http://www.inostix.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix</a>), Andrew Marrit (<a href=""http://www.organizationview.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">OrganisationView</a>), Tracey Smit (<a href=""http://www.numericalinsights.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Numerical Insights</a>), Dave Millner (IBM Workforce Science), John Sumser (<a href=""https://www.keyinterval.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">KeyInterval Research</a>), Pasha Roberts (<a href=""http://www.talentanalytics.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Analytics</a>) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrgreen"" target=""_blank"">David Green</a> (Cielo). So there is more then enough to read and learn if you want to know more on HR analytics.</p>, <p>As a recap for those who are not familiar with HR analytics: With analytics I mean applying statistical methods, like regression analyses or algorithms, on datasets that combine HR and business data, in order to support decision making. So we go beyond reporting. Now let us look again at the 10 golden rules of HR analytics (revisited). All observations in the previous version are still valid, but I hope this version provides you with some additional views. I shuffled the 10 golden rules a little bit, just to give room for some new insights. So read them all because there are some new ones.</p>, <p><strong>I. Strategic workforce planning &amp; analytics</strong>: HR speaks the language of strategic workforce planning. HR knows the vocabulary of business strategies and workforce supply and demand. They do not necessarily know the world of statistics, research or machine learning. But in our experience it works perfectly fine to start talking about business strategies to find out what is needed for the workforce, to finally end up doing research on HR and business data.</p>, <p>Let us say for example that a business strongly believes that a high internal individual mobility rate is beneficial for their business strategy and corresponding goals. At this point analytics jumps in and proposes to investigate the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between the mobility rate and business outcomes, to in the end either support or reject that hypothesis. In other words, if you put your money on high internal mobility or for example specific leadership styles, specific competencies or expensive training programmes, you better make sure you investigate whether your investments will have an impact on actual business outcomes. To be honest, we never changed workforce strategies dramatically, but we are always able to focus or fine tune activities and investments within the strategic workforce planning process where applying analytics. In short, strategic workforce planning generates ideas for analytical research and vice versa. This is one of the reasons we decided to position the expertise on strategic workforce planning and HR analytics in one department.</p>, <p><strong>II. Combine analytics &amp; intuition</strong>: It is all about decision-making. And why shouldn’t we use data analyses to support decision-making? We all know by now that humans are biased in many different ways. If you are not convinced (or biased) just read <em>Thinking, fast and slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman. On the other hand, only relying on data analysis to make your decision is also not sufficient. Gut feeling, instinct or intuitions do play an important role. The creativity of human thinking can point you in the right direction. For instance, including data sets, testing hypotheses or considering explanations you did not think of before. In the end, experience, intuition and analytics will have to work together to get the best results and insights. So make sure you have business experts, HR domain experts and analytical experts in the same room to look at the models and interpret the research results. Data analyses inspire intuition and vice versa.</p>, <p><strong>III. Make analytics business relevant and actionable</strong>: Please make sure your research has business relevance. Best thing to do is to get approval from senior management to perform your research. In this way your research results will be taken seriously. And it is not so hard to convince senior management. I just ask them two questions. The first one is “What are your most important key performance indicators?“ The answers of course can vary per business line from customer satisfaction, revenues, costs to improved quality or a combination of many. And because they are key performance indicators, there should be data available. So focus your research on exactly those key performance indicators that are most important to your business. The second question is ”Would you like to know how HR factors are influencing your key performance indicators?” There is no person who will answer that question with, “No, I am not interested”. So find the budget and get started.</p>, <p>Be aware that you manage expectations during your research. Gathering business data and data cleaning may be a burden and slow down your research project. So keep senior management in the loop during all stages. And do make sure your insights are actionable. You can deliver research insights without actions once, maybe twice, but then business will see your research as irrelevant. It is not always easy to translate results into action. Our department supports HR business partners and the business in doing so. But your research results should potentially have an impact on policies or future interventions. Knowing the results is not enough. Your organization must be willing to act on them.</p>, <p><strong>IV. Involve legal &amp; compliance</strong>: We do not start any project without approval from legal and compliance. Furthermore we even show legal our results before going to our business. Of course anonymity of individual data is key. And in our case various types of data like health or email data are out of limit. But another very important aspect of this type of research is the goal or intention of the research. What are you going to investigate and with what purpose? The end results will be evaluated against the initial goal of the research. We also received some good advice from legal on what to look for when using third party analytical software. Of course IT security is extremely important. But also taking in to account the actual location (country) of the stored data and ensuring your vendor is compliant with local and European regulations is of huge importance.</p>, <p><strong>V. Think of the skills you need</strong>: One of the most asked questions we hear when talking about HR analytics is: “What different type of capabilities does my team need to successfully start with HR analytics?” Based on my experience as a practitioner, only those organizations that manage to create and maintain a balanced blend of different relevant capabilities will be successful in HR analytics. Balanced, because too much focus on one specific capability can have some negative side effects. For example, being to scientific regarding statistical modeling may unnecessarily slow down your research or even worse you might end up with a high quality research nobody cares about. Blended, because you simply need more than one capability to do HR analytics. The HR analytics capability wheel groups the relevant capabilities in 6 different perspectives. For more details on the HR analytics wheel please read my previous post “<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/practitioners-view-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen"" target=""_blank"">A practitioner’s view on HR analytics</a>”.</p>, <p>In our experience the business subject matter expert, who works with the business data on a daily basis, brings in vital skills to your project. Do not think that you will understand and interpret the business data all by your own. The business subject matter expert has in depth knowledge to co-design the logical models in the first phase. They can possibly explain missing values or data inconsistencies during the data exploration phase. And last but not least they can really help you interpret the results of the analyses before you bring them to senior management. In most cases the SME is very supportive when it comes to data research. This also makes them an excellent ambassador for your research within the organisation and specifically their business.</p>, <p><strong>VI. Start small &amp; be realistic</strong>: If you have a dataset you can start with analytics today. If you have two datasets you can connect them and, depending on complexity, start with analytics the day after. Just use SPSS, SAS, R or ask an external vendor to do the analyses for you. You do not have to wait until you have all the data you ideally want for the research. Just start with what you have and run a second project once you have new data available to run more sophisticated models. You will experience a steeper learning curve when you start small and learn from there. If you are going to start small then please make sure your first research has actual business relevance. So start small but if possible combine HR and business data. It will be the quickest way to prove the value of HR analytics.</p>, <p>Doing analytics should not be under estimated. Analytics, although you can start small, is hard work and it takes a while before you agree on the research question and model, before you receive the right data, before you connect the datasets and before you checked data quality and cleaned the data. These steps take approximately 75% of the whole research project. Once this is done you can relatively quickly run the models and interpret the results. A wise thing to do is not to give a final delivery date before you received all the datasets. And do plan some extra time for analyses after receiving the first results. You probably want to do some extra analyses before you finalize your results and go to the business. We recognise four steps in our approach.<strong> </strong></p>, <p><strong>VII. Understand the models and its outcomes: </strong>Running a model over one period can provide you with great insights. But are these insights sustainable? Do they occur within more then one period? You are likely to see different effects in different periods. We choose to only advice on those effects that occur in multiple periods. So in other words, be careful telling your business what to do based on one model. The key here is repetition. Try to run models over multiple periods, try to predict and try to improve your models over time.</p>, <p>A partner can help you with the interpretation of the models, but our experience is that you should know your statistics yourself. Of course you have time to learn, but not having any skills or experience in statistics or algorithms makes you unable to do the necessary sanity checks on what your data and models tell you. For instance, always have a look at your data and do descriptive analyses (e.g. averages, spread, correlation, ANOVA). You have to know your data. This step allows you to determine the preferred method of analyses and maybe you want to exclude, sum or e.g. categorise variables.</p>, <p><strong> VIII. Try (when ready) s</strong><strong>elf service analytics: </strong>A new important dimension to add to the maturity of HR analytics and the 10 golden rules, is the usage of self-service analytical software. Of course several vendors already offer strong analytical functionality (e.g. SAS, SPSS or open source statistical programming tools like R) and other offer user-friendly interfaces and strong visualisation options (e.g. Tableau, Qlikview, SiSense, TIBCO Spotfire, Crunchr, Visier). The problem however is two-fold. One, there are no vendors yet that excel in both. Two, for more complex analyses, the user is still in most cases a skilled analytical user. So to my opinion, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-big-thing-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen"" target=""_blank"">the next big thing in HR analytics</a>, or analytics in general, is bringing all these functionalities as self-service software to actual (non technical) business users. This will definitely help our organisation to speed up the HR analytical process and increase our analytical maturity. We are experimenting via iNostix our partner with a self-service machine-learning tool and the first results are promising. We validate the outcomes of the machine learning tools against classical statistical methods to be sure it provides solid insights. </p>, <p><strong>IX. Preach analytics</strong>: Once you have the results start sharing them! Not only with your customer but also with relevant HR experts within recruitment, talent development, reward, learning and so on. Preach the benefits of analytics to everyone who wants to hear it. Last year we organised a summer course where we shared all of the high level results from our research to most of our HR staff. This increased the awareness within the HR community. But you have to be persistent in your preaching. This year we issued a small booklet with all our results categorised into several HR themes like leadership, mobility, reward, engagement, competencies and diversity. But I guess I am also lucky to work in an organisation where there is a lot of appetite for analytics.</p>, <p> <strong>X. Teach analytics</strong>: Finally provide your HR community with regular workshops to explain the principles of HR analytics. We developed two workshops, one on strategic workforce planning and one on HR analytics. Both have an interactive case where people go through the process of strategic workforce planning or HR analytics. And do not forget to train your own team. Again, we learn a lot by summits, social media and reading the latest books and last year we decided to attend some lectures on data mining and algorithms. This keeps us alert and equipped for the analytical challenges to come.</p>, <p><strong>Closing thoughts. </strong>Our lessons learned are in no way an attempt to be complete on what is important in HR analytics. But I hope it provides you with some insights based on our experience in the last year. And again, HR analytics is developing in a fast pace, so who knows how the 10 golden rules of HR analytics will look like next year?</p>, <p>Special thanks to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/auke-ijsselstein/5/605/818"" target=""_blank"">Auke IJsselstein</a> for his contribution to this article and setting up HR analytics in our organisation.

The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,Three ‘Laws’ of Workforce Analytics,8. Amit Mohindra | Three ‘Laws’ of Workforce Analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-laws-workforce-analytics-amit-mohindra?trk=prof-post,"[<p><em>(These are personal views and do not reflect the views, programs or policies of any organization)</em></p>, <p>I’ve distilled what I’ve learnt as the head of Workforce Intelligence at McKesson for the last three years into three principles. I’ve presented these principles at a number of workforce planning and analytics conferences across the U.S. in the last year and the audience’s positive reception emboldens me to call them “laws.” </p>, <p>However, since human capital analytics is a young field, I’ll leave the quotation marks in for now and await the evidence of your experiences to see if we can one day dispense with them.</p>, <p>Whenever my team delivers interesting business insights through workforce analytics, we typically leave the meeting with requests for additional analyses. This is the case whether people are new to workforce analytics or have had previous exposure to analytics. In the first instance, the response is “Wow, who knew? Show us more!” and in the second, it is a more targeted request, reflecting a sophistication about what specifically to look for next.</p>, <p>In either situation, it is not a request for marginally more information or analyses; it is a request for a whole lot more – an exponential increase, relative to what was shared initially. I can’t help but make the connection to Moore’s Law, posited by Gordon Moore, founder of Intel – 50 years ago to the day –  which, simply stated in its current form, says that computing power doubles every 18 months*. The law has withstood the test of time, hence the absence of quotation marks.</p>, <p>One of the main implications of the first “law” is that you have to factor in the exponentially increasing demand to build a right-sized supporting infrastructure. You must ensure that you grow the analytics team at the right pace – don’t forget to make the technology and headcount budget requests early and often!</p>, <p>If you believe all the hype around workforce analytics, you can be forgiven for assuming that once workforce analytics are delivered – via a fabulous report, marvelous dashboard, dot-connecting “story” or some such device – all your problems will be solved. The wonderful “insight” that everyone talks about (the “aha” moment!) will be magically revealed and you will immediately “add value” to “the business.”</p>, <p>The incredible effort needed to develop data assets, tools and analytics notwithstanding, the delivery of the analytics is when the hard work truly begins. One of the secrets to success in analytics is that you need to have a prior expectation of what the number(s) ought to be – that’s the first piece of effort before any analytics are performed – so that you can be an intelligent consumer. Then you have to cast the net wider for additional information, drill deeper to understand drivers, make connections to other insights, adjust hypotheses based on new information, etc.</p>, <p>The implication of the second “law” is that consumers need to have the time to make use of the analytics. This is related to the “energy balance"" implication of the First Law of Thermodynamics. If HR leaders and business partners need to leverage analytics as strategic advisers to the business, they will have to spend less time doing something else. It won’t all just come together without having to lift a finger; there’s no such thing as a free lunch (which someone needs to bank as an Iron Law of Economics).</p>, <p>This is the only one of my “laws” that has a qualifier. I need to insert the qualifier because I’ve seen the “promised land” where workforce planning** works – for the finance and investment banking divisions of a major Wall Street firm in the late 90s and, more recently, for a specialty health care business of a major drug distributor – and truly believe that with the right conditions it can be a game changer for an organization.</p>, <p>What are the right conditions? Most importantly, visionary and strong HR and Finance leaders willing to let down their guard and collaborate so that each can do their job better and jointly improve business outcomes as a result – forecast talent need, manage workforce cost and minimize business strategy execution risk. Other conditions include an existing strategic planning foundation, functional cost- and managerial hierarchy management, an affinity for data and measurement, a talent management system that tracks roles and skills, a disciplined process orientation within HR, and the patience to invest for the long term.</p>, <p>The sad truth is that these conditions are seldom met and we are stuck in the land of the second best. However, that’s where analytics comes to the rescue. In the last two years, I have grown increasingly convinced that you can achieve the <em>outcomes</em> of workforce planning (see the definition below) through workforce analytics without all the pain and pretense that goes with it. This is a variation on modern economists’ recognition that the “invisible hand” of the free market is much better at resource allocation than a planning-based command economy.</p>, <p>The trick is to provide relevant information and insights to human capital decision makers – whether HR leaders, HR business partners, business leaders or people managers – who are closest to the action. This means people in business units who understand the business economics and have the local context, rather than “central planners” at Corporate. As long as the decision makers are incented appropriately through reward systems aligned with business and talent strategies, their analytics-based decisions on people and teams will ensure that the organization has the right person with the right skills in the right place with the right terms at the right time.</p>, <p>In honor of my association with McKesson, I would like to invoke some alliterative allusions and name these three “laws” the <strong>Mohindra-McKesson “Laws” of Workforce Analytics</strong>. This should auger well for the dropping of the quotation marks since the Modigliani-Miller Theorem and the Michelson-Morley Experiments yielded Nobel prizes for three of the four individuals associated with them.</p>, <p>* Moore’s original observation on April 19, 1965 was that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every year since the invention of the integrated circuit. He predicted that this trend would continue for the foreseeable future. The pace declined in later years such that data density has doubled approximately every 18 months. This is the current definition of Moore's Law, blessed by Gordon Moore himself.</p>, <p>** At McKesson we define workforce planning as a <em>business</em> process that applies the <em>rigor</em> of financial planning and analysis to optimize the workforce on three fronts – <em>capacity</em> (headcount size and cost); <em>mix</em> (worker type and location); and <em>capability</em> (skills and experience) – to execute the organization’s business <em>strategy</em>.</p>]"
The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,How we built Talent Analytics at LinkedIn,9. Lorenzo Canlas | How we built Talent Analytics at LinkedIn,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-built-talent-analytics-linkedin-lorenzo-canlas?trk=prof-post,"[<p>Recently at LinkedIn’s annual <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/events/talent-connect"" target=""_blank"">Talent Connect</a> conference, I had the opportunity to share our experiences building a Talent Analytics team. Our team’s purpose is to help our leaders make evidence-based talent decisions that enable LinkedIn to achieve its vision and mission. Considering LinkedIn’s mission is to connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful, it is important that we do that for our own employees.</p>, <p>We started the Talent Analytics team at LinkedIn 24 months ago, and I joined as the team leader six months later. As anyone who works in HR knows, getting started in talent analytics is not easy. When we began, we transferred a few analysts from talent acquisition operations to form a center of excellence in our Business Operations &amp; Analytics department. Our two analysts were completely overwhelmed with reporting requests. We had no capacity to build automated dashboards or do advanced analytics.</p>, <p>We understand that many companies face similar challenges. LinkedIn data show that there are over 5,000 companies with Talent Analytics employees on LinkedIn. Over 70% of these companies have only 1-2 people.</p>, <p><strong>Leapfrogging the maturity curve</strong></p>, <p>HR data are messy. When we first started, business demand for operational data was more than we could satisfy. Every report took much longer than expected because of all the data cleaning. We concluded that no matter how many resources we added, with our current operating model, we would never move up the maturity curve.</p>, <p>What we arrived at is what we internally called a leapfrog approach. Basically this means we did not wait to complete the 2+ year journey to centralize our data before we focused on business impact. Instead, we took a number of actions:</p>, <p>Our resource allocation looks like:</p>, <p>During our first year, managing demand for operational reporting was the biggest challenge. However, as we provided data-driven insights to the business, the demand from executives for analytical work grew. Our focus on business challenges allowed us to build credibility with business leaders. Our transition from reporting to analytics required a lot of tops down support from our CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patwadors"" target=""_blank"">Pat Wadors</a>, VP of Talent Acquisition <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanbrowne"" target=""_blank"">Brendan Browne</a>, and the rest of the HR leadership team. Their commitment is what allowed us to prioritize our work and invest in team resources.</p>, <p>The result of our leapfrog strategy is that our maturity development has not been linear. At the same time, we are always working on some combination of manual reporting, automated dashboards, and predictive modeling.</p>, <p><strong>The way we work</strong></p>, <p>We have observed that commonly, companies will separate reporting, dashboards, and analytics into different teams. One unique aspect of our current team is everyone does some combination of all three activities. It does not matter if you are a management consultant, IO psychologist, or data geek, everyone on our team learns to run regression in R, build a Tableau dashboard, and partner with the business.</p>, <p>Although our approach sometimes puts people out of their comfort zones, the advantage is our HR partners do not always differentiate a reporting, dashboard or analytics request. Providing a single point of contact allows us to iteratively frame what is needed to solve a business problem. Our generalist approach requires our team members to be more agile thinkers and grow skills they never imagined they needed. Seeing my team develop and helping them be successful inspires me every day.</p>, <p><strong>Build vs. buy</strong></p>, <p>Every talent analytics team must make a critical build vs. buy decision on where to store HR data. To achieve our vision, we decided to build our own HR data warehouse and work with a variety of partners for data visualization and analytics. This decision was based on our need to merge data from multiple HR and finance systems with internal data that we would never share with a vendor. That said our approach has required a huge time commitment from the analytics team. Even in our second year of existence, data quality is still our biggest challenge and opportunity.</p>, <p><strong>What it takes to make an impact</strong></p>, <p>Our team’s vision is to make talent a competitive differentiator for LinkedIn. We have purposely taken the approach of not focusing purely on predictive analytics. There are many instances where descriptive data are most effective in providing the fact base to make data-driven decisions. Our impact has not been limited by our analytical capability, but our maturity in partnering with HR to implement specific talent interventions that influence business decisions and behaviors.</p>, <p><strong>Tell me about a time when you influenced a decision with talent data?</strong></p>, <p>We get asked this frequently. That will be the subject of our next posts. In the meantime… we would love to hear from our peers. How have you grown your Talent Analytics team? How have you influenced business decisions? What was the business impact?</p>]"
The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,Is Your Analytics Predictive and Prescriptive?,10. Thomas Hedegaard Rasmussen | Is Your Analytics Predictive and Prescriptive?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-analytics-predictive-prescriptive-thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen,"[<p>Here is why it really does not matter: Analytics is about inferring causality by using scientific methods and statistics - i.e. identifying what works, what drives outcomes, how big is the effect? The 'Predictive' or 'Prescriptive' part is about applying common sense and actually acting on the knowledge derived by Analytics - it is not about more sophisticated statistics or additional analytics. So if someone gives you a pitch on the difference between analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics, odds are that they either:</p>, <p>The analogy is the weather forecast: Science has established the causal relationships between air humidity, air temperature, and when it rains (there is even a simple formula for this) - this is the Analytics: air at a certain temperature can hold a certain amount of water, warmer air can hold more water, so if the temperature drops, it starts raining. Here is the Predictive part:</p>, <p>And here is the prescriptive part - i.e. what to do about it:</p>, <p>Here an example for HR Analytics, e.g. establishing that Leadership drives Employee Engagement and Motivation which in turn drives better Safety Performance (lower Total Recorded Incident Frequency, TRCF). You infer causality - i.e. that one thing actually drives another - by applying the right research design - typically a longitudinal research design, i.e. you study something over time (and rule out other possible explanations, reverse causality etc.). Once causality is established, you e.g. see from your yearly Engagement Survey that Employee Engagement drops in a certain part of your organization - you then get 'Predictive' and infer: this may increase the number of safety incidents. And as a next step you get 'Prescriptive': lets identify those leaders that need help to improve Engagement of their teams and provide extra support.</p>, <p>So what you really need is science to infer causality (Analytics) - to get evidence for 'what works', but being 'predictive' and 'prescriptive' is actually about common sense, and acting on your knowledge - and not about more advanced analytics and spiffy IT. Analytics is just means to an end; providing input to leadership discussions and decision making - but you still need your common sense, experience, and intuition to be predictive and prescriptive - and as you know, if you don't act on your analytics, it brings no value. And the other important thing to know? Establishing the facts in HR (what is our turnover rate? female representation in senior leadership? FTE? age distribution of our workforce? etc.) - that is called Management Information &amp; Reporting - it is very valuable as is enables fact based discussions - but it is not Analytics if it does not establish the causal link to a non HR outcome (e.g. Leadership drives Safety Performance).      </p>]"
The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,Seven deadly sins to avoid with HR Analytics initiatives,11. Mark Berry |,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/seven-deadly-sins-avoid-hr-analytics-initiatives-mark-berry?trk=hp-feed-article-title-like,"[<p>""Sin""?  What does that have to do with HR analytics initiatives?  And a quote from an obscure play (""Measure for Measure"") by William Shakespeare?  Bear with me while I elaborate...</p>, <p>The right HR leader can play a vital role in enabling workforce analytics initiatives. Effective sponsorship will ensure that an analytics initiative has the support required to succeed, the resources – both people &amp; technology – to be impactful, the support to create &amp; communicate a clear, compelling vision, and the leeway to focus its attention on key business challenges or issues.</p>, <p>Conversely, the wrong HR leader can help to kill a talent analytics initiative before its first breath. With the best of intentions, a misguided leader will – intentionally or not – engage in behaviors that virtually guarantee the failure (or significantly impeded the traction) of future workforce analytics initiatives. In some cases, these errors are committed with the best of intentions. In other cases, good intentions are not the issue, but rather ignorance, naivety, or hubris (or a combination of the three) play a role.</p>, <p>If you – as a HR leader – want to really support your organization’s HR analytics efforts, there are specific behaviors – “sins”, if you will – you should seek to avoid. Granted, “sin” may be a strong word, but – hey – it got your attention and may have influenced you to read this! However, these are dynamics that – if you can avoid them – will help set up your workforce analytics initiatives for success.</p>, <p>So, in no particular order, here are seven ""sins"" that can surely make analytics initiatives more difficult (or set the stage for failure at inception):</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>“Burger King” – Having It Your Way</strong></p>, <p>This is one of the most common issues – a senior leader decides that analytics is <br/>going to support their “vision” – which (unfortunately) is often no more than a better way to see my “dashboard” or “scorecard” or to demonstrate that, “I’m doing what I said I’ve been doing (or – actually – “Others are doing what I said I was doing”). It’s not about measuring the most relevant people-focused business drivers, but rather providing a more technologically sophisticated “veneer” on their “pet” metric, report, scorecard, or dashboard.</p>, <p>Compounding this is the leader who can’t fix on a given objective or set of objectives, but instead change their “order” as one might change what they order from one trip to Burger King to another. They start out with no vision regarding what they want and then – in the absence of any clear vision – their interests shift from one metric to the next ad nauseum (based on the last conference they attended or article they read). Those who are lovers of the “Burger King” approach to analytics don’t want insights necessarily; as much as anything, they’re good with whatever they have a whim to measure at any given time.  It's about ""cool"" and ""contemporary"", not ""compelling"".  Unfortunately, in attempting to simply re-create what they already have or changing what they want at whim, they stifle the ability of their HR analytics’ team to deliver strategically significant insights.</p>, <p>“Teacher’s Pet” is quite similar to the preceding characteristic. The difference – it’s focused on furthering a specific agenda. Most commonly, you see this in the HR leader who supports analytics in order to “prove” or “validate” that their favorite pet project is yielding the promised results.</p>, <p>HR analytics can also be hijacked by the leader who is seeking to show others where there are deficiencies in the organization (rarely or never their own) – or in those of other leaders. In this case, it’s all about “analytics by vendetta” – with the focus being shining the light on a colleague’s people issues, not only providing compelling, enterprise-relevant insights about their people.</p>, <p>Either approach (“proving” the value of ‘pet’ projects or “torpedoing” an adversary’s efforts) is detrimental to the efforts of your workforce analytics initiative.  How?  Nothing kills the credibility of workforce analytics faster than it being perceived as an “arm” of a self-promoting leader.</p>, <p>This is most commonly observed with leaders who attempt to initiate analytics programs by requiring that their team use inadequate technology. It’s not that workforce analytics initiatives require necessarily require significant investments. However, there is – in most cases – incremental investments, whether they are people or technology-related.</p>, <p>This is often most apparent in organizations where a senior HR leader will not support any incremental investments, requiring the workforce analytics leader to beg, borrow, or – God forbid – steal the resources necessary. Ironically, the converse of this - over-investment without clarity &amp; specificity regarding focus &amp; outcomes - can be equally damnable, putting undue pressure to deliver with no clear expectations with respect to impact.  Fortunately, this is a far less common variant of the ""sin"" of ""penny wise"".  Bottom line: if you don’t have confidence (or clarity of purpose) in the value of the initiative and don’t want to risk any of your own financial – or political – capital (or are open to risk much with no clearly defined outcomes), stop, take stock of your motivations, and do what is right.  Remember, CHROs - you get what you pay for - don't ask your HR analytics leader to be an alchemist (creating something out of nothing) as well as an analyst.  It never works.</p>, <p>This is very similar to “Penny Wise”; the primary difference being that leaders who embrace “headcount neutrality” – deliberately or otherwise – put analytics in a “no win” situation, competing for limited resources (people, dollars, technology, etc.) with their peers (who are – like HR analytics – competing for limited resources &amp; their own survival).</p>, <p>These leaders place their HR analytics initiatives in sort of a “Hobson’s choice”. Named after Thomas Hobson (a 16th century British livery stable owner known for his practice of offering customers the choice of either taking the horse in the stall nearest the door - as a means of rotating the use of the horse - or none at all), a “Hobson’s choice” is a free choice in which only one option is offered. As a person may refuse to take that option, the choice is therefore between taking the option or not. In plain English, it’s a form of “take it or leave it”.</p>, <p>Leaders who use this approach may – erroneously – believe that they are being good stewards of their organization’s budget. However, what they are – in fact – doing is pitting their HR analytics initiative against all others seeking the same source of funding. </p>, <p>In many cases, this is also related to a dynamic described above – the leader doesn’t appreciate the potential value of their analytics investment (and are – in effect – looking to get something for nothing). The problem – in a nutshell – is that what they often get is just that – nothing. Or they get very little in the way of progress because they’re not willing to allow a team member to focus their efforts on the opportunity.</p>, <p>Granted, this isn’t always bad, per se. In some cases, this approach can be a great way to start – in part, because it makes the ROI so attractive. Also, for the part-time analytics leader, he/she has very little pressure to produce – because the expectation to deliver is - hopefully - so low.</p>, <p>As with many things in life, in the long run, this approach is doomed to fail.  For the past six years, I've run ultra marathons (races of distances greater than 26.2 miles).  When preparing for an ""ultra"", I would generally run 50-100 miles per week for a number of weeks in advance of an event.  However, a few years back, I incurred a running-related injury that rendered me unable to run any distances in the months prior to a race.  However, I was able to participate in high intensity interval training (intense combination of weight training &amp; cardio workouts).  But I wasn't able to log the running I needed to be success.  Guess what happened?  In my next 100 mile race, I started out strong, only to fade (actually, I found myself falling asleep while walking and running the last 7-8 miles) and drop from the race after 92 miles.  My inability to commit cost me; in a 100 mile race, completing any distance less than 100 mile is not a ""finish"", but rather a ""failure"".  Lesson learned: If you expect to succeed in something as challenging as HR analytics (or running 100 miles), you must commit to the task.  There are no short-cuts or alternatives.  It's an ""all in"" commitment.  </p>, <p>For those leaders truly committed to HR analytics and desirous of timely, impactful results, anything other than ""all in"" is rarely the best way to go.  But many will still choose to do so - and ""fail"".  </p>, <p>It seems to be increasingly common that HR analytics is assigned to report to a vice president of talent, organizational effectiveness, or some other function. In theory, it makes sense on some level; the assumption is that HR analytics is an “centers of expertise”, as is staffing, compensation, benefits, and other functions.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, the assumption that HR analytics is just another “CoE” is flawed. It is a capability possessed by very few HR organizations (unlike staffing, compensation, benefits, etc) and with good reason – it requires a specialized set of knowledge, skills, and abilities.  Rightly executed, it can be strategically powerful - providing HR leadership with a means to identify opportunities and evaluate the impact of current HR investments.</p>, <p>That is why I find it so bewildering that CHROs will so often cede HR analytics to an ""underling"" in talent, organizational effectiveness, or some other function within HR.  As a CHRO, I look at HR analytics as a key component of our organization's HR strategy and an enabler to drive true ""evidence-based"" HR practices.  I want my analytics resources to be - in some way - ""autonomous"" from undue influence of other CoE leaders, but instead free to focus their efforts to truly evaluating the impact of the work of those CoEs.  That requires a level of ""independence"" - somewhat akin to how organizations will segregate reporting of their internal audit organizations.  To me, HR analytics requires that same level of ""independence"" and ""autonomy"". </p>, <p>Second, CHROs must not only attract, hire, and enable HR analytics leaders, but must take a greater level of ""ownership"" with respect to the work of analytics in their respective organization.  Today's senior HR leader must understand the capabilities and limitations of analytics, understand how to leverage these to identify future opportunities &amp; evaluate the impact of current investments.  They should not trust this to another to ""oversee"", but instead look at HR analytics in much the same way as they view compensation, benefits, and other CoE - something of such great significance (or potential significance) that it must report to them directly.  Ceding this to someone else diminishes this - and will render many of those organizations incapable of attracting talent at the level they need to derive maximum benefit from their analytics investment.</p>, <p>Trust me – it is a rare “less analytically inclined” HR leader who can effectively advocate for &amp; support a HR analytics initiative of any size, scale, or complexity. That ""layer"" between the CHRO and HR analytics leader rarely serves any benefit to the CHRO, organization, or effort.  I’ve tried it. I’d never do it again. Life is too short. I’ll leave it at that.</p>, <p>An extension of the preceding “sin”, “know it all” HR leaders (who are often also “less analytically inclined”) take upon themselves the role of “selling” HR analytics to others within the HR organization and the company as a whole. Unfortunately, lacking a background in analytics, scientific methodology, or research methods, it is the rare non-analytics HR leader who is equipped to do so.</p>, <p>I understand why a CHRO or other HR leader in an organization would want to do this; I - for one - always relish being the first one in the office with a new theory, tool, or toy.  With HR analytics, as a HR leader, I want to be the person in the room with compelling fact-based insights about our people - it can provide value (in the right context) to the organization and burnish my reputation as a great HR leader.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, few CHROs or senior HR leaders have the capability to effectively articulate HR analytics findings.  They often lack an appreciation or knowledge of scientific method, statistical power, and nuances inherent within the analysis that's been done.  As a result, misstatements and mischaracterizations are common - and can kill the credibility of both the leader &amp; the organization's HR analytics initiative.  Trust me, there's nothing worse than sitting in a meeting of a company's senior leaders when your CHRO or senior HR leader misrepresents the findings of a study or the capabilities of the team.  Does the analytics leader sit &amp; say nothing (the ""safe"" thing in terms of short-term politics) or attempt to correct the senior leader's error (a much less ""safe""thing to do)?  </p>, <p>Given the propensity for misrepresentation, one would think that CHROs or other senior HR leaders would want their HR analytics leader in the room. Unfortunately, this is often not the case.  When “less analytically inclined” HR leaders who are also insecure in allowing members of the HR analytics team to represent the work done by the analytics team to other leaders, these issues only become more apparent - and put the efforts of the analytics team at risk, as they are being voiced by someone who can’t begin to form complete sentences with respect to the work being done, not to mention explaining the nuances of the projects undertaken.</p>, <p>Simple summary - ""Selling"" of HR analytics is best done by those who understand the ""what"", ""why"", and ""how"" that went into the work, not by another leader.  There are those rare occasions when the CHRO has that level of knowledge, but in the absence of that, leave the selling to those who understand best what has been done.</p>, <p>Hopefully, I’ve been able to shine a light on some of the “sins” prevalent in the field of HR analytics. If – in looking in the mirror – you see a “sinner” staring back at you, there is only one true option: Repent! Recognize the error of your ways, seek to make right your wrongs, and put your feet on the path leading to what is good and proper. HR analytics initiatives – not plagued by these “sins” – can provide strategically significant, sustainable competitive advantage. Don’t allow yourself to become (or continue to be) ensnared in the errors of these sins.</p>, <p>Now, go forth and sin no more.    </p>]"

The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,Clear Storytelling Boosts Value of Analytics,15. Tom Davenport |,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/clear-storytelling-boosts-value-analytics-tom-davenport?trk=hp-feed-article-title-comment,"[<p>The goal of analytics is usually to inform a decision made by humans. And to persuade those humans to make a decision on the basis of analytical results, you will often have to tell a good story. Many companies are realizing that good analytics means good storytelling. One way to do that is to train quantitative types to tell a good story, but that can be a difficult slog. A company can also meet its storytelling needs for analytics by engaging with specialists—either humans or machines—to work with the quants and tell a good story about their analysis.</p>, <p>Let’s start with the human storytellers, because on the whole I believe they will do a better job of telling analytics-based tales, at least for now. There is, of course, a human profession that specializes in storytelling—it’s called journalism. And you may have heard that there are plenty of them available for hire these days.</p>, <p>But I have only heard of one analytics leader who has hired a journalist to leverage the storytelling efforts of quantitative analysts. That person is Dr. Pamela Peele, the Chief Analytics Officer of UPMC’s Insurance Services business unit. UPMC—previously known as the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center—is a large health-care provider with its own health plan organization.</p>, <p>Ms. Peele’s own story is that she came to UPMC about eight years ago, and with backing from her organization created a serious analytics capability. Her analytics group is an interdisciplinary team of about 25 analysts and data scientists that assesses new models and programs for delivering and financing high-quality health care. Some have Ph.D.’s in quantitative fields. They’re a crack group of quantitative modelers.</p>, <p>Those credentials do not, however, make them great storytellers. Ms. Peele noticed several years ago that the team was making great progress at creating new knowledge from data and analytics, but wasn’t having the impact on organizational initiatives and policies that she had hoped. “We were just flinging out the insights so fast that people just couldn’t consume them,” she noted. “And when you have a statistician write a report, it may not be fit for consumption by C-suite executives.”</p>, <p>So a few years ago Ms. Peele hired someone with a journalism background, primarily to write clearly and in plain language about what her group’s analysts discovered.</p>, <p>A primary focus of the analyses was program evaluation—what outcomes result from new care or financing programs. The goal was never to “spin” the research. Ms. Peale stated emphatically that, “We put out seriously good analysis with no agenda. My job is to find out and publish the truth.“ But Ms. Peele felt that telling good stories was a way to help executives consume that truth in an understandable form. As she noted on an IBM site featuring her work, “We have a finite amount of attention in a world of massively increasing information. The challenge for big data is to not only produce new information but to weave information together to make it attention-worthy.”</p>, <p>The journalist Ms. Peele hired, who has been succeeded by another talented writer with a background in policy research and English, helped to reduce the statistical jargon and improve the clarity of the stories behind the statistics. Ms. Peele argues, “We needed to stand up a storyboard, but we don’t need to tell our audiences the p-values” [probabilities of non-random outcomes in statistical analysis].</p>, <p>Ms. Peele’s group of quantitative analysts was initially puzzled about why she would devote a precious job in the group to telling stories. Now, however, they like the role because it excuses them from having to draft the reports. The analysts do the design and analysis, but it’s the storyteller’s job to get the analyst to tell them the story. The writer elicits the main points and how they will impact the organization. “The storyteller’s job,” Ms. Peele says, “is to start at the end and only provide technical detail when absolutely necessary.</p>, <p>For those who don’t want to hire a professional human storyteller, it also may work to employ an automated journalist to tell stories about data. Increasing numbers of organizations are adopting this approach for straightforward, data-intensive topics and analyses. The Associated Press, for example, uses software from Automated Insights to produce sports stories and corporate earnings reports. The same software is used by digital marketing agencies to tell their clients stories about recent Web analytics results. Several financial firms use automated writing tools from another company, Narrative Science to produce short investment reports. Automated storytelling is fast, of course, and the AP says it has dramatically reduced the number of errors in its earnings reports. And in many cases it is difficult to distinguish between the human-written story and that produced by a machine.</p>, <p>Of course, such automated storytelling systems may be challenged to accurately describe a complex analytical story in the necessary detail, or to provide the needed organizational context. But it points to the likelihood that more stories will be told by machines in the future. And whether your analytical stories are told by human or machine, the key is to recognize the importance of simple and clear storytelling in the communication of quantitative analysis. Like Dr. Pamela Peele, analytics executives need to focus just as much on the successful consumption of analytics as the generation of them—and stories are key to accomplishing that objective.</p>, <p><em>Thomas H.

The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,People Analytics – it’s a mug’s game. Isn’t it?,16. Sam Hill |,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-its-mugs-game-isnt-sam-hill?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p><strong>People Analytics – it’s a mug's game. Isn’t it?</strong></p>, <p>Or how the People Analyst can learn much about Predictive Analytics from the discipline of a professional gambler.</p>, <p>I struck my first bet in April 1987 – Maori Venture to win the Grand National; I overheard someone mention it favoured heavy ground (mud, essentially) and, as there was rain in the air…. well it won at handsome odds of 28/1.</p>, <p>I didn’t examine the ‘form’, I was essentially clueless - I just got lucky. Not that I accepted this at the time – this particular truth presented itself three months later once I’d lost my winnings and a whole lot more besides. But it was fun while it lasted.</p>, <p>What wasn’t so enjoyable was being told by a procession of wise old sages that it was a 'mug's game' – unfortunately, in my case, they were spot on.</p>, <p>However, further research revealed this not to be a universal truth. For sure most bookies win over time, and most ‘punters’ lose eventually – but there are winners too, predominately those who are disciplined in their approach and seek out value.</p>, <p>And here I’m suggesting parallels with quality People Analytics practitioners – disagree if you will, but it’s only a minority (less than 10%?) who consistently derive value from their endeavours.</p>, <p>So what are these parallels between a Professional Gambler and the Quality People Analytics Practitioner? Broadly they share <strong>three common characteristics:</strong></p>, <p><strong>1  They do their research</strong></p>, <p>The Professional Gambler studies the form; results from past races, cross-referenced against handicaps, distance, effect of the draw; they have access to, understand and analyse any information that may contribute to the unearthing of a value bet</p>, <p>The People Analyst gathers and scrutinises information relating to the workforce’s capability, behaviour and configuration, data from tradition HR sources and secondary data relating to workforce performance and attitudes; anything that may link the workforce to, and can be influenced to improve, business performance</p>, <p><strong>2  They cultivate and maintain relationships</strong> </p>, <p>The Professional Gambler will, as best they can, build a rapport with jockeys, trainers, stable staff, breeders and the press – anybody who can provide ‘inside information’ that may provide a steer in the direction of that informed punt</p>, <p>The People Analyst will keep formal and informal channels of communication open with HR process owners, line managers, senior managers, HR Business Partners and potentially external stakeholders to measure the pulse of their organisation and to identify emerging workforce issues or opportunities</p>, <p><strong>3  They invest only where significant ROI is most likely</strong></p>, <p>Once the Professional Gambler has shaped an informed opinion, available betting bank funds are considered, and these are invested proportionately against a combination of success probability and potential profit; there is awareness that a value bet doesn’t always equate to a winning bet, and therefore all eggs are not placed in a single basket, however there is an unshakable confidence that a succession of value bets will provide a return in the long run</p>, <p>Once the People Analyst has considered both quantitative and qualitative inputs, a shortlist of potentially insightful investigations is drawn up and prioritised to ensure that available resources can be used in the most effective manner; there is an acceptance that a hypothesis may be proved ‘false’, but recognition that this outcome may also provide value</p>, <p> <strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>, <p>Resources are finite, invest only in analytical investigations that have the potential to provide value to business decision making.</p>, <p>Planning to simply dive into the (‘Big’) data in the hope of coming up clutching insight? Well, that is a mug's game – have fun while it lasts.</p>, <p><strong>Sam Hill</strong> is Managing Consultant and Founder of <strong>Workforce Dimensions</strong> who partner with organisations seeking to understand and maximise the contribution their people make to business imperatives.</p>, <p>Workforce Dimensions provides advisory and educational services exclusively in the field of Strategic Workforce Planning and Analytics</p>, <p> <a href=""http://www.workforcedimensions.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.workforcedimensions.co.uk</a></p>, <p> <a rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">sam.hill@workforcedimensions.co.uk</a></p>, <p> Twitter: @sam_hill_wfd</p>]"

The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,The Ethics of Analytics: A Look into the Dark Side,19. Tracey Smith | The Ethics of Analytics: A Look into the Dark Side,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ethics-analytics-look-dark-side-tracey-smith?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>In my profession, I get to meet a lot of people around the globe and hear a great deal of stories. This article is dedicated to the darker side of analytics and the ethical decisions associated with it.</p>, <p><strong>Ethics of Consultants</strong></p>, <p>The first topic that I’ll introduce is one that appeared on social media and involves the analytics consulting industry. For those conducting predictive analytics, we consultants were split on our ethical duty to explain to our clients what those predictions mean. I will always remain in the camp that says I have a duty to explain to my customers that predictive analytics are based on statistics, statistics are based on probability, and therefore any prediction is a likely outcome not a guaranteed outcome.</p>, <p>Another camp of consultants essentially maintains that they do not need to explain this to their customers because the statistical definition of predictive analytics makes that clear. I don’t expect my customers to know statistical definitions. I am there to help them understand what these analytical studies really mean for their business and to ensure they understand the risks associated with certain business decisions made with the results.</p>, <p>For those consultants reading this article, let’s not go through the same posting of comments again. We’ve already had that discussion and that’s not the point of this article.</p>, <p><strong>Ethics of Corporate Leaders</strong></p>, <p>A second topic of darkness is one that comes from within corporations. As companies build their HR Analytics (HRA) functions, a few HRA leaders have been asked to use their data to prove that a certain leader’s programs are successful rather than “letting the data drive the decisions” through impartial analysis. These are companies that don’t wish to hear the truth of what’s working and what isn’t inside HR. For the ethical HRA leader, this is a difficult spot in which to be. I applaud those that have left this situation in search of more ethical environments. It’s a difficult choice when you still have bills to pay.</p>, <p>What is the end result for these types of companies? What have they accomplished after spending money to implement HR Analytics? They don’t act on information that shows them certain HR initiatives aren’t yielding value. This means they will continue to fund programs that don’t produce an ROI. In short, they are in the exact same position that they were in BEFORE implementing HR Analytics, but now they have the cost of implementation and maintenance of the function.</p>, <p>Hundreds of companies are on an ethical journey into HR Analytics and many consultants with high ethics are there to support them. It’s the stories from the “dark side” that taint the profession and demote the value of what we do and what we are trying to accomplish.</p>, <p>Until next time,<br/>                               Tracey. </p>, <p><em>Tracey is an expert in analytics and continuous improvement and presents at conferences in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. She holds degrees in Mathematics, Engineering and Business and has over 25 years of experience in the areas of Human Resources, Supply Chain and Engineering.

Manoj Kumar – Why investors/CEOs are not yet talking about Human Capital performance as much as they do about financial capital,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-investorsceos-yet-talking-human-capital-much-do-financial-kumar?trk=prof-post,"[<p>************ No time to read, listen this article <a href=""http://app.wachak.com/article/3"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> ***************</p>, <p>A month ago I attended a round-table discussion in London comprising investors, Human Capital Analytics industry experts, Human Resource practitioners and few C-suite members. The learning from the conversation was immense - investors current mindset, why Human capital measurement is not must-to-have yet, what would they like to see from companies/startups and more importantly what can CEOs/CHROs do to create an appetite for Human Capital in their mind.</p>, <p>Let's take a quick look at an industry research on investment pattern in intangible assets.  <a href=""https://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/1402_working_paper_-_uk_investment_in_intangible_assets_report_for_nesta.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Research by NESTA </a>(Goodridge et al. 2014) estimates that between 1990 and 2011, the value of intangible assets in the UK grew from £50.2 billion to £137.5 billion, while at the same time the value of tangible, physical assets has increased much more slowly from £72.1 billion to £89.8 billion. Workforce training (£33.6bn); organizational change (£25.5bn); and software (£24.3bn) are the most sought categories in the intangible investment in 2011.</p>, <p>From the above research, the importance of intangible assets is evident, especially in the knowledge economy. However, investors are not yet asking for Human Capital performance report as much as they do for Finance Capital. Alternatively, why CEOs/founders are yet not telling their Human Capital performance story proactively as much as they show Financial results.  Why? There are two key problems:</p>, <p>As a CEO of the company/startup, if you want to demonstrate the value of your Human Capital as an asset to your investors, you need to do the following:</p>, <p><strong>Push the Information:</strong> All the Human Capital story should be pushed and be seen as one of the competitive advantages of your organization. The more you help them understand the Human Capital value (push), the more investment your organization will attract.</p>, <p> <strong>Human Capital Statement in Annual Report:</strong> Create a detailed Human Capital Statement section in the annual report, similar to the Finance Capital Statement. The KPIs under Human Capital statement of the company should be well thought through, agreed, measured and not limited to reporting Headcount, diversity, Attrition and cost of staff etc. only. However, in the absence of availability of sophisticated KPIs measurements, above KPIs could be a good starting point.</p>, <p><strong>Content</strong><strong> is the King (Value):</strong> The key Human Capital metrics that investors may be interested in learning includes</p>, <p> (1) Leadership Index i.e. ability to cope with changing economic situation &amp; fierce competition and execute strategy of the organization </p>, <p>(2) Culture &amp; values index i.e. ability to demonstrate brand &amp; reputation of the company to attract &amp; retain talent, customers &amp; investors </p>, <p>(3) Learning &amp; Development i.e. workforce planning - Buy vs Build - what gives confidence to investor that company talent is future ready or have a strategy in place? and </p>, <p>(4) Governance i.e. sustainability of Human Capital). </p>, <p>These are the four Human Capital KPIs your investors would love to see. </p>, <p><strong>Narrative:</strong> Most importantly, investors are interested in learning your inter-connected Human Capital story, not just metrics. You (with your CHRO) should talk your Human Capital performance as passionately as you do for Financial results. The knowledge capital story of your organization is not accessible to anyone else outside of your organization hence treat that as your IP. Your investors want to hear your holistic, interconnected story more often than you think. Publish your data-driven Human Capital story as the competitive advantage.  </p>, <p>So, it is you (CEOs/CHROs) who is needed to change the approach from pull to push to demonstrate the power of Human Capital of your organization. The question that we need to ask ourselves - Are we telling investors right insight-based story enough, that can give confidence in company's capability to produce sustainable profit year over year to our investors. The potential of Human Capital multiplies many folds when tapped, measured and narrated fact based to our stakeholders (internal and external both) and through annual report/investor's update. </p>, <p>How are you dealing with this part of investor conversation in your company/startup? I would be interested in hearing your examples in the comments below.</p>, <p>Thank you for reading my post. I write whenever I stuck on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/posts/manojkumarhranalytics"" target=""_blank"">an idea worth sharing here at Linkedin</a>.</p>, <p>Here are some other recent posts from me:</p>]"
The 27 best HR Analytics articles of H1 2016,The first three skills HR needs to learn from outside HR,10. Tracey Smith – The first three skills HR needs to learn from outside HR,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/first-three-skills-hr-needs-learn-from-outside-tracey-smith?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>Many HR teams struggle to move forward to meet the needs of their CEOs and CFOs. Part of the issue is that HR does not have many of the skills it needs to migrate the HR Business Partner role into what is needed today. These missing skills are not taught in HR university programs, so the responsibility lands in the lap of the corporate world to teach its own employees. </p>, <p>Where should companies start? Below, I have listed the first three skills on which I believe HR should focus. I could list several more such as innovation, but these first three are the ones that “leap out at me” every time I enter an HR team. </p>, <p><strong>Basic Financial Knowledge</strong></p>, <p>How can we expect our HR employees to make good financial decisions or recommendations on the direction of HR programs if we haven’t taught them basic financial skills? If they don’t understand how to read the three basic financial statements (balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement), and understand certain financial metrics, how will they spend their HR budgets to maximize value to the business? How will they “speak the language of the business?” Unless your HR team has several MBAs in it, you will probably benefit from teaching HR about these financials. To date, I have only heard of one company who trained all of their HR staff on this topic. (If your company has, feel free to tell me.) </p>, <p><strong>Project Management</strong> </p>, <p>Having spent the first ten years of my career as a mechanical engineer, project management has become second nature. When my career led me into a Fortune 500’s HR department, I was a Business Strategist and responsible for leading strategic HR projects. It didn’t take long to realize that the members of my teams had little to no project management experience. Previous project leads allowed these projects to drift along and they were almost always behind schedule.</p>, <p>Does this happen with your HR team? Are you always pushing completion dates into the next quarter? </p>, <p>The project management skills I used in HR were by no means the extensive version I used in engineering. I don’t expect HR employees to be versed in PMBOK, the book of knowledge provided by the Project Management Institute. What I did try to teach my HR team members was:</p>, <p>After leading a few projects for this company, I received several comments from the HR leadership about how much they learned from me about project management. At the same time, I was holding 15 minute classes on the use and benefits of SharePoint for sharing project files, communications, etc. instead of using email. Have you had people answer emails that are 5 “versions” old? I used SharePoint for a lot of this to keep everyone up to date “real time” since I had team members in 5 global regions and one high-priority project was moving faster than email could possibly deal with. </p>, <p><strong>Business Acumen</strong> </p>, <p>We’ve spoken of this need many times. HR has traditionally had a very narrow focus and the members of HR have not usually gained any experience outside of HR. Short, rotational assignments or job shadowing would be a great benefit here. Having project team members from outside of HR contribute to HR projects is also a good idea. How can HR have a holistic view of how their choices and changes impact other areas of the company if they only understand how it will affect HR? </p>, <p><strong>In Summary</strong></p>, <p>I think it is a large enough challenge for HR leaders and educators today to create a plan and execute an initiative to develop these three skills in their HR employees. Let’s spur some action in these three topics and put HR on a path to creating more value.</p>, <p>[Note: If you liked this post, you'll probably enjoy the book, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Best-Yet-Come-Expert-Building/dp/1530592240"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>The Best is Yet to Come</strong></a>.]</p>, <p> Until next time, </p>, <p>Tracey. </p>, <p><em>Tracey has been recognized as one of the ""Top 50 Global Influencers in HR Analytics.""

The 27 best HR Analytics articles of H1 2016,The human factor in HR Analytics,13. Patrick Coolen –,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-factor-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST,"[<p>Sometimes people come up to me and say: “Where is the <em>human</em> factor in HR analytics? You can not put a number on everything, in the end we are talking about people, right?” I really think we have to turn that around. I believe that you are forgetting the human factor if you are <em>not</em> applying analytics. Let me explain. </p>, <p>Most people will agree on the fact that analytics is improving decision-making. The combination of your experience and intuition together with the use of advanced analytics will increase the value of your insights. It is the experience and intuition that allows us to focus on the right business question, to interpret the anomalies in the data, to challenge the outcomes of the analyses and to efficiently drive insights into effective action. It is the analytics that allows us to minimise human bias and to discover new relationships in the data that we didn’t think of. </p>, <p><strong>Human bias</strong></p>, <p>Human bias can result, for instance, in not hiring or promoting the ‘right’ candidate for a specific job. Do you think it is ‘fair’ for employees if we reject them for the wrong reasons? Human bias can also result in ‘inefficient’ interventions to maximize employee’s health, engagement or development. Is it ‘fair’ if we send employees to a training program that is not helping them to develop or to be more engaged? In other words, human bias can ‘hurt’ your employees. And do not think that you are immune to human bias. Simply read Kahneman. So if you have an instrument like analytics to minimise human bias, why wouldn’t you use it?</p>, <p><strong>New Insights</strong></p>, <p>On top of that analytics can provide you with new insights, sometimes counter-intuitive, that ‘help’ employees. For instance you might find a relationship between specific working conditions and absenteeism. Or you might find a relationship between team characteristics and employee engagement (and maybe even customer satisfaction). Why would you not try to do everything possible to enable your employees to be as healthy, engaged, effective and productive as possible and help your organization at the same time? </p>, <p>I am not naïve; of course you can misuse analytics only for the benefit of the organization if you want. But <em>misusing </em>analytics is not caused by using advanced statistics or data mining techniques but by the fact that analytics is used for the wrong reason. Ironically it is a ‘human’ that sometimes forgets the human factor, not the ‘analytics’. So when you are serious about the human factor in HR and you are willing to use it for the better of your employees within the boundaries of privacy legislation, you should start implementing analytics right now!<strong> </strong></p>, <p><strong>Creating insights and using insights</strong></p>, <p>In most cases people also think that technical skills and techniques are at the heart of analytics. I disagree. Don’t get me wrong they are important, but creating insights means nothing if your organization will not use them. To my opinion creating insights is the easier part because it is a technique that can be learned or outsourced. Using analytics is much more difficult because this deals with human beings having to understand the possibilities of analytics, accepting unexpected or counter-intuitive study outcomes and having the courage and will to act on it. </p>, <p><em>Creating insights</em> is about applying sophisticated analytical methods like multiple regression, SEM, K-means, Random Forest, K-nearest Neighbour and other data mining techniques. Please do also have a look beyond ‘classical’ statistics and start exploring these data mining techniques. The purpose is to squeeze out as much information as possible out of your data that is relevant to your business question. In the world of HR or people analytics these methods are used on HR datasets combined with business datasets. So for instance analytics can provide insights on the relationship between team dynamics or characteristics and revenue per department.</p>, <p>And again, do not think that data techniques by itself are enough to create insights. You will need the experience and sometimes-even intuition to explain and improve the models. I guess, here as well, some human factor is needed to create the best insights. The insights are in most cases very powerful and valuable but they mean nothing if you cannot turn them into action.</p>, <p><em>Using insights</em> is about your organization accepting new insights, making decisions and acting on them. This all starts with being able to tell a story based on your research. There are many examples where great insights are presented poorly with too many technical details. You basically need some consultancy skills in your team to ‘sell’ the insights to your customer. Use business language, business examples, strong visualizations and keep it simple. </p>, <p>Second, your HR managers and experts should really understand the possibilities of analytics. They are the ones who are having valuable discussions within the business or they are the ones who are developing new HR policies or services. So make sure the power of HR analytics is not only known by your analytical team, but also by the rest of HR and your business. They should be able to recognize the opportunities of analytics for their business.</p>, <p><strong>Demand and supply of analytics</strong></p>, <p>It is going to be very difficult to scale up and improve analytics solely by the efforts of your analytical team. You need ambassadors or translators if you will. Also read “<a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/hello-hr-business-partner-are-you-an-analytics-translator/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR business partner, are you an analytics translator</a>?” by Luk Smeyers. These ambassadors should and will drive demand for analytics in your organization, where your analytical team is responsible for the supply. Demand and supply should preferably not be in synch! Nobody wants a status quo! Your analytical team (supply) should inspire and motivate your organization to use analytics, where your organization should ask for more insights (demands) what will drive the maturity of your analytical team.</p>, <p><strong>Relevant data</strong></p>, <p>Finally HR should start to think in relevant data spots. Are you collecting the right and relevant data to help your employees or your business? Do you have the right measurements of success defined in recruitment, learning and development or for example succession management? Counting your vacancies filled is important, but counting and analyzing your hires that are still engaged and productive after three years really adds value for recruitment and your business. Policy makers and product owners within HR must re-assess their policies and processes on relevant data. This will require some process and data design thinking in HR.<strong> </strong></p>, <p><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></p>, <p>All of the above is about the bigger picture of HR analytics and based on our experience in the last years. It is not only about using advanced techniques. It is also about minimizing human bias, creating new insights, helping employees, using the insights, creating relevant data and creating a high demand for analytics. So the question people should ask to approximately 90% of all organizations is: “Why are you not using analytics?

The 27 best HR Analytics articles of H1 2016,Engagement: Part 1 – Issues with the traditional approach,14. Andrew Marritt –,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/engagement-surveys-part-1-issues-traditional-approach-marritt?trk=pulse_spock-articles,"[<p><em>This is part 1 of a 2 part series. In this part I’m going to focus on some of the issues that we see. Next week I’ll focus on some of the market responses to these issues.</em></p>, <p><em>In these articles I use the term ‘survey’ to mean both a survey, with sampling, and a census where everyone is asked.</em></p>, <p>There is a shift at the moment from long infrequent engagement surveys to shorter, ‘pulse’ surveys which are being used either as a replacement or supplement to the longer survey. With this and the following post I wanted to discuss some of what we see as reasons and advantages and in doing this. As always I hope to give a data-led perspective.</p>, <p><strong>Some background</strong></p>, <p>Organizations, recently through their HR departments but before that via operation research groups, have been conducting employee surveys for around 100 years. In the 1970s the focus was on organization commitment and job satisfaction and the focus went from OR to HR. There had been some earlier work by Katz (1964) on Organizational Citizenship Behaviour which talks about Organization Commitment.</p>, <p>Engagement was first described by William Kahn in 1990 but was made popular by Gallup’s ‘First break all the rules’ book of 1999. Since then most organizations have been conducting some form of engagment survey.</p>, <p>During the same sort of timeframe the technology for completing surveys has changed. In the 1990s and before most surveys were still done on paper. When web technology started to enter the employee survey space we saw surveys which were fundamentally a replication of a paper survey done electronically. This made sense at first as many organizations spent some time doing both in parallel. We still see paper in some environments such as delivery drivers.</p>, <p><strong>About the surveys</strong></p>, <p>Engagement surveys tend to follow a common design - they ask a set of questions to create an engagement index. Mostly this is in the region of 5 questions. They then ask a large number of questions to identify items which are linked to that engagement. Most annual surveys are in the range of 60 - 150 questions long. I would estimate it takes about 20 - 30 seconds for an employee to answer each question.</p>, <p>Data is also used to consider the demographics of each participant. We see both self-reported demographics and demographics that are imported from other HR systems. The latter is a more effective way of getting good data but in some firms there are concerns about privacy.</p>, <p>There is a potentially enormous number of factors that could be associated with engagement. As Kieron Shaw noted in “Employee engagement, how to build a high-performance workforce.”:</p>, <p>Hence, however long the survey is the designer has to have selected a subset of potential factors.</p>, <p><strong>Criticisms of traditional surveys.</strong></p>, <p>In a fascinating paper <a href=""http://www.andrewbgraham.ca/uploads/1/2/5/1/12517834/employeeengagement.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">“Measuring Employee Engagement: Off the Pedestal and into the Toolbox”</a> Andrew Graham of Queen's University notes 9 issues with the traditional survey:</p>, <p>A tenth issue that we find as analysts is that there is typically an illusion of richness. Many firms think that by asking 80 questions they are capturing 80 independent data points. This is clearly not the case.</p>, <p><strong>Issues with survey data</strong></p>, <p>One of the analyses that we like to do with survey data is to build a correlation graph. This uses each question as a node and the correlation between each question as an edge. When you visualise survey data in this manner you typically get something like the following:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>What we see is a hairball. Each question tends to be highly correlated with another. (In the graph above Questions 31 - 33 are questions that the HR team wanted to add relating to a process which obviously has little link to engagement).</p>, <p>We’ve done experiments with survey data where we ‘destroyed’ 80% of all answers randomly and then used recommendation algorithms to back-fill what had been removed. In most instances we’re able to accurately replace what has been removed. People answer in patterns (hence that hairball), and if you know some answers you can pretty accurately infer what all the others will be (this means that you could probably randomly ask each employee different questions and dramatically shorten the survey without much loss in accuracy).</p>, <p><strong>Issues with User Interfaces</strong></p>, <p>This is a bit more contentious. It relates to how questions are asked.</p>, <p>Most employee surveys use Likert-scale questions, mostly 5 points between strongly agree and strongly disagree. One of the reasons for doing this has been that on a paper survey it’s easy to get someone to code the data into a reporting system (it’s easy to see a check in a box). What has been done is to take this process that was designed for paper and put it onto the web with little thought in terms of adapting the question to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the new medium.</p>, <p>Employees actually have a true feeling on a continuum between the two end points. When you ask them to answer on a 5 or 7 point scale what you’re actually doing is asking them to ‘bin’ their true feeling to the nearest compromise point. Doing so is adding burden on the survey taker and potentially adding inaccuracy in the data. The data can’t be seen as linear, instead one should use statistical methods appropriate for ordinal data.</p>, <p>In a 2012 paper in the journal Field Methods “Why Semantic Differentials in Web-Based Research Should be Made From Visual Analogue Scales and Not From 5-Point Scales”, Funke &amp; Reips show experimental evidence that show that marking a line between two points - a visual analogue scale - has numerous advantages over traditional 5 point scales. Two of these are better (more accurate) data and less burden on the survey taker. </p>, <p>Whether the answer is a visual analogue scale or something with a large but distinct number of points (the 0-10 scale used by NPS practitioners?) is harder to determine. However I see little evidence that 5 points is the right approach.</p>, <p><strong>Should we even be asking scale-based questions?</strong></p>, <p>Finally, too often what drives executive action from survey data is the responses to a few open text questions. As Graham notes on his fourth issue survey data rarely provides context. The qualitative nature of open text does provide this opportunity. </p>, <p>Often the initial action from a survey is to do more qualitative research focussing on several key topics. Such research is both time consuming and expensive. (Arguably acting without understanding the context can be more expensive).</p>, <p>There are instances where asking a scale question makes sense, most notably if you’re wanting to report a trend. However asking sufficiently broad, open questions will likely capture richer data. The challenge for many firms is how to do this at scale.</p>, <p>If we think about how we’d try to understand an issue in a conversation we’d ask open questions and then follow up with relevant and probing follow-up questions. I firmly believe this will be the future of employee feedback, though it will be a bot-based conversational approach which can be done in multiple languages and at scale.</p>, <p>As an industry we’re currently not there but the future is coming quickly. In the next article I’ll describe the current state, our findings of working with clients at the cutting-edge and highlight some approaches taken by other innovators in this market.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>, <p>Andrew is one of the pioneers of the European People Analytics scene.

The 27 best HR Analytics articles of H1 2016,Part 2 – Employee feedback and engagement – The Future,14. Andrew Marritt –,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/employee-feedback-engagement-measurement-future-andrew-marritt?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>In the <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/engagement-surveys-part-1-issues-traditional-approach-marritt?trk=pulse_spock-articles"" target=""_blank"">last post</a> I gave some background on how we got to the current state on measuring engagement and employee perceptions. In this one I’m going to give an overview of where we see the market going. It's a personal view, but one from someone at the coal-face.</p>, <p>There’s an expression in english that ‘if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail’. I think a large part of what has driven us to the current position is that businesses felt that all they had was the long, annual engagement survey ‘hammer’.</p>, <p>In the last article I cited Andrew Graham’s 9 issues with traditional employee research:</p>, <p>There are some other drivers which seem to be contributing to change, or at least a desire to change:</p>, <p><strong>The first response: Pulse surveys.</strong></p>, <p>Let me start by saying that I think the gold-standard is doing both an annual survey with other, more immediate ways of capturing feedback either on a schedule or/and aligned to key employee events. However, in the real world businesses need to allocate short resources to where they believe they get the most impact. I think the annual survey will become rare over time.</p>, <p>The biggest trend which we’ve seen over the last 5 years is the emergence of the pulse survey. These are regular, shorter surveys which typically use technology and automation to address many of the issues above.</p>, <p>All pulse surveys try to address several of these issues, most notably the issue of frequency (and the linked issue that survey data gets old). Reporting is usually automated and several tools automate more advanced analysis showing linkages between variables and engagement.</p>, <p>However there are tradeoffs. There is a burden on the survey taker each time they take the survey and the only way of achieving decent response rates whilst asking more frequently is to shorten the survey, potentially reducing richness. As I noted in the last article, this might not be such an issue if you randomise some questions and use missing-data inference techniques but few providers are doing this (and many HR departments remain unconvinced).</p>, <p>There is also an issue in terms of how frequently you can ask employees to take a pulse survey. There is no right and wrong answer but there are some things that are worth considering.</p>, <p>We’re seeing that engagement at the individual level is remarkably stable. Most people answer the same way month in month out, potentially only changing by by a small amount if they do change (and we have to assume this could be a measurement error). You only need to measure a stable thing frequently if you’ve got a large measurement error. In these instances data should be smoothed before reporting as your issue is how to deal with noise.</p>, <p>Furthermore employees get frustrated if they’re asked the same question on a regular basis &amp; they don’t see action, which is hard to demonstrate if the survey frequency is too short. I think you can get away with this for one or two ‘trend’ questions but there needs to be some change to make it feel worthwhile.</p>, <p>In our experience, a happy compromise is gathering engagement-type feedback on a quarterly basis. The best firms are using the non-engagement months to plan a series of topics where employee feedback is valuable and by capturing experience-type feedback around key events</p>, <p><strong>Better UI isn’t a sustainable competitive advantage</strong></p>, <p>Al pulse survey providers have embraced modern web technology to provide a more consumer-like experience. The is seen in both the survey-taking interface, where a good, mobile-friendly interface is probably now a hygiene-factor and to a lesser degree the reporting side.</p>, <p>One of the early incentives that encouraged us to build Workometry was the experience of how much data cleaning &amp; preparation was needed with the existing solutions. Capturing the data in a way that you need it for analysis and automating the boring data preparation process brings speed, quality and cost improvements.</p>, <p>From a reporting side it’s now relatively simple to build a manager- or even employee-level interface that reports the data in a clean and understandable manner.</p>, <p>Many of the current entrants into the market aim to do just this. They bring a reduced overall cost to what has been done manually. However my view is that the way to compete in this part of the market will end up being on price. This is great if you’re a small to mid sized client as historically the consultancy-led approach was too expensive without scale. It probably means that we’ll see consolidation in this part of the market.</p>, <p><strong>Thinking about the data</strong></p>, <p>Here is where I think it gets more interesting. As I noted before the advent of more sophisticated analysis activities with employee data is creating a demand for better, more integrated data. At the same time there continues to be a need to ensure confidentiality, especially preventing reporting down to small groups.</p>, <p>This is a challenge which can be addressed by technology. APIs can provide data consumption whilst maintaining confidentiality. Newer forms of data stores, like the schema-less one that underpins our Workometry product can provide great flexibility. We’ve got to a stage where realistically we don’t have a constraint from the size of the data. If we want to compare people who answered a particular question this month with how they answered another question last quarter that’s possible. If we just want to be in a position where we can capture and analyse many millions of data points a year technology or cost of technology isn’t a constraint.</p>, <p>The second factor about thinking about data is always to question where the best data is to be found. We shouldn’t be asking employees about things in surveys which we could understand from another source. In particular I think of the questions about process compliance. Surely we should be able to gather this data from a system? Only ask what you need to ask.</p>, <p>A key factor with employee listening is that it’s iterative and conversational. That means you can’t know with certainty what you’ll need to ask in the future, or what data you’ll need to integrate. Enterprises need to select these new technologies with this in mind. How can the data be integrated into models? How can it be queried in real-time for models in production?</p>, <p><strong>Think about the analysis, but start at the action.</strong></p>, <p>It’s easy to report data but this typically doesn’t bring much insight. We believe that with all analysis we need to work back from the outcome - what you’ll do when you have the insight. Understanding what you can and want to possibly change should be an input into what data you capture. </p>, <p>Dealing with survey data, and especially mixed survey-behaviour or survey-demographic data is difficult. Even if we understand that in many questions we’re dealing with ordinal data that guide us to a certain subset of possible analyses (and not the typical ones which are easy in Excel). As I’ve written in the past, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141127114600-78008-in-hr-analytics-don-t-be-constrained-by-your-data-structure?trk=pulse_spock-articles"" target=""_blank"">we’re big fans of using graphical models</a> and much of our survey work relies on relationships - relationships between variables and relationships between variables.</p>, <p>As the data size increases along with the complexity Machine Learning is increasingly being used to identify insight from the data. Where we used to cut the data by a demographic function we’re increasingly looking for non-linear relationships, identifying small and micro segments and attempting to link demographics, behaviours and perceptions.</p>, <p><strong>Text</strong></p>, <p>I have <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-text-analytics-changing-employee-survey-andrew-marritt?trk=pulse_spock-articles"" target=""_blank"">written about this before</a>. In our view capturing and understanding employees own words is the key breakthrough that will happen in employee feedback in the next few years. This mirrors what we’re seeing with customer research.</p>, <p>Traditionally there was almost a binary split between quantitive and qualitative research work. In reality there was always a continuum. It was always technically possible to do qual work at scale, however it was prohibitively expensive and time consuming.</p>, <p>What we’re seeing with modern text analytics is that that supply curve has shifted. It’s now possible to ask a survey with mostly open text questions and to ask it to hundreds of thousands of individuals. This opens up great opportunities in terms of increasing the richness of data, the attractiveness of providing data from the user’s perspective and a flexibility and agility in design.</p>, <p>From our experience (and we think we’re probably in a leading position in this space) text analytics is highly domain-specific. It is unwise to think you can parse text through a general tool, or one designed for another domain. </p>, <p><strong>Bots</strong></p>, <p>I mentioned this in the last article and received some questions. I think we’re heading for a position where technology-enabled employee research will be conversational. The employee will be asked an open question about a particular topic and depending on the response they give a relevant follow-on open question will be asked.</p>, <p>In the short term these technologies will be text-based but it’s likely it will move to voice. I see a future where a system identifies who it needs to speak to, telephones them and asks a series of questions to try and drill-down to the key drivers. It will be able to do this at scale.</p>, <p>The issue to some degree isn’t the analysis, it’s the ability to do this in a way which isn’t intrusive for the user and where there are strong incentives for them to participate. This is what is exciting about research. Analysis is closely related and enabled by design-driven changes. Better interfaces = better data = better analysis = better insight.</p>, <p><strong>The future</strong></p>, <p>Where is all of this taking us?</p>, <p>I see the engagement-app market diverging. On one side are employers who want to understand engagement but do so in a cost-effective manner. These firms will gravitate to the mass of engagement apps offering real-time capture. Buyers should be aware of the value these tools are providing - it’s mainly focussed on delivering metrics in a speedy and cost effective manner. These providers will make most headway in the part of the market where traditional providers couldn’t be cost-effective, ie SME businesses. Those who can add sophistication and scale up to enterprise clients will be disruptive.</p>, <p>The other side are firms and products like our own which see machine learning technology as a way of automating the higher-skilled parts of the historic research bundle. In the first instance firms like ours are using ML to automate much of the skilled work of the experienced engagement consultants.</p>, <p>I think the ultimate role will be disrupting traditional management consultancy. Tools which can <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/employee-feedback-should-more-than-asking-people-job-andrew-marritt?trk=pulse_spock-articles"" target=""_blank"">ask and understand an almost open set of questions</a> can disrupt much of the information-gathering parts of the traditional consulting offering.</p>, <p>None of this completely removes the need for great consultants, but it means that deep expertise, or the creative parts of the process are where the opportunity arises. Consultants will increasingly focus on developing strategic plans and advising on change management. There might be fewer employed by employee research firms, but I think this shift will increase the demand for those at the top of their games.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>, <p>Andrew is one of the pioneers of the European People Analytics scene.

The 27 best HR Analytics articles of H1 2016,Part 1,17. Richard Rosenow – HR Analytics Starter Kit:,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-starter-kit-part-1-richard-rosenow-pmp?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>I’ve had some people reach out to me recently asking how to learn more about getting involved with analytics in human resources.  I was surprised to hear from them as I feel like I still have a lot to learn myself, but I understand where they’re coming from.  From the outside, even trying to determine which search words to type into Google is daunting – HR data, HR analytics, Workforce Intelligence, Talent Analytics, People Analytics, Workforce Analytics… the list goes on. </p>, <p>However, this makes sense for a new field of work.  Part human resources, part data science, and part business savvy; it’s slowly taking shape and finding its footing.  As technological capabilities are growing and demand for insights about the workforce is exploding there has been a lot of concurrent development of the field creating many exciting and different takes on it.  I’m sure it’ll settle on a name and core identity eventually, but for the purposes of this post, I'll refer to the field at large as HR analytics.</p>, <p>I had been hearing about HR analytics myself for a few years before diving in. Interest in the field has been rumbling and has recently exploded as a hot topic in the HR world (<a href=""http://www.shrm.org/publications/hrmagazine/editorialcontent/2016/0216/pages/0216-hr-analysts.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Growing Demand for HR Analysts</a>).  About a year ago I set out with intent to find out who was doing this work well and how to get involved in the conversation.  I’m still falling down the rabbit hole of learning about HR analytics, but I'd love to share with you what I've found so far to help you get up to speed too.</p>, <p>In my experience the hardest part of learning about HR analytics is sorting through the vast number of search results to find the substantial content.  The majority of articles and learnings hype the newness and excitement of HR analytics without providing any tangible insights or recommendations.  This might drive traffic to their site, but this tactic drives me crazy. </p>, <p>I've started a collection below of what I think is some of the most substantial content on HR analytics.  My goal here is to curate an ""HR Analytics Starter Kit"" that delivers not only on the excitement, but also conveys the deeper understanding that someone is looking for when they are trying to get up to speed.  For part one of the Starter Kit, I’ve categorized articles that I've found over the past year into three areas that I think would be useful to someone just getting started - Excitement, Implementation, and Examples.  </p>, <p><em>These are the articles that get you pumped up about HR analytics.  If you’re in the working world and have been tasked with “finding out what we can do with HR analytics” then your executive has probably read (or skimmed) one of these types of articles.  If you yourself are already excited about HR analytics, these are the types of articles that will remind you the potential benefits of the work you're undertaking.</em></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/geeks-have-arrived-people-analytics-here-josh-bersin"" target=""_blank""><em><strong>""The Geeks Have Arrived” by Josh Bersin</strong></em></a></p>, <p>I feel safe arguing that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin?"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> is one of the most, if not the most, recognized influencer in the field of HR analytics right now. As principal of <a href=""http://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">""Bersin by Deloitte""</a>, he and his incredibly talented team produce top notch insights and reports about the state HR analytics. ""The Geeks Have Arrived"" is an older article now (Jan 2015), but I feel it is a fundamental reading to understanding where the field came from and where it is today. Bersin reviews the history of analytics in HR, tees up frameworks, and develops the argument for how exciting this field can become.</p>, <p class=""left""><em><strong> </strong><strong><a href=""http://www.bna.com/advances-big-data-n17179925231/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">“Advances in ‘Big Data' and Analytics Can Unlock Insights and Drive HR Actions”</a> by Kurt Naasz</strong></em></p>, <p>The core of this article is really an interview with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentaylordata"" target=""_blank"">Ben Taylor</a>, Chief Data Scientist from <a href=""https://www.hirevue.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HireVue</a> (a digital interview and predictive analytics firm).  Ben has a number of brilliant insights and articles about the HR analytics field on Linkedin and <a href=""https://twitter.com/bentaylordata"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> and in this article he talks through what is my favorite analogy for describing the categories of analytics as a whole.  For those of you skimming this overview, here's the highlight:</p>, <p class=""left""><em><strong><a href=""http://blog.hrtecheurope.com/10-reasons-people-analytics-is-set-to-go-into-orbit-in-2016/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">“10 Reasons People Analytics is set to go into Orbit in 2016""</a> by David Green</strong></em></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrgreen"" target=""_blank"">David Green</a> is the Global Director of People Analytics Solutions at <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/software/smarterworkforce/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">IBM smarter Workforce</a>, but also manages to be one of the most prolific influencers in the HR analytics space.  He is hands down one of my favorite authors on Linkedin due to his informal style and sincere passion about helping grow the field.  His <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140925070104-12091643-top-50-hr-analytics-influencers-part-1?"" target=""_blank"">72 Influencers Lists</a> are a ""who's who"" of HR analytics and a must read to anyone looking to build out a twitter feed for this space.</p>, <p class=""left""><em><strong><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/12/theyre-watching-you-at-work/354681/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">“They're Watching You at Work” </a>by Don Peck</strong></em></p>, <p>I have to give a shout-out to this article because it's the one that introduced me to what the world could look like with HR analytics.  Starting with history of the field and building up to some of the revolutionary work being completed by <a href=""https://www.gild.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gild</a> and <a href=""http://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a>, it's an article to read when you have a solid 30 minutes to an hour to just stew on your thoughts and then go off on tangents exploring the companies reviewed in the text.</p>, <p><em>A little more subdued than the excitement articles, these get into more of the nitty-gritty of starting and running an HR analytics function.  What should it look like?  Who should be hired?  These articles may appeal to someone who has been charged with developing a plan.</em></p>, <p><em><strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-big-data-through-lens-psychology-part-i-pylin"" target=""_blank"">“HR Analytics through the lens of IO Psych” </a>by Pylin Chuapetcharasopon, PhD</strong></em></p>, <p>I have not seen another article that so thoroughly overviews what HR analytics is and what it could be than this set of articles by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/pylinc"" target=""_blank"">Pylin Chuapetcharasopon</a>.

The 27 best HR Analytics articles of H1 2016,Part 2 – Intro to R,17. Richard Rosenow – HR Analytics Starter Kit:,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-starter-kit-part-2-intro-r-richard-rosenow-pmp?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>Welcome to part 2 of the HR Analytics Starter Kit! My goal in writing these has been to share with you some of the most substantial articles and resources I’ve found while exploring the HR analytics space to help you get up to speed. For those of you arriving here at part 2 first, there’s not a particular sequence to reading these, but here is the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-starter-kit-part-1-richard-rosenow-pmp"" target=""_blank"">link to part I</a> in case you feel compelled to start there. </p>, <p>In part 1 I walked through some of the most substantial articles I had found in three groupings that I labeled Excitement (get excited about HR analytics), Implementation (how to think about developing an HR analytics function), and Example (examples of HR analytics in action). Here in part 2 I’d like to review some of the tools to help you start performing HR analytics with a focus on R.</p>, <p>I’m a huge Excel nerd, but to perform analysis on large datasets, Excel starts to slow down. Setting up multiple statistical tests in Excel can also be time consuming and complicated. If you don’t have <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/blog/post/HR-Technology-For-2016-Ten-Disruptions-On-The-Horizon.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">embedded analytics</a> within your current HR management software then you might want to think about picking up a more robust tool to analyze, interpret, and visualize your data.</p>, <p>Some of the most popular tools that I’ve seen HR practitioners use are Excel, Tableau, R, SAS, SPSS and Python, with a few recent articles stating that <a href=""http://insidebigdata.com/2016/03/15/the-best-data-scientists-run-r-and-python/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">R and Python are leading the pack</a> as far as popularity. There’s not a golden standard for analytics work and in the end it’s a question of capability, cost, and even more so preference. My recommendation to someone just starting down this path would be to take a look at R. </p>, <p>R is an open source statistical programming language. To rephrase, R is FREE software that you could download today that lets you run analysis on large datasets quickly. Just to reiterate – free! I want to pause on that and recognize how rare it is for HR to get access to a cutting edge tool at no cost. It’s one of the benefits of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hrs-last-mover-advantage-predictive-analytics-richard-rosenow-pmp"" target=""_blank"">HR being a last mover into the data science space</a> . Well known companies have been using R for a long time now (<a href=""http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/05/facebooks-on-line-course-on-exploratory-data-analysis-with-r.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/05/the-arteries-of-the-world-in-tweets.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>, and <a href=""http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2011/08/google-r-effective-ads.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Google </a>to name a few popular ones) and the <a href=""http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/05/companies-using-r-in-2014.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">applications of R across the business</a> are profound. </p>, <p>I understand that asking you to consider learning a programming language to analyze data sounds intimidating and I'll admit that R has a <a href=""http://r4stats.com/articles/why-r-is-hard-to-learn/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">steep learning curve</a>. So in the sections below, I want to lay out an on-ramp of resources to ease you into R, point you in the direction of some early technical resources, and then review the few substantial technical examples I have found that apply R to HR solutions. </p>, <p>We're starting off with two videos; the first 90 seconds and the second 45 minutes. Watch the first one now if you're relatively new to R and bookmark the other for later.</p>, <p>This first one is put together by <a href=""http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/what-r"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Revolution Analytics</a> (which was recently <a href=""http://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/opinion/Will-the-R-language-benefit-from-Microsoft-acquisition"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">purchased by Microsoft</a>) and covers R at a high level. This puts some context around why you might be interested in learning or working with it. If this is one of the first times you’re hearing about R, it’d be worth watching before moving forward. </p>, <p>This second video is more technical and the speaker <a href=""http://www.johndcook.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">John Cook</a> provides a great history and context for the language. As the title suggests he frames up the good, the bad, and the ugly of R and this mindset sets the stage well for someone starting down this path. He also provides some of the best advice I’ve heard for working with R's steep learning curve. He says that:</p>, <p>In other words, if you just learn R for R’s sake, you’re probably going to run out of motivation. My advice would be to find an HR problem you want to tackle, maybe one you’ve already worked through in excel, and try to apply R to it to get to the same results. </p>, <p>If I can add anything to his explanation, I would say that whatever it is you want to do in R, you can do it. The beauty of R being open source and modular is that experts in every field are working with the same system and adding to it every day. That and Google is your best friend (“i.e. How do I run regression in R?”). There’s a massive and incredibly helpful community out there working through every question you could possibly run into.</p>, <p><a href=""http://tryr.codeschool.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Try R: Code School Course</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong></p>, <p>Code school is a fascinating website. They’ve built the coding prompts right into the lessons which allows for a seamless learning experience. For someone who just wants to see what coding in R is like, the introduction they provide is a low commitment learning tool that make the language accessible and reduces some of the fears around picking it up.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.r-project.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>R Website</em></strong></a><strong><em> &amp; </em></strong><a href=""https://www.rstudio.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>R Studio Website </em></strong></a></p>, <p>The best technical resource for learning R is to download the software and poke around. R is free to download and use and quick to set up. By itself, R will do what you need, but R Studio is a program that sits on top of R and provides you with more point and click options for analysis instead of just running code through text entry like you would in base R. From what I've seen R Studio is recommended almost across the board for R among beginners and experts. </p>, <p>For those of you interested in potentially picking up R, these are some of the best early resources I found.</p>, <p><a href=""http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>R for Data Science</em></strong></a><strong><em> by Hadley Wickham</em></strong></p>, <p>Hadley Wickham is nothing short of famous in the R world. He's the Chief Scientist at R Studio (founder) and creator of the tidyverse set of packages. His (graciously) open source book on using R for Data Science is one of the best places to start if you're exploring this tool.</p>, <p><a href=""https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/intro-to-r-for-microsoft-excel-users"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>How to transition from Excel to R</em></strong></a><strong><em> by Tony Ojeda</em></strong></p>, <p>One of the most helpful articles when I got started. I mentioned I love Excel, but it’s more of an addiction than anything else. Above all this article helped assure me that I could still do in R what I already knew how to do in Excel. </p>, <p><a href=""https://www.r-podcast.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>The R Podcast</em></strong></a><strong><em> by Eric Nantz</em></strong></p>, <p>The R podcast is thorough in it's explanations. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-nantz-6621617"" target=""_blank"">Eric Nantz</a> is a statistician with an unmatched knack for explaining the nuances and verbiage that goes along with learning R. I spent a few months struggling through R before coming across his podcast.

The 27 best HR Analytics articles of H1 2016,Keeping Strategic Workforce Planning and People Analytics together delivers significant benefits,18. Martin Oest – Keeping Strategic Workforce Planning and People Analytics together delivers significant benefits,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/keeping-strategic-workforce-planning-swp-people-analytics-martin-oest?trk=hp-feed-article-title-publish,"[<p><b>Why?</b> Simply because it leads to evidence based, and therefore, better decisions.</p>, <p><b>How?</b> Understanding what is really going on, rather than following urban or corporate myths, requires data. And a good level of analysis of the data at that. This can be anything from the very simple to a more in-depth statistical modelling. The output will (when it works well) then be a decision brief from which the organisation can make well informed decisions and decisions, as we all know, drive a business forward.</p>, <p>So, can keeping SWP and People Analytics together really make you more profitable or more successful at what you do? Well whilst not a guarantee, it will certainly increase the probability of a positive outcome. But, isn’t bringing them together just complicating things? No, not if it is done well.</p>, <p>The above quote is from an <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/sylviavorhausersmith/2015/05/25/workforce-planning-the-war-room-of-hr/#3ca5aea57373"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">article</a> by <a href=""https://au.linkedin.com/in/sylviavorhausersmith"" target=""_blank"">Sylvia Vorhauser-Smith</a> and resonates with my own experience of workforce planning (be it strategic or operational) -you need to make numbers your friend. Historically this has not been a key focus for people in HR, people have, but I don’t think you can focus on people in a fair and productive way without the numbers  - and there is a lot of evidence on biased processes which supports this too.</p>, <p>Let me give you a couple of simple examples to illustrate what analytical, 'numbers friendly' work can deliver.</p>, <p>Understanding the real reason why revenue and profitability is down in an organisation can sometimes be hard. It is easy to say that marketing misunderstood what the customers really needed and wanted, or that product development interpreted this incorrectly when they developed gadget X.</p>, <p>Let’s say the front line staff that sell and service the products have not changed in terms of top line numbers and I, as a strong/vocal sales manager, am pointing my finger at other departments to blame (I am surely not at fault as that would reduce my bonus!). ‘Obviously’ the decrease in revenue is not because we are poor at selling in our stores. I have the same total headcount as always, numbers of leavers and hires have remained essentially constant as have absence levels. There have been no changes in process either.</p>, <p>So what's really going on? Well what may be missed without a more analytical approach is that although attrition shows no overall change in numbers there is a significant change in the profile of the staff leaving! It could be high performing staff or staff in critical roles for example that when identified and understood clearly explains the underperformance of the sales targets and points the way for possible solutions to effectively rectify the issue.</p>, <p>Another relevant case (and one combining SWP and People Analytics) is from the <a href=""http://www.kornferry.com/institute"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Korn Ferry Institute</a> in their “<a href=""http://www.kornferry.com/institute/why-chros-really-are-ceos?all-topics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Why CHROs really are CEOs</a>” from April 12, 2016 in which the company in question had a heavy concentration of long-term employees among its top 250 and saw innovation stalling. A long term plan was put in place to increase the number of staff in the top 250 with fewer than 5 years’ tenure and this actually resulted in more innovation, new thinking and ideas.</p>, <p>The benefits of this kind of detailed people analytics is further shown by a MIT / IBM study as reported by SAP on October 28, 2015 (<a href=""http://startupfocus.saphana.com/blogs/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">how analytics are becoming important for HR</a>). Companies with a high level of HR analytics had:</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>However despite this I, and so many others, have struggled to find the capability at the level we need to set-up a single analytical function in HR. Pooling resources in my mind is an excellent approach - at least in the medium term as capabilities are being built.</strong></p>, <p><strong>All this leads me to my own conclusion that HR is, for now, best to bring together SWP and People Analytics and that this will  be the best scenario for most organisations.</strong></p>, <p><strong>This approach will consolidate scarce resources and enable a focused prioritisation of work to deliver those things which will have the biggest impact for the business.</strong></p>, <p><strong>Urgency is key. Delay and you could lose your best employees and  sales and market share. What's more this could be happening right in front of you without you even knowing.

The 27 best HR Analytics articles of H1 2016,Does your HR Analytics program create business impact?,20. Mayank Jain – Does your HR Analytics program create business impact?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/does-your-hr-analytics-program-create-business-impact-mayank-jain?trk=hp-feed-article-title-comment,"[<p><strong>My “Aha” Moment: Is Attrition probability worth calculating?</strong></p>, <p>In 2010, my leader, Penny Meier created an “Aha” moment in my career. She asked my team that were excitedly debating refinements to an already break-through Data Analytics model. It gave the attrition probability for each employee! She simply asked if we had attrition rates high enough for the company to try solving for? Our voluntary attrition rates being in single digits, made us realize why our breakthrough analysis, would create little business impact.</p>, <p>This is just one example showing that there is more to a successful HR Analytics program than outstanding predictive data analysis. It requires solving for three types of challenges: Foundational, Relevance and Execution:</p>, <p><strong>Foundational Challenge</strong>:</p>, <p>When discussing some of our best analysis with leaders, they would look at names in the underlying row level data set. Immediately, we would hear, “But Mark actually terminated in a different month”, “Where is John who transferred into the group last month?”, or worse “This data is already two months old!” All this, even though the overall inferences and insights were unassailable.</p>, <p>Foundational challenges relate to data accuracy, headcount accounting and slicing/dicing data quickly. Given the nature of HR data (discrete individuals vs specific dollar bills), solving for this requires many stars to align, including processes, systems/tools, metric definitions, training, audits and of course, people accountabilities.</p>, <p><strong>Relevance Challenge</strong>: I am reminded of a story by <a href=""http://ceo.usc.edu/research_scientist/boudreau.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dr. John Boudreau </a>and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/pete-ramstad-32b0258"" target=""_blank"">Pete Ramstad</a>, who wrote the seminal book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-HR-Science-Human-Capital/dp/142210415X"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Beyond HR</a>. They describe this man searching for his lost key where the light was shining instead of where the key was likely to be - just as we were doing in focusing our analysis purely on attrition instead of a more pressing business problem.</p>, <p>This challenge relates to questions like:</p>, <p><strong>Execution Challenge</strong>: Many of my Workforce Analytics colleagues, have built truly amazing models that predict people outcomes or provide behavioral correlations quite accurately. At the same time we need to ask:</p>, <p><span class=""underline"">For companies to realize the true impact of HR Analytics, we need to put mechanisms and forums in place, where we have those decisions taken, actioned and followed up with</span>.</p>, <p>Based on my eighteen years of experience in related fields of Financial Analysis, Business Transformation and Internal Consulting, in this Post series, I will share my learnings on creating and running a successful Strategic Workforce Planning and Analytics program. I will also cover solutions that have worked and not worked in solving for the above challenges, including team structure and skill sets required.</p>, <p>In this first part, let me start by defining Workforce Planning and Analytics, its objectives and why it is critical to the success of every company.</p>, <p><strong>What is Workforce Planning &amp; Analytics and what should it solve for?</strong></p>, <p>There are many aspects to Workforce Planning and Analytics. Implementation of the right technology systems (of which there are a myriad), dashboards, basic data analytics, talent gap analysis, org structures, hiring plans, location strategy, all get thrown into the mix! And then there is predictive data science that catches everyone’s fancy</p>, <p>To be fair, it can be a combination of the above. Depending upon the environment and critical requirements of the business, a few areas might be the dominant ones. This is where, judgment comes in, for the Program to have the right focus.</p>, <p><span class=""underline"">Ultimately, a Workforce Planning and Analytics program should aim to help business leaders achieve their targets by ensuring they have the Workforce required to enable their Business Strategy.</span></p>, <p> <strong>Why it is critical to the success of long-term business strategy</strong></p>, <p>For any long term strategic business plan to be successful, it needs to be accompanied by its key enabling requirements. I often ask my counterparts in Strategy functions, about the three <span class=""underline"">People related assumptions implicit in their Strategic business plans</span>:</p>, <p>In today’s environment, where People can create differentiation and Competitive Advantage, it is imperative for a company to take informed and timely ""Human Capital"" decisions for the above assumptions to be met. It is for enabling it to do so successfully, that a company needs to invest in a strong Workforce Planning and Analytics capability.</p>, <p>I will close by quoting Dr. John Boudreau’s challenge that is the best case for such a capability:</p>, <p><strong>“Do you make decisions about your People with the same rigor, logic and confidence as your decisions about Money, Customers, Products and Technology?”</strong></p>, <p>In my subsequent post, I will talk about stages in Workforce Planning and Analytics and address specific solutions to the three challenges outlined earlier.</p>]"

Metrics give us an opportunity to view the organization in a less personal, higher and more precise way.</p>, <p>Without a metric it may be possible to observe, for example: ""hmm, we seem to be having a lot of people leaving the organization."" A HR Metric, on the other hand, can help us to measure that in a way that allows us compare a current rate to prior point in time, compare the rate of one segment to another, compare the rate to an external benchmark and compare the rate to some goal.</p>, <p>These features of metrics are clearly good, and the reason why we have HR Metrics in the first place, however there are problems that make constructing HR metrics difficult: </p>, <p>Some organizations are abandoning HR Metrics entirely. This is partly based on the difficulty of creating a scalable architecture for HR Metrics and partly as a result in a shifting interest to pursue more advanced People Analytics methods, like prediction.</p>, <p>I agree that our historical emphasis on HR metrics and approach to produce those metrics left something to be desired.  Unlike others, I do not believe in wholesale abandonment of HR Metrics entirely. That said, I think we need to be careful.

The 27 best HR Analytics articles of H1 2016,The new 4th prong of HR Analytics,24. Ben Taylor – The new 4th prong of HR Analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-4th-prong-hranalytics-ben-taylor-ai-hacker,"[<p>Doing data science or analysis within HR is complicated, suddenly model accuracy is no longer the top concern. There are secondary objectives, and if overlooked they can prick you. The most discussed is that of adverse impact, which we have seen a lot on social lately around machine learning. Here are some quick examples:</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Are you propagating or creating bias in your modeling techniques? Are the humans teaching the computers to behave badly? If so, how do you mitigate that and reduce that effect? </p>, <p><strong>An HR Data Science Approach [ 2 prong ]</strong> </p>, <p>For data scientists who exist within HR analytics, there are two prongs they are concerned about addressing. Those are model validity and model diversity. The data scientists want the models that have the maximum predictive power (r, AUC, PR, accuracy, etc...). The second one is diversity, the model must not propagate or create an adverse impact on race, age, gender, disability, or veteran status. The objective is simple enough, the data scientist will define a number from 0 to 1 for performance validity (r, AUC, etc..) and a metric from 0 to 1 for diversity (Minority selection rate, etc...). Then they will require that <em>someone else</em> takes responsibility and decides what the priorities are between these two objectives. Do we only care about validity? Do we only care about diversity? For most cases, it depends. It depends on the risk tolerance of the employer and the defensibility of the performance data. </p>, <p><strong>An IO Psych Approach [ 3 prong ]</strong> </p>, <p>IO Psychs have been at this game longer. They have seen and observed a vast variety of evolving class action lawsuits. There is a third prong, and that is job relatedness. You must collect features that can be defended for being job-related. A common example I like to give would be 3D accelerometer data from your mobile phone. Did you know that when you walk around with your phone in your pocket a data scientist can predict if you are walking up stairs, walking, walking down stairs, or (my personal favorite) walking and talking with someone. Even your own personal identity can be predicted from your moving phone data compared to someone else. </p>, <p>The 3D Accelerometer data of your phone is rich enough to predict some surprising classifications. Suppose an HR startup was created that was able to download a candidate's 3D phone movement behavior and predict job performance from that. Sounds silly? Silly as it may be, the data set is so rich I can promise you that you would find some predictive validity. Suppose now, that you were even able to show no adverse impact, is this good enough for legal defensibility? The third prong becomes clear here where you would have a difficult time arguing that this feature set is job-related. The same arguments crop up with those chasing performance validity in social data such as Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, or Instagram. Yes, they are predictive, but can you defend job relatedness? For these types of exotic feature sets that seem removed from the job, they can be used, but first, they have to be mapped back to a job-related competency (i.e. grit, communication, etc...). </p>, <p>The problems we are all solving within HR are HARD! They are not single objective anymore, but complex multiple objective optimizations where even the weighting or priorities between these objectives become muddy and awkward. So if you build me a model with high-performance validity [check], great diversity with no adverse impact [check], job-related [check] most might assume that all bases have been covered here. In my discussions at various speaking events and polling the crowd on what is ok and what has crossed an ethics boundary I have realized there is a new 4th prong out there. I consider this 4th prong the ""predetermined destiny"" predictor.</p>, <p><strong>Predetermined destiny, the new prong [ 4 prong ]</strong></p>, <p>The moment you cross the line where you suggest a feature that is uncoachable/unchangeable and potentially predetermined the crowd no longer cares about you satisfying the 3 prongs. They are ready for torches and pitchforks. </p>, <p>These types of features include things like DNA (already illegal in the US). Remember the movie Gattaca? If you haven't seen it go and watch it and hopefully you will get a sense of why this feature can never be used for screening even if you cover the other 3 prongs. </p>, <p>Just because DNA is off the table doesn't mean there aren't others. The most recent one I saw was electrical signals from the brain. Did you guys see the guy from the UK that was able to fly a drone with just his mind using brain signals?</p>, <p>Just like movement signals are being classified from the brain waves a model could be built to predict familiarity or a new metric of cognitive ability. Imagine a job screening process where there are no spoken words during the interview. You wear this brain cap and watch an animation. Your brain response tells the employer how familiar you are with the job-related content, how smart you are, and by the time the slide show is over, there is enough data to determine if you are hired? Science fiction? Not really? Messed up? Very. This approach could begin to pick up on abilities that are no longer trainable. You either have them or you don't. Want to work for Google? You'll need a different brain. Right now, we at least feel we could pivot or redirect our lives to make anything happen. We may already be dealing with some form of predetermined destiny with SAT and ACT scores for admission, an argument I heard at SIOP two years ago, but most don't see it that way. </p>, <p>Curious what people think the other prongs or gotchas might be when building predictive models in HR. Besides predetermined destiny, you might argue a creep factor, if it is too creepy society might not accept it. </p>, <p><br/></p>]"

The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,The 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics (Crowd version),3. Patrick Coolen,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-crowd-version-patrick-coolen?trk=prof-post,"[<p>“The people analytics revolution is gaining speed” according to the Bersin by Deloitte report on global human capital trends. Organizations that feel fully capable to apply HR analytics doubled from 4% to 8%. Organizations that somewhat feel capable to apply HR analytics increased from 24% to 32%. And I am happy to see that my country (the Netherlands) is in the top of the list (together with India, Italy and Australia) that value HR analytics the most as important or very important. So yes, more organizations are actually stepping up.</p>, <p>But you can also look at the same statistics and ask yourself, “What is still holding back the larger part of all organizations?” You do not have to wait until you have the ‘best’ data, the ‘best’ data scientists, the ‘best’ tools or the ‘biggest’ budget (would be nice though), but you can learn while doing. There are many things you can do to get started. You can ask help from a vendor that helps you to kick-start your analytical practice. You can ask for help from other departments in your own organization. For larger organizations there are likely people already working on advanced analytics but in a different domain like marketing. You can also partner with universities who have the analytical capability to perform analyses on your data.</p>, <p>And an easy way to get informed and inspired is simply checking out all the experts that are writing about it on social media. Please read my previous posts for more references but this time I limit myself to two. First I strongly recommend you to follow <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrgreen"" target=""_blank"">David Green</a> (IBM) on social media when you are interested in HR analytics. You will find all practitioners, bloggers, trends, articles and events related to HR analytics via his excellent posts. Secondly I urge you to read the blog of <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/company/600383?trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Acompany%2CclickedEntityId%3A600383%2Cidx%3A2-1-2%2CtarId%3A1474049239662%2Ctas%3Ainostix"" target=""_blank"">iNostix</a>, recently acquired by Deloitte, our analytical partner, on all the latest developments on HR analytics. </p>, <p><strong>About the title</strong></p>, <p>I would like to express my gratitude to many of you who took the time and effort to provide me with feedback and ideas based on the previous versions of the 10 golden rules and other posts. I used some of your thoughts and merged them into this version. So this version is not solely based on our experience anymore but also on the wisdom of the crowd. That is why I think it is only fair to call this the 10 golden rules of HR analytics (crowd version).  </p>, <p><strong>Some examples</strong></p>, <p>Then some of you asked me to provide examples of our research. This makes of course a lot of sense. Only talking about pitfalls and best practices is nice but examples really show the opportunities of HR analytics. Please accept that I can’t share the outcomes and related benefits. Nevertheless I hope the list of some of our research questions gives more flavor and guidance on the questions that can be answered by HR analytics. </p>, <p>Now, after these examples, let us dive in to the 10 golden rules of HR analytics (crowd version). Of course there are some ‘oldies’ but please keep on reading, because I added some new insights and rule 9 and 10 are new. I sincerely hope this post provides you with some food for thought and that it motivates those who haven’t started yet to take that first step. </p>, <p>HR analytics is about having a ‘smarter’ look at your data. Typically you combine HR and business datasets and apply some analytical technique to find relationship in your data that can be used to make more informed decisions. Traditional statistics like ANOVA, correlations or regression analyses do the job pretty well in most cases. But I would advise you to go beyond statistics and explore other data mining techniques like random forest decision trees (K-nearest neighbour) or clustering (K/G-means). These techniques can be, depending on your data and business question, faster, more intuitive and more actionable. In other words, do not limit yourself to the ‘classical’ set of techniques. Try others as well, experiment and learn. Check below for a nice overview of possible (not all) approaches (iNostix by Deloitte). </p>, <p>Please focus your research on what is really important to your business. What keeps them awake? What are their opportunities? How do they define success? What are the most important key performance indicators of your business? The answer of course can vary per business from customer satisfaction, safety, revenues, costs, quality, absenteeism, risk management, employee satisfaction, leadership development to diversity. To find the right question you simply have to talk to your business first and ask them lots of questions. They are perfectly capable of expressing their worries and opportunities for their business. It is up to you to find the interesting topics that relate to the workforce. Also ask your business leaders if they are willing to change their views based on the research. They have to be committed to act on the insights, even if the insights do not fit their agenda. So stay close to the opportunities and threats of your business and you have the best change to immediately prove the added value of HR analytics. </p>, <p>Creating insights means nothing if your organization will not use them. To my opinion creating insights is actually the easy part because it is a technique that can be learned or outsourced. Like repeatedly stated, the process of creating insights is about using analytics in combination with experience and intuition. You need them all to interpret the outcomes and to make the right decision. Using analytics can be much more difficult because this deals with human beings having to understand the possibilities of analytics, accepting unexpected or counter-intuitive study outcomes, having the courage and will to act on it and to be persistent in the implementation of your actions over time.</p>, <p>Strong consultancy skills, talking the language of your business, story telling, intuitive visualizations and simplicity are some key ingredients to ‘sell’ your insights to your customer. And if you are successful in doing so, you can start thinking about what actions to take. Interesting is to think about where the responsibility of your analytical department ends? Is this right after delivering the insights, after providing the right actions or after evaluating the effects of the actions? In our case, the budget and the responsibility for the actions, or interventions if you will, lie within the business. They should follow up on the actions and evaluate them periodically. Having said that we are thinking about increasing our effort in the first year after a research to provide more support on evaluations and… to remember our business on their initial commitment. </p>, <p>Related to “go beyond statistics” I encourage you to experiment more with the different modern, powerful and cool (cloud-based) tools that are available. SAS, SPSS, R et cetera are great and very useful. But as mentioned in one of my previous posts (<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-big-thing-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">The next big thing in HR analytics</a>) there are more tools available on the market that more and more are merging powerful data mining techniques, data transformation techniques, strong data visualizations with a user friendly self-service interface. Although coding can be minimized by using these types of tools you will still need an expert to use it. I am not in favor of ‘black box’ analytics. You should always be able to understand the choices behind the models and be able to export code to check or optimize your model. Nevertheless these new tools allow you to explore your data more quickly and speed up your time-to-insight. Some tools are even suitable to show to your business because of the powerful user interface. We are currently using <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/company/1742510?trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Acompany%2CclickedEntityId%3A1742510%2Cidx%3A2-1-2%2CtarId%3A1474050244430%2Ctas%3Abigml"" target=""_blank"">BigML</a> and are starting to look into <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/watson-analytics/us-en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Watson Analytics</a> (IBM). But there are more tools out there, just check out the Gartner Magic Quadrant 2016 on advanced analytical platforms. I expect Gartner to include more tools in 2017 like BigML, Dataiku, Dato, H2O, Rapid Insight, Skytree and TIBCO.</p>, <p>We do not start any project without approval from legal and compliance. Furthermore we show legal our results before going to our business. Of course anonymity of individual data is key. And in our case various types of data like health or email data are out of limit. But another very important aspect of this type of research is the goal or intention of the research. What are you going to investigate and with what purpose? The end results will be evaluated against the initial goal of the research. In our experience, legal is a true partner in our analytical journey. We are challenged and supported on issues like anonymity of data, latest (international) legislation on privacy, contracts with vendors and their compliancy with local and European regulations. Our advice is to get legal on board as soon as possible.</p>, <p>Doing analytics should not be underestimated. Analytics, although you can start small, demands discipline and it may take a while before you agree on the research question and model, before you receive the right data, before you connect the datasets and before you checked data quality and cleaned the data. These steps take approximately 75% of the whole research project. Once this is done you can relatively quickly run the models and interpret the results. A wise thing to do is not to give a final delivery date before you received all the datasets (we had one painful experience). And do plan some extra time for analyses after receiving the first results. You probably want to do some extra analyses before you finalize your results and go to the business. We recognize four steps in our approach. </p>, <p>Teaching the HR community about the principles of HR analytics is of course very important and also fun. We use workshops, summer courses and social media (internal) to preach and teach on HR analytics. Currently we are preparing our first HR analytics Lab. The idea is to invite a specific HR business line or group of experts (e.g recruitment) and to ask them what they would like to know. During the Lab session we will explore the (prepared) data with the help of BigML and experiment and explore the data together. This will suit two goals, creating immediate insights and creating more awareness and knowledge of the opportunities of HR analytics. I will let you know next time if we were successful. Then do not forget to train your analytical team. Again, we learn a lot by summits, social media, reading the latest books and articles and last year we decided to attend some lectures on data mining and algorithms. Besides this we participate in several roundtables or boards focussed on HR analytics where we share thoughts, views and best practices with peer organizations. All this keeps us up to date on the latest trends in HR analytics. Don’t forget to share your research results, besides with your customer, with relevant HR experts within recruitment, talent development, reward, learning and so on. Preach the benefits of analytics to everyone who might benefit or wants to hear it. </p>, <p>Based on my experience as a practitioner, only those organizations that manage to create and maintain a balanced blend of different relevant capabilities will be successful in HR analytics. You need to create a team that understands your business challenges, HR processes and IT (hardware and software). And last but not least your team should have impeccable analytical and consultancy skills. By the way ‘your team’ can also consist of external resources from a vendor. An overarching capability that is important to do analytics is curiosity and having an inquiring mind-set. This is true not only for your analytical department but also for the rest of HR. And you will need a few integrators or translators that are able to combine all perspectives above and create a common understanding on HR analytics within your organization. All these capabilities are captured in the HR analytics capability wheel. For more details on the HR analytics wheel please read my previous post “<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/practitioners-view-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">A practitioner’s view on HR analytics</a>” (also by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/auke-ijsselstein-8186055?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=ZjiG&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A16432724%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1474049922139%2Ctas%3Aauke%20ij"" target=""_blank"">Auke IJsselstein</a>). </p>, <p>Building on the previous rule. Implementing HR analytics is important but of course only a part of the puzzle if you want to create a fact-based HR organization. For me a fact-based HR organization means doing the utmost to evaluate and prove the effectiveness of your HR products and policies when it comes to supporting your business goals. Recruiters should investigate if their hires are still successfully with the company after a few years. Learning specialist should wonder if their training interventions are actually contributing to the learning goals and business performance. Reward specialists should think about the effect of reward and benefit plans on engagement, attrition and individual performance. HR business partners should continuously be working on the question “Is our workforce fit-for-purpose when it comes to achieving business success”. The answers to all these questions can lie within HR analytics but not often also by simply measuring and evaluating key performance indicators, calculating cost versus benefits (ROI), collecting new relevant data or starting a project on strategic workforce planning. This intrinsic curiosity and fact-based thinking is not the dominant culture of current HR organizations. We need a revolution in HR to move the needle towards a more data-driven way of working. </p>, <p>It is not about HR analytics but about enterprise analytics. How can advanced analytics best support your organizational goals? In some organizations it is perfectly fine to have a decentralized perspective of advanced analytics with local data, local scientists and local or cloud-based IT platforms. But for some organizations it might be extremely useful to move from a decentralized (domain-driven) perspective towards an enterprise perspective on advanced analytics. The enterprise wide view on advanced analytics, allows the organization to share and integrate data (for example from HR, finance, marketing and clients), combine analysts and build a joined corporate IT platform (‘Analytics at Work’ by Davenport, Harris and Morison). My expectation is that larger organizations will move to some form of enterprise analytics because of the economics of scale and increased opportunities to find insights because of a truly enterprise-wide data-cube.</p>, <p><strong>Contributors</strong></p>, <p>Beside all the excellent peers and experts that influenced me, I want to conclude with a list of people that took the time and effort to provide me with some great comments and constructive feedback on previous posts in the past via LinkedIn.

The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,People Analytics: What’s in it for the employee?,6. Andrew Marritt,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-whats-employees-andrew-marritt?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>Early in life I developed a love for microeconomics. All of my electives at uni were micro or mathematical economics based. At the time this was unfashionable but over the last 15 years it’s risen in stature.</p>, <p>Microeconomics is all about understanding how people react to incentives. When we’re doing People Analytics we’re not dealing with numbers generated by some machine, we’re dealing with information created by people dealing with the constraints they’re facing as they try and find their best solution. To be a good analyst you always have to understand incentives.</p>, <p>It’s worth understanding that in organizations there will never be a complete alignment between the organization’s incentives and those of the individual. Assuming what is right for the business will also be right for the individual is dangerous. Therefore it’s right that we consider explicitly individual-level incentives and identify ways that these can be harnessed to increase the value to the organization.</p>, <p><strong>What’s in it for me?</strong></p>, <p>People often ask me what is the most important thing is to doing great People Analytics. The answer is simple - <strong>trust</strong>. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data.</p>, <p>Too often I see HR rushing into analysis thinking only (a) what can they do to improve the business (b) how can they improve their own lives. Whilst the first one is important, critical even, it’s always important to think about what’s in it for the employees. </p>, <p>People Analytics teams always need to be in a position where they are comfortable explaining what they’re doing to the employees. I personally think we can hold our heads high with the work we’re doing. In many instances we’re looking for information to make better, more objective decisions. We’re using data to reduce bias.</p>, <p>Give people a choice between acting in the best interest of their employer and acting in their own best interest and most of the time they’ll pick the latter. Of course sometimes the two are aligned but this isn’t always true.</p>, <p>With any decision there are likely to be winners and losers. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Prospect theory</a> suggests that those who are going to lose out will be more vocal than those who will benefit. Those whose careers have been built on politics will feel threatened by moving to an objective world.</p>, <p>However, this isn’t a reason to not being objective. Company’s can afford to be more objective. It’s right to try and maximise the overall benefit for all stakeholders.</p>, <p>For any People Analytics work to be sustainable (and thus maximising the benefit over time) it needs to benefit <em>all</em> stakeholders. You’ll need employees to help give you great quality data. To do this you have to ensure they can see why it’s in their <em>own</em> personal interest.</p>, <p>The vast proportion of our analytics projects can be explained as being good for employees. Attrition modelling is all about reducing the economic cost of people leaving. People leave because they’re unhappy. You can only reduce attrition by increasing this happiness.</p>, <p>We can think of other topics. Sickness, health &amp; safety (reducing accidents), increasing customer experience, better alignment of teams, diversity, employee experience. What is good for the employer is almost always good for the overall employee population. However the question will often need to be reframed to make this explicit.</p>, <p>People Analytics teams need to be proud of what they’re doing. They should communicate what they’re doing in as open a way as possible. They should engage with works councils where these exist.</p>, <p>If you don’t do this your work won’t be sustainable. You should assume that employees will find out what you’re doing with their data. It’s better for you to tell them in advance. It’s important to build trust.</p>, <p><strong>How thinking about employees’ incentives means better data</strong></p>, <p>Data acquisition is a fundamental part of any analysis work, and in many instances you will rely on employees providing that data. Again, if you want your work to be sustainable you need to think about what’s in it for them to support the initiative.</p>, <p>Again, we have a split between what is in the company’s interest, and what are the incentives for the employee. Unless you consider the latter, and build a convincing case for them personally benefiting, you won’t get great quality data.</p>, <p>For those who are entering the data as part of their job maybe the incentives are aligned. For many other instances there has to be a good reason why someone should provide data.</p>, <p>One of the models we use to describe how improving incentive alignment can improve analysis we call the Virtuous Circle of Data Quality. This describes how employees will contribute more information, or take better care with providing information, if they feel that the analysis provides benefits to them.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One area close to my heart is when asking for feedback. Employees are clearly motivated to provide feedback if they feel that their feedback will make a difference. We see this from both engaged employees - who care deeply about an organization and want tit to improve - and disengaged employees - who want to tell you what’s not working.</p>, <p>It’s worth thinking, however, how you can take this further by providing individual-level reporting. One early proponent of this is Towers Watson who offer <a href=""http://www.towerswatson.com/en-US/Services/Services/individual-engagement-reports"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">individual engagement reports</a>. Their implementation seems very similar to how psychometric test developers often provide reporting to test participants (an almost identical incentive problem). I think this is a great first step. I suspect that user-centred design combined with advanced analytics is the way to build upon this approach.</p>, <p><strong>Help people meet their objectives</strong></p>, <p>The explosion of workforce data has created great opportunities for helping individuals to manage their work in ways that help meet their own personal goals. As analysts and technology providers we need to now build tools that meet this need.</p>, <p>As people analytics evolved we’ve matured from solving problems which were of most interest to HR teams to addressing issues that met business objectives. The next phase will be about providing tools that enable individuals to meet their objectives, even if their objectives aren't explicitly the same as the organisations'.</p>, <p>We could think about using recommender systems to provide advice, both in terms of identifying knowledge or proposing contacts and networks. We could be thinking about how people like them manage their careers or realise more value from the vast amount of non-pay benefits that are often available, but not well known within organizations.</p>, <p>What is common across almost all of these potential solutions is that (a) there needs to be a recognition that employees’ and organizations’ incentives don’t perfectly align and (b) they use technology, data and analysis to reduce friction including search costs.</p>, <p>Analysis becomes sustainable when it addresses the needs of multiple stakeholders. HR teams should ask themselves the question of 'what's in it for the employees?' If they can answer this question effectively it greatly increases the chance of success.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>, <p>Andrew is one of the pioneers of the European People Analytics scene.

The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,Empower your employees to leverage their own data,18. Kathleen Hogan,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/empower-your-employees-leverage-own-data-kathleen-hogan?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>Having spent time last week in the realities of business analytics at the <a href=""http://www.peopleanalyticsconference.com/agenda/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wharton People Analytics Conference</a>, I’m more convinced than ever that data can transform the way we experience work.</p>, <p>Big data has become a commonplace term, and it was only a matter of time before companies figured out that in a world where everything can be measured—from your steps to the office to your keystrokes per day—evaluating a company’s most significant resource investment, its people, would reach the forefront of the discussion.</p>, <p>We’re certainly talking about this at Microsoft, and looking at some really interesting correlations that show how employees and teams can be more productive. In today’s digital workplace, it’s possible to get data about things like time spent in meetings, email volumes, response times, interactions with peer networks, and even office environments. Teams and individuals can then use those insights to identify the habits and behaviors that help them be most productive.</p>, <p>This is where you might step back and go, <em>wait a minute, hold the phone. Employees are okay with this?</em></p>, <p>The short answer is “yes.”</p>, <p>But here’s the long answer too.</p>, <p>We expect this data to empower—not undermine—employee decision making. If you give employees value by providing access to their productivity metrics, they’ll find they’re vested and energized to improve those metrics. You’re essentially offering employees insight on the most productive aspect of their days.</p>, <p>Our ultimate goal is to create the ability for employees to own their data, improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance. And I know from experience that happy, efficient employees are more collaborative, innovative, and loyal.</p>, <p><strong>Turning data into productivity</strong></p>, <p>At Microsoft, we believe building a true digital, data-driven enterprise requires organizations to empower and connect their people across everything —people, processes, data, and systems. That’s why we’ve introduced Delve Analytics in Office 365, and made it available to all of our employees. Delve Analytics gives every employee their own personal dashboard with insights into their work patterns – things like how much time they spend in meetings, writing and responding to emails, and connecting with the colleagues who have the biggest impact on their work.</p>, <p>We’re putting the power of data in the hands of our people—literally information at their fingertips to help employees understand how they spend their time and who they spend it with, so they can make meaningful improvements.</p>, <p>It’s important to point out that these dashboards are completely confidential to each individual. The employee is the only person with access to their personal dashboard, and nobody else can see it—not their manager, not HR, not IT.</p>, <p>We believe this system places us on the leading edge of a new world of work. Imagine a world where employees use their personal data to chart the career path that’s right for them and the company. A world where organizational agility, response rates to managers, and even personal network growth over time are quantifiable and people willingly share this information to help influence job interview and performance reviews. Not only <em>can</em> it happen, it’s <em>going</em> to happen.</p>, <p>I encourage you to think more about how to use the petabytes of data available to your organization to help empower employees to make their decisions about how to improve efficiency. You’ll be amazed at the results you can drive when employees have visibility and impact on their own data.</p>]"

The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,How do you transform HRBPs into “consumers of analytics”?,22. Saskia Menke,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-you-transform-hrbps-consumers-analytics-saskia-menke?trk=hp-feed-article-title-share,"[<p>Recently we, the Human Capital Analytics (HCA) Group at Copenhagen Business School, held our first HCA Hackathon on the topic of how to engage Human Resource Business Partners (HRPBs) into human capital analytics projects. The event was a great success and our participants were able to come up with very interesting solutions. Read more about the case and the proposed solutions below.</p>, <p><strong>What challenge were we dealing with?</strong></p>, <p>The case challenge dealt with a mid-size company that has a HRBP structure and a HR analytics team consisting of one senior analyst, two analysts and one student assistant. They cover various different topics from employer branding over leadership development to diversity and inclusion but, as a result, sometimes cannot tell the difference between the HR analytics topics.</p>, <p>Through the analysis of the <a href=""http://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-strategic-management-and-globalization/human-capital-analytics/ongoing-research/an-evaluation-of-your-companys-hca-status"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">“HCA Profile”</a> tool, we were able to identify that throughout the time we have accompanied them, they have improved greatly on their data quality and analytical competencies. However, at the same time, they lost focus in their strategic ability to act.</p>, <p>One of the problems they are currently facing is their long history of operational reporting. They are receiving a multitude of low value-added requests and now ask themselves whether they should be choosier in their services and move away from a service center to a consultative partnership. Moreover, there is a general low capability of frontline HR to digest true analytics. Finally, they want to figure out how to make HR analytics a driver of value creation in HR. Since advanced analytics still requires the “proof of value” to be recognized, they want to link analytics to the whole HR value chain analytics.</p>, <p>The participants of the HCA Hackathon were asked to analyze the case challenge and come up with solutions to the various issues addressed.</p>, <p>Among the various solutions created by the participants of the HCA Hackathon the following were stressed:</p>, <p><strong>1. Strategic Value Creation</strong></p>, <p>In order to make HR analytics a driver of value creation in HR, it is important to align HR KPIs with the overall business strategy of an organization to set a direction and ensure projects contribute to value creation. In this way, HRBPs are more likely to recognize the importance of HR analytics. It is highly recommended to quantify the changes and impacts HR analytics have on an organization to document its importance and to be able to justify the need for it. Incorporating HR analytics into annual business reviews and organizational audit reports further ensures the alignment with the overall strategy.</p>, <p><strong>2. The HR Analytics Function</strong></p>, <p>The HR analytics function has to be attentive to both its work content as well as its structure. First, the function has to deal with its operational reporting. It has to pay more attention to strategic rather than non-strategic reporting and thus prioritize projects and requests. Moving forward and doing more advanced analytics requires cutting down operational reporting. A way of doing this could, for example, be by outsourcing some of these more operational requests or by moving to self-service reporting through HRBPs and directors. Additionally, the function needs to align and standardize the format of flow of its HR insights, to facilitate the information transfer to HRBPs.</p>, <p>Second, to be able to move away from just being a service center, the HR analytics function has to be reorganized within the organization and start reporting directly to the CHRO. Moreover, to tackle the issue of low capabilities within the function, a continuous internal evaluation can help to identify the own capacities and its limits. One interesting way of extending a function’s capabilities is to engage more actively with industrial PhDs, student assistants and interns who can bring up-to-date academic knowledge into the HR analytics team by rotating them through the team.</p>, <p><strong>3. Reaching Out</strong></p>, <p>Although the answer to the question of how to transform HRBPs into ‘consumers of analytics’ lies to a great extent within the HR analytics function, its external environment should not be left unnoticed. First of all, it is of upmost importance to create more internal communication to other HR functions in order to make analytics more visible and a driver of value creation in HR. Moreover, if the goal is to engage HRBPs more extensively in HR analytics and make HR analytics a more important issue for the entire organization, good relationships and even partnerships with HRBPs and the overall business management are crucial. At the same time, the capability to digest true analytics at times extends to HRBPs. In this case, the capabilities of HRBPs must be assessed and educated if needed. They can only become ‘consumers of analytics’ if they are able to understand the topic in its thoroughness.</p>, <p><strong>A final comment</strong></p>, <p>Two final critical comments should be made with respect to the solutions listed above. First, we have been talking a lot about prioritizing projects and at the same time building partnerships and engaging HRBPs. A critical issue that should be kept in mind, however, is how to cut down on ‘low’ value requests when they are considered valuable and must-have by HRBPs without alienating them?</p>, <p>Second, while the overall aim was to transform HRBPs into the ‘consumers of analytics’, we might have to revise the role we generally tend to ascribe to HRBPs in the first place. We often tend to see them as “superheroes” that are expected to know everything and if they don’t, their skills need to be upscaled or they need to get out. However, can we really expect them to know all this? Do we even have to educate them at all? And finally, do they actually need to be those superheroes or should it be more the job of HR analytics to properly translate results?</p>, <p>These critical comments are intended to question the recommendations made above and to assess which are applicable to your own organization. After all, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to HR analytics.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>We would like to hear your own experience on this topic and look forward to reading them!</p>, <p>If you want to learn more about how to work with HRBPs and improve your HCA function contact us at hc-analytics@cbs.dk.</p>, <p>All information regarding the HCA Hackathon 2017 and other events can be found on <a href=""http://www.cbs.dk/hc-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.cbs.dk/hc-analytics</a>.</p>]"

The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,What teaching People Analytics has taught me about teaching People Analytics,29. Sam Hill,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-teaching-people-analytics-has-taught-me-part-1-sam-hill?trk=hp-feed-article-title-like,"[<p>When introducing and overviewing my ‘Practical People Analytics’ workshop, I’m inclined to say content is reflective of every lesson learnt – and every mistake made – while conducting advisory and educational engagements. And so it is.</p>, <p>Finally, having repeated that mantra for almost ten years, and to reinforce a commitment to building a community of highly skilled and analytically focused HR practitioners, this is a summary of what teaching People Analytics has taught me about teaching People Analytics.</p>, <p><strong>It is vital to differentiate between Reporting and Analytics</strong></p>, <p>People reporting is a venerable art; vital in its own right and as a foundation for people analytics – but it isn’t analytics.</p>, <p>Reporting tells us what’s happened; analysis and analytics tells us why it happened, what will happen next and what we can do to mitigate risk or maximise opportunity.</p>, <p>As educators, if we want to raise the level of debate around analytics, we must differentiate it from reporting.</p>, <p>Furthermore, whilst acknowledging that there are regular analytical journeys, rather like paths across a muddy field which can be retraced to great effect by the budding analyst; really innovative People Analytics relies on a mind-set that puts curiosity and context ahead of process.</p>, <p><strong>It is our responsibility to help delegates identify Value Add opportunities</strong></p>, <p>Essentially investigations that have the potential to generate insight, about something that is important, with a business context; insight that could inform a workforce or business decision.</p>, <p>This may relate to a current or emerging people issue, the effectiveness of a key HR process or something that helps us understand the workforce’s contribution to the execution of organisational strategy.</p>, <p>To encourage too much of anything else is to encourage trivia.</p>, <p>Frustratingly within many organisations, trivial people analysis, like a cheap buffet at a wedding reception, is still consumed – because it’s there and because it’s ‘free’. The test (one I face, of course, as a fee for service consultant) is whether anyone would actually pay hard cash for your product - we have to help practitioners create and demonstrate value.</p>, <p><strong>Don’t belittle HR intuition; embrace it</strong></p>, <p>Rather than rejecting or ignoring ‘HR intuition’ we should embrace it as a potential starting point for our investigations – essentially as a hypothesis.</p>, <p>If analysis proves a hypothesis to be true, great – we’ve got valuable insight to offer to the business – if it’s proved false, then nothing ventured nothing gained, and we may have debunked a myth.</p>, <p>HR ‘gut feel’ is not the answer, but I’m convinced it’s a valid input into a process that will ask the right question.</p>, <p><strong>Use Anecdotes to illustrate the Art of the Possible</strong></p>, <p>There is a quote from Mario Cuomo that goes something like this “we campaign in poetry, but we govern in prose”. He was referring to the world of politics, but I believe the same sentiment can be applied to People Analytics.</p>, <p>In my experience, over and above frameworks and methodologies, the anecdote or the war story that presents a genuine business based scenario – usually a thorny workforce issue – and describes how this was tackled using people analytics is the best way to engage a delegate group. This is the poetry.</p>, <p>We can then embed the learning through classroom discussion and individual or group exercises; the prose.</p>, <p><strong>We Share, We Learn</strong></p>, <p>Finally, and going off at a slight, tangent, I was delighted to be at the CIPD HR Analytics Conference in London last week; these events are a great place to hear the anecdotes, challenges, success stories and peccadillos of others.</p>, <p>One excellent point made by Maja Luckos (Capgemini) during her presentation was the importance of generously sharing knowledge across the discipline of People Analytics (“think and act open-source”).</p>, <p>This is so important; I actively encourage those who attend Workforce Dimensions courses to join conferences, events and online communities to further advance their learning. Not only that, but also to share their learning with, and celebrate the success of others.</p>, <p>In this respect (if you are not doing so already) I strongly advise you follow David Green; as well as offering excellent content of his own, he carefully curates and generously shares and promotes the content of others.

The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,"Defining Talent Analytics: Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive",30. Ben Eubanks,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/defining-talent-analytics-descriptive-predictive-ben-eubanks,"[<p>According to the latest from Deloitte's Human Capital Trends study, 77% of executives now rate people analytics as a key business priority, and half of companies are now correlating business impact to HR programs. About four in ten firms are now trying to predict business performance with workforce data, up from 29% last year. </p>, <p>Last week I had a dozen serious, thought-provoking conversations for work, and at least half of them revolved around analytics. This topic is gaining traction, and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/laymans-guide-using-predictive-hr-analytics-ben-eubanks"" target=""_blank"">HR leaders need to get better about understanding how they work, even if it isn't their core competency</a>. Before I get into exploring the types of analytics, I want to tell a story that illustrates a common use case. In my research, I have found that one of the common challenges to acceptance and adoption of analytics for talent leaders is a lack of connectivity--they have a hard time understanding how the tools will help them.</p>, <p>One of the technology companies I spoke with has the ability to show in just a few seconds what information/inputs/variables are driving outcomes. And it goes beyond simple correlation (knowing that factor A has a relationship with factor B). It actually shows causation (knowing that factor A <strong>actually causes</strong> factor B). But even cooler than that, it can give you a ranked list of variables that shows which ones have the most influence on the outcome. And the best part? This analysis can be done by someone like me (or you) in just minutes.</p>, <p>Here's an example to make it more clear:</p>, <p>Let's say you throw a bunch of people data into the system, hoping it will tell you which of your team members are most likely to turn over. The tool will instantly create a model and bring back predictions on who is most likely to leave along with the specific signals for each person that contribute to their likelihood to depart.</p>, <p>For instance, Bob might be more likely because he has received two poor performance reviews in a row, but Mary might be more likely because she has taken six unscheduled sick days and her engagement scores on this year's survey were down significantly.</p>, <p>That's just one example, but it shows you how granular these tools are becoming in their outputs. No longer do you get a ""black box"" or inexplicable answer of ""Bob is 72.5% likely to leave"" without any explanation of the contributing factors or their relative weights in the decision.</p>, <p>The biggest benefit, in my opinion?</p>, <p>Now, let's jump into the types of analytics and explore the value and significance of each.</p>, <p>Descriptive analytics are the most simple type of data. These simply aggregate data points for easier consumption. When you think about the raw data, there's no way to make sense of the information when it could be tens of thousands or even millions of data points. So descriptive analytics are used to pull out trends and <strong>describe</strong> some of the commonalities in the data.</p>, <p>Dr. Michael Wu, a chief data scientist, estimates that 80% of analytics used in business today are descriptive. This can include anything from historical reasons people left your organization to the most common hiring sources.</p>, <p>While there's nothing inherently wrong with descriptive analytics, they are not as powerful for guiding future decisions. That's where predictive comes into play.</p>, <p>As described in my previous piece, the <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/post/edit/laymans-guide-using-predictive-hr-analytics-ben-eubanks"" target=""_blank"">laymen's guide to predictive analytics</a>, once we have enough data we can create models that can be used to predict changes in specific causal variables. <strong>In English: once we know how two things are tied together, we can predict changes in one by making changes to the other. </strong>This is also commonly referred to as a ""what if"" analysis, because it allows users to explore what happens if they choose a particular path or make a specific decision.</p>, <p>For example, once I know that sales training is tied to sales volume, I can predict how much sales will change based on increasing or decreasing training.</p>, <p>Another good use case is the scenario I explored above regarding intent to stay/depart.</p>, <p>Predictive analytics uses a variety of methods, including modeling, machine learning, and more to study historical data and create more accurate predictions of the future. Note: those are <strong>predictions</strong>, not <strong>reality</strong>. This is sophisticated forecasting and can illuminate likely outcomes, but it is purely based on probability.</p>, <p>One of the most pressing challenges I hear from HR leaders is that they might be able to analyze data and possibly even create some predictions, but then they get stuck. That's where prescriptive analytics comes in. Beyond just illuminating likely outcomes, as we discussed in the section on predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics can recommend multiple courses of action and the likely outcomes of each decision.</p>, <p>The power here is that the system can sift through potential directions and offer (prescribe) the ones that that make the most sense. Again, it's about shortening the gap from data to action.</p>, <p>Prescriptive goes beyond predictive analytics, because in addition to the shared data model, it requires actionable data and a way to feed data back into the system to track outcomes. It can also be more powerful than predictive analytics, especially for those that might need help choosing the correct route.</p>, <p>Prescriptive analytics try to define the outcomes of future decisions in order to advise on possible outcomes before the decisions are made. In theory, prescriptive analytics predict not only what will happen, but also <strong>why</strong> it will happen, offering recommendations on how to take advantage of the predictions.</p>, <p>A use case for prescriptive analytics would be to optimize scheduling for employees for the best sales/revenue and customer service scores. By asking the system which is the optimum mix, you can see various outcomes as well as the one (prescribed) that would lead to the best sales and customer service outcomes. Think about the power of this type of analytics.</p>, <p>As a talent leader, it's important that you ""get"" talent analytics, whether descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive. You need to understand the underlying principles for how they work, because they can provide immense value to the business (note that I said ""business,"" not just value for HR itself). What if you could predict hiring needs, turnover numbers, or the impact of pay decisions on productivity? And more importantly, if you could then determine likely outcomes and select the one that delivers the most value to the business?</p>, <p>The tools and technology are becoming more user friendly, allowing those of us without advanced statistical training to analyze data and make decisions to improve talent and business outcomes.</p>, <p><em>Is your organization using analytics? What has been the biggest barrier to implementation? </em></p>, <p>For additional articles in this series on analytics, be sure to check out:</p>]"

The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,Google Game Changer is changing HIS Game,32. Darren Kaplan,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-game-changer-changing-his-darren-grant-kaplan?published=t,"[<p>Last week, Business Insider reported that Laszlo Bock, SVP of People Operations at Google, was stepping down after 10 years. Knowing what they had in Bock, Google was reluctant to let him get away completely.  This may explain why he’s now listed as a Senior Advisor at Google. Business Insider also reported that he’ll now be acting as an advisor to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and working with other companies, something we’ve heard he’s passionate about doing.</p>, <p>Bock has been a game changer in the People Analytics space, influencing the way companies look at hiring and retaining talent.  This has been true both at Google itself and, through the conversations he’s sparked, the book he’s written, and the blogs and news coverage in which he’s shared his ideas, a much greater span of industries. This moment gives us a prime opportunity to mark 10 years of the man and his influence, and to thank him for changing the way HR uses data to make decisions. We want to wish him continued success in spreading the word.</p>, <p><strong>What he did for People Analytics</strong></p>, <p>His own Linkedin profile says it well. In leading Google’s people function –attracting, training and retaining talent – Bock says he “believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy.” Considering people spend more time working than doing anything else, he believes it is wrong that so often the work experience is “demotivating and dehumanizing.”</p>, <p>Freedom. Science. Over time, that philosophy developed into a culture of employee care, of building a workplace where people wanted to spend time, of hiring people almost guaranteed to succeed and then making sure they would never want to leave. From free gourmet food and snacks, to algorithm-based hiring and retention, to rethinking the Google interview process, Googlers are made to feel at home while at work. Bock believes his strategies for People Analytics success rest with the data. What do employees want?  Ask the data. Who are the best candidates?  Ask the data.  How can we identify who will appreciate what we offer, value what we value, and in the end, contribute to our culture and success?  Ask the data.</p>, <p>If you think these kinds of initiatives and strategies don’t make a difference, think again. During Bock’s time with the company, Google has received more than 100 awards as an employer of choice and has been named the ‘Best Company to Work For’ around the world more than 30 times. He was clearly doing something right.</p>, <p>Bock and his team have created a new space for the employer/ employee relationship to co-exist with data, and with that, new possibilities for engagement, work-life balance, and happiness in the work environment.</p>, <p>That, really, is the biggest gift Bock has given us: that cross pollination of beliefs, that sharing of ideas, passed from him to those he has worked with, to those who have read his book or picked up on his blogs. While few of us will actually work for Google, those who have drunk from the cup of People Analytics that he offers are now taking his beliefs into other fields, spreading the golden glow of possibility.  In time, they will lead others in the industry to follow suit.  </p>, <p>Bock has already inspired a new generation of leaders who believe that people decisions should be based on data, rather than solely on gut feel. Look at JP Morgan’s Global People Analytics Leader, Ian O’Keefe, Facebooks’ Director of People Insights, Scott Judd;  and Twitter's Shane McCauley all are former Googlers.</p>, <p>Or look to Evan Wittenberg, SVP of People at Box, or Arnnon Geshuri, Vice President of Human Resources at Tesla, for their strategies and successes. Previously Director of Staffing Operations at Google, Geshuri is credited with designing Google’s recruitment organization and talent acquisition strategies, among other successes.</p>, <p>All of this is to say that Bock has influenced – for the better– the way employers hire talent, and the commitment they make to keeping people happy. He has not only set Googlers up for success, he has created an ecosystem of ideas that will take that success forward to new companies. His success is backed by evidence that will support the uptake of these game changing strategies by new industries, and by others looking for better ways to work.</p>, <p>Between the ripple effect of what he has already done, and his new focus on working with more companies, I think this is just the start; the best is yet to come. Laszlo, thank you. Can’t wait to see what happens next.</p>, <p>For the rest of us, it’s time to get into the game and use People Analytics to drive talent innovation in our companies.</p>, <p> Darren Kaplan</p>, <p>CEO, Co-Founder</p>, <p>hiQ Labs</p>, <p> <a href=""http://www.hiqlabs.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.hiqlabs.com</a> </p>]"
The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,"People Analytics – Show me, don’t tell me",Ben Teusch,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-show-me-dont-tell-ben-teusch,"[<p>Over the past couple of years, I've gone from being an economics major with an interest in social psychology to starting a career in the emerging people analytics field. I owe much of that transition, as well as much of my people analytics knowledge, to the hundreds of articles I’ve found on LinkedIn and Twitter, as well as the writers who took the time to publish them. Their willingness to share insights allowed me to see what people analytics was, is, and can be; who is doing it; what kind of people and teams do it well; and how to be successful as a people analytics leader within an organization.</p>, <p>As I continue reading today, I continue to find more articles on those topics, as well as a rich discussion within the people analytics community about psychology topics (should we measure employee engagement?), business topics (which business leader should a people analytics team report to?), and ethical concerns (how do we make sure people analytics reduces bias, and doesn't inadvertently increase it?).</p>, <p>These articles seem to be targeting two audiences. The first audience is made up of HR and business leaders who may have heard about people analytics and would be interested to learn <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-takes-off-ten-things-weve-learned-josh-bersin"" target=""_blank"">how popular it is</a>, who else is using it, and what kind of problems could be solved with people analytics. Some articles are also “excitement articles,” as <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/richardrosenow"" target=""_blank"">Richard Rosenow</a> <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-starter-kit-part-1-richard-rosenow-pmp?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">referred to them</a>. These help evangelize people analytics and get HR and business leaders excited to try what is still new and untested in many organizations.</p>, <p>Excitement articles also target the second audience – people analytics leaders. They are energized by these type of articles, especially while they are still building their team. People analytics leaders are interested in solving their own problems – how to People analytics leaders are interested in solving their own problems – how to <a href=""http://www.talentanalytics.com/blog/the-beginners-guide-to-predictive-workforce-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">gain credibility</a> with business leaders, what questions to answer first, which <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/practitioners-view-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">skills they should make sure are on their team</a>, and how to move from analysis to implementation. These leaders may not have both a strong HR and technical background, but they are capable of doing the analysis necessary. Their focus lies beyond the technical details.</p>, <p>Occasionally I find articles, sprinkled in among the rest, that target a third audience. This audience includes two subgroups: people in HR who have little first-hand knowledge of statistical techniques, but know what questions they want to answer and could “get it” with a solid example; and people who came through more technical backgrounds, but don’t yet know what kind of data HR has to deal with or what kinds of questions would be best to answer. People in this audience might read an article on people analytics, and want to try something similar, but don’t know how to get started without a little more detail. They're saying, through more technical backgrounds, but don’t yet know what kind of data HR has to deal with or what kinds of questions would be best to answer. People in this audience might read an article on people analytics, and want to try something similar, but don’t know how to get started without a little more detail. They're saying, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtpMeyjE6Rw"" target=""_blank"">""show me, don't tell me!""</a></p>, <p>Articles for this audience don't explain people analytics at the macro level, but at the micro level, giving explanations of which kinds of analyses are useful for people analytics, as well as how to run them. Richard touches on the lack of articles for this audience, and provides <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-starter-kit-part-2-intro-r-richard-rosenow-pmp"" target=""_blank"">the few examples</a> he’s been able to find, including several turnover-focused examples in <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analyzing-employee-turnover-predictive-methods-richard-rosenow-pmp?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">another article</a>. Two other posts I would mention here are less how-to guides and more explanations: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeroendelmotte"" target=""_blank"">Jeroen Delmotte</a> from iNostix by Deloitte put together a <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/blog/en/hr-reporting-can-be-very-misleading/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">concrete example</a> of when it is necessary to use regression analysis instead of summary statistics in HR, and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/bentaylordata"" target=""_blank"">Ben Taylor</a> from HireVue explained <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5th-grade-data-science-nlp-computers-text-benjamin-taylor-data-?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">natural language processing in a simple way</a>, again with an HR data example. That’s not a bad sampling, but it’s nothing compared to the deluge of articles that allowed David Green to put together a “best of” list of them that reached <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/27-best-hr-analytics-articles-h1-2016-david-green?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">27 articles</a> – just from the last 6 months! </p>, <p>A big reason is the sensitive nature of the work done in people analytics. Practitioners are rarely permitted to share even the results of internal analyses publicly, let alone the methodology used to get them. This sensitivity regarding employee data, even at an aggregate level, is laudable insofar as it protects the employees we serve, but we can probably do a better job of sharing information generally. For example, which kind of analyses are working and which ones are not, and for which questions, or data cleaning techniques that help deal with clunky HRIS data. <a href=""http://hros.co/case-studies/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Open Source</a> also has good examples of sharing successful HR efforts in a way that doesn’t compromise employee privacy.</p>, <p>A second reason is that HR is using very few techniques that aren’t <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hrs-last-mover-advantage-predictive-analytics-richard-rosenow-pmp?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">used elsewhere</a>. Writing up an example of how to use regression analysis to understand performance drivers might feel redundant when entire series of textbooks have been devoted to regression analysis. But even though examples of these techniques are already widely available, you have to know where to look for them. That requires that you be both fairly technically skilled <strong>and</strong> knowledgeable about HR to know how to apply that technique – but I think people analytics still faces a shortage of people like that.</p>, <p>A good place to start would be with some examples of HR problems that analytics could solve – then the community could put together examples of how to answer them in a methodical, detailed way. Manoj Kumar <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-master-crowdsourced-lists-hr-analytics-you-ever-needed-manoj-kumar?trk=hp-feed-article-title-comment"" target=""_blank"">recently proposed </a>a crowdsourced list of dummy HR data and codes for people analytics (see bullet 10). And <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> recently published a list of examples of <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/13-people-analytics-ideas-get-you-started-tracey-smith?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">problems analytics could solve in HR</a>. Sharing the tools and methods that would help solve those kinds of problems would be a perfect place to start. I’ve started work on finding data and getting it to a point that I could demonstrate how to tackle some of these types of questions – I hope some of you will join me. Let’s add to the articles written on who, what, where, and why with a few good articles that describe the all-important <strong>how.</strong> </p>, <p>As I come across articles that serve the third audience, I'll put them here. Please share any you find with me, and I'll add them.</p>]"
The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,In People Analytics Our Greatest Opportunities Also Define Our Greatest Challenge,Ryan Hammond,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-our-greatest-opportunities-also-define-ryan-hammond?trk=hp-feed-article-title-comment,"[<p>One of the best parts of my job is getting the opportunity to meet people analytics leaders and team members to hear about their successes. In October, we will be celebrating many of these successes at the <a href=""http://web.hiqlabs.com/elevate-1/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Elevate awards</a>. We share the belief that people analytics will continue the transformation of human resources from an administrative function to realize its potential as key business driver. Of course, I also get to hear about the challenges and frustrations facing the PA community. Many talk about the struggles with data access and quality, but more and more I am hearing about the difficulties of getting their best analytics used by the organization to improve real decisions. In some sense this is progress! We have the data and the teams, now it’s time to show leaders what we can do.</p>, <p>I believe people analytics should not and will not be ultimately judged by the transformation of HR as a function but by its ability to transform the entire firm’s strategic and operational decision-making to better measure, manage and link its people to productivity and innovation. For people analytics this means changing the way managers, leaders and employees make decisions related to other people. Therein lies people analytics’ greatest opportunity but also its greatest challenge.  It is precisely because making good decisions regarding people is so hard for humans to do that there is so much potential for organizations to do better. Yet our analytics must ultimately be placed into the hands of these same decision makers, who are free to misinterpret or ignore them.  I would argue that they are <em>primed</em> to ignore them!</p>, <p> I often talk about this perilous process as a funnel where data and analysis go in the top and altered decisions come out the bottom. But like a viscous liquid going through a funnel, the process can be slow or become easily blocked. The narrower the funnel the slower it goes. The more viscous our analytics the more they will get stuck. The better understanding you have of the size and shape of funnel facing you, the better chance you have of creating and deploying analytics that navigate the bottleneck and impacting decision-making throughout the organization.  </p>, <p><strong>The Cognitive Funnel</strong></p>, <p>As a people analyst, you can do everything right on the technical end and still not succeed. Even when you have succeeded in measuring something new and important, discovering important patterns, or even identifying an insightful causal link - you can still run smack dab into the type of decision-making barriers your analytics can help eliminate.  I think of the barriers that analytics face in being productively disseminated through the organizations as falling into three main categories – managerial attention, cognitive errors and organizational inertia. Each deserves its own post, but today I want to focus on managerial attention because it is often the first part of the funnel new analytics teams run into.</p>, <p><strong>Treating Managerial Attention as Scarce and Precious</strong></p>, <p>It's no secret that we are all awash in information. Information overload is simply the water we swim in. In companies, the long-term trend has been to increasingly push activities and responsibilities onto line managers. This has been especially true when it comes to people and HR decisions. We are expecting our managers to take on more and more of the people management responsibilities with HR overseeing process and playing a more consultative role. That is all well and good I guess, but it does mean a significant narrowing of the funnel when it comes to people decisions.</p>, <p>Analytics, especially more complex analytics, run the risk of being seen by managers as simply one more thing they must do, another dashboard they need to look at or report to be read. Because people analytics is generally new to most organizations, managers have become used to making decisions in the absence of this information, making new analysis an extra burden to compete for their already strained attention.  As humans, we have highly-developed and reflexive abilities to deal with information overload. Look at the image at the top of this post. How many black dots did you see? 3? 4? There are 12! Now you know, go back and look at the image again. As hard as you try you will never be able to see all 12 dots at once! That is your brain ignoring information you know is there and you are looking for! This same phenomenon happens at a more macro level as managers put into place systems, feedback loops and processes to help them deal with the overload of information and tasks put in front of them. </p>, <p><em>Make Attention and Time Saving Projects Your First Targets</em></p>, <p>A strategy I highly recommend to new people analytics teams is to choose projects and initiatives that clearly <em><strong>reduce</strong></em> the cognitive demand on our key managers instead of increase it. If you want to be popular, find people analytic applications that take work and attention requirements off manager’s plates. Often you don’t even need to make decisions qualitatively better, only more efficient, to achieve that first big win. One of my favorite examples comes from the early days of Google’s people analytics team when analysis showed that hiring decision quality increased with <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/10/how-google-uses-data-to-build-a-better-worker/280347/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the first four interviewers but not thereafter</a>. While it still took some time to change the company’s culture around their interviewing practices, this allowed early adopting teams within Google to save large amounts of manager and employee time without compromising on hiring quality. </p>, <p>Of course, not all people analytics initiatives worth doing fit into the category of obvious time savers, but as you prove your value in ways that alleviate the managerial attention bottleneck, you will be in a better position to introduce analytics that may demand some more attention to achieve organizational impact. While saving manager’s time and attention may seem small, these wins can have a compounding effect as they leave people with more bandwidth to make better decisions and increase performance in completely unrelated areas than the one you made more efficient. Obviously, if you can not only save time but also make the decisions better then you have an even bigger win.  </p>, <p><em>It's Not All About Prettier Pictures</em></p>, <p>A common mistake I see is that this attention problem is often framed by analysts as one that can be solved by that compelling visualization and really good storytelling. While these can definitely help garner attention and engagement with people analytics, it can often not be enough, especially in the early stages of building a track record for your team.  You are still asking your manager, HRBP or leader to add one more thing, even if it is small. </p>, <p>This is something I learned here at <a href=""http://web.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ labs</a>. People loved our attrition predictions and the science we bring to bear. I thought this was enough as we worked on ways to visualize this information in a compelling way. Carefully listening to our customers it became apparent that there remained a barrier in connecting our analytics with the day-to-day workflow of the HRBPs and managers that would ultimately act on the predictions. This led us quickly toward placing our predictions into our new action platform that simplifies workflow and emphasizes to the user how analytics help save them time and attention in doing activities for which they already responsible. Now we can clearly articulate how we can save our ultimate analytics consumers time and effort. </p>, <p>I recommend people analysts steal a page from the product development playbook and ask sharp questions about who the “user” of any given piece of analytics is and what you are demanding of them. How will the information be accessed? How will it fit into their existing workflow and decision-making process? Realize that even minor asks of extra time and attention or unnecessarily sticky transaction costs can turn valuable information into ignored information. Any careful communication plan should include a deep look at the time and attention our analytics demand of their consumer and articulate for them anytime and effort savings they may provide. As you hone your offerings with the scarcity of managerial attention in mind, you will find you get more traction and adoption within your organization.</p>, <p>What do you think? Have you experienced this part of the cognitive funnel in your work? How have you overcome it? Don’t agree? Let me know!</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p> </p>]"
The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,People Analytics’ Best of the Best Reveals a Mature and Thriving Field,Michael Housman,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-best-reveals-mature-thriving-field-michael-housman,"[<p>hiQ Labs recently announced the winners of its inaugural Elevation Awards, which recognized and honored excellence in the field of People Analytics. The awards will be presented as part of the annual Elevate Conference in Santa Clara on October 26th.</p>, <p>While the award winners themselves are notable for what they have contributed, what I think is equally as important is the fact that the awards reflect the growth and maturity of People Analytics as a space and the fact that the field has really come into its own.</p>, <p>The Guru (Lifetime Achievement) Award is being presented this year to Laszlo Bock who acknowledged that, while People Analytics is a relatively new and growing space, its fundamentals and principles are not. There are indeed those, such as Laszlo, who have already “devoted (their) career to People Analytics, and succeeded in elevating the field to a new level.” The amazing work Laszlo did at Google created a unique spotlight on the potential of People Analytics and all that it could achieve. A recognized pioneer and best-selling author, Bock said he was humbled to be recognized, noting that “the collective work of people across academia, start-ups, and larger organizations is transforming not just the HR field, but the nature and promise of work. Together we're all making work better, everywhere.”</p>, <p>That concept of making things better together and the diversity of sources, contributions and input is reflected in the variety of scope and focus of the others recognized. Companies that are relatively early in their People Analytics journeys were reflected by the <u>Rookie Award</u>, which was awarded to the people analytics team at Scottrade who, in their first year of existence, managed to automate most of the company’s ad hoc reporting to such an extent that they freed up enough time to deploy a new engagement survey, and conduct a study about what makes top branch associates successful. This is truly an inspiring example that demonstrates what can be accomplished, even relatively early in the people analytics journey.</p>, <p>The <u>Impact Award</u>, which recognized the team who made the strongest impact and a demonstrated return on investment for its company, was won by Lorenzo Canlas’ team at LinkedIn and told the story of a single analysis and intervention that paid for the entire team. It’s stories like theirs that will be the evidence the outside world looks to for confirmation that People Analytics isn’t going to lead us into the Trough of Disillusionment the <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gartner Hype Circle</a> cautions us of.  It is these stories and their resulting impact that will help carry People Analytics further and on a broader scale through the Slope of Enlightenment and into the Plateau of Productivity. </p>, <p>But what’s most inspiring is the fact that these awards show the breadth and depth of People Analytics activities across a variety of verticals, geographies, and company sizes. There’s evidence everywhere that People Analytics has matured as a space and has really come into its own. Deloitte’s Bersin Research Team has published a number of papers on People Analytics under the heading of its <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/Lexicon/details.aspx?id=15393"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Analytics Maturity Model</a>. While a survey in 2014 showed only four percent of organizations were engaging in truly ""predictive analytics,"" when Josh Bersin spoke at Elevate earlier this year, he mentioned that the number had grown to eight percent. That's a doubling in two years and I fully expect that trend to be borne out into the future. I hosted a panel earlier this year in which I asked panelists what they expected the number for predictive analytics would be five years from now and Josh suggested that he thought it would likely be 50 to 60 percent but that it would be so embedded in company culture and processes that “you wouldn’t even know it was there.”</p>, <p>There is also evidence in the growing number of companies recruiting People Analytics leaders and teams. One need only query Linkedin or check out any reputable job board to see that it’s hard to find a Fortune 500 company that hasn’t embraced People Analytics, and that it’s easy to find companies who are looking to jump on board with new hires in the field.</p>, <p>While clearly the Elevate conference is a highlight, it isn’t the only such event on the calendar. The number of conferences covering People Analytics – and sold out conferences, I might add – is staggering. Linkedin just this summer featured a post on the <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/22-conferences-people-analytics-attend-201617-david-green"" target=""_blank"">Top 23 Conferences on People Analytics to attend in 2016/2017</a>, not THE 23 conferences to attend but the TOP 23. This, to me, is staggering. </p>, <p>And if that isn’t enough to convince you that People Analytics has matured and grown into its space, just look at the courses being taught at universities and institutions across the country, including statistics programs with tracks focused on People Analytics. <a href=""http://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Coursera</a>, as an example, offers an amazing course on people analytics taught by Cade Massey, Martine Haas, and Matthew Bidwell (three amazing professors) as part of their Business Analytics concentration.</p>, <p>Not only does this reflect that that People Analytics is a discipline and that there’s sufficient demand for coursework like this, but the even cooler thing is that this is making that sort of content / knowledge available to the masses.  I fully expect that this will help drive adoption within smaller organizations that haven't yet worked their way up the adoption curve.</p>, <p>While it is true that People Analytics is still in its relative infancy and still in its ground level state, the movement and growth within the space and within the community of practice is incredible. Because it is so early, players have recognized the importance of staying in touch, in learning from each other, in sharing and developing best practices. There is also recognition in the value in sharing lessons from failures along the way, and in celebrating the successes. A look at the nomination and award categories for the Elevation Awards provides evidence of the depth and breadth of community, and of the values that have driven People Analytics to where it is today.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>]"
The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,"Values: Personal, Team and Organisation",33. Tom Marsden,http://blog.saberr.com/values-personal-team-and-organisation-307725635040#.mctgl5wfq,[]
The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,8 Top Companies Using Design Thinking in HR Analytics,34. Burke Powers,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/8-top-companies-using-design-thinking-hr-analytics-burke-powers,"[<p>One of the things I’ve been doing for years is using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Design Thinking</a> to get greater understanding and adoption when doing any analytics project. It focused the analysis and delivered actionable insights to the right person and in the right way faster than any other method. Recently, I decided to see if I could find some good examples of this approach being used at other companies and, to my delight, I found some excellent examples where, intentional or not, some fabulous companies and teams are using this to get high value results.</p>, <p>Note: I am assuming that you are familiar with Design Thinking and have at least some experience with doing an analytics project. If you would like to learn more about Design Thinking, I highly recommend checking out the <a href=""http://dschool.stanford.edu/dgift/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Stanford d.school's Virtual Crash Course in Design Thinking</a>.</p>, <p>In Design Thinking, we usually summarize the initial step of empathy as learning about the audience for whom we are designing, by observation and interview. We are usually seeking to answer two questions:</p>, <p>In analytics, this first step is to deeply understand the subject, often business processes or customer experiences, that are the subject of the analysis we are engaged in doing.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Wegman’s gives an excellent example of investing in understanding their employees when they sought to understand employee perceptions and value of benefits. They really sought to understand rather than to use an analytical technique to justify an approach they were already planning.</p>, <p>Wegman’s used an analytical technique, called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjoint_analysis"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">conjoint analysis</a>, that allowed them to understand what was most important to employees and how valuable it really was in dollar terms. This allowed them to compare options and identify opportunities that cost the company fairly little but were hugely valuable to employees. The net result was a dramatic impact for the employees as Wegman’s realized that a $1.5M investment felt like $32.5M in value for the employees.</p>, <p>This case is documented both by <a href=""http://rework.withgoogle.com/case-studies/Wegmans-conjoint-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Google’s re:Work initiative</a> and by <a href=""http://www.cebglobal.com/content/dam/cebglobal/us/EN/talent-management/workforce-surveys/pdfs/WSA-MemberStories-WegmansCaseStudy.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CEB Global</a>, who was the consulting group for the project. There is also a great video of Jack DePeters of Wegman’s and Google’s Laszlo Bock discussing Wegman’s approach to people management, if you’d like to get more details.</p>, <p>Another excellent example of a company that invested in understanding and empathizing with its employees before jumping into analysis is <a href=""http://www.issworld.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">ISS</a> of Copenhagen. ISS is one of the largest facilities services firms in the world with over 500,000 employees around the world. They take <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQWfj9CuK54"" target=""_blank"">tremendous pride in their employees</a> and take the responsibility to manage their employees and understand how the employee experience ties to the customer experience.</p>, <p>ISS studied how their employees’ engagement linked to customer experience. They worked with <a href=""http://www.proacteur.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Proacteur</a> to do the analysis to compare employee NPS and customer NPS. A big part of this project, and any project like it, is to really understand the employee experience so that you can gain an understanding of what behaviors and beliefs link the employee and customer experiences. They show a strong link between the two engagement measures and in the process they developed a good understanding of the real drivers of a great customer experience.</p>, <p>ISS told what they did and what they found in their <a href=""http://www.publications.issworld.com/ISS/External/issworld/White_papers/LinkingEmployeeandCustomerEngagement/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">write-up here</a>.</p>, <p>In Design Thinking, this step is described as creating a point of view that is based on user needs and insights. In analytics, we define the problem before we do the analysis so that we solve the right problem. In both cases, the process narrows the focus from the broad discovery of the initial step and focuses it to direct the needed innovation.</p>, <p>KPMG began a journey to understand what drove its employees and their engagement and retention. Early analysis led them to purpose-driven work as a key area to explore more deeply. This process of refining the goal and being very specific in the outcome needed helped focus all of their analytical endeavors and the metrics and reporting needed to track progress and results.</p>, <p>The resulting Higher Purpose Initiative led to significant improvements in employee engagement and morale and a stronger link between their brand and their employees’ identities.</p>, <p>Their journey has been described in a number of places, including <a href=""http://hbr.org/2015/10/how-an-accounting-firm-convinced-its-employees-they-could-change-the-world"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a Harvard Business Review article</a> and <a href=""http://rework.withgoogle.com/case-studies/KPMG-purpose/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Google’s re:Work initiative</a>.</p>, <p>Microsoft is a very data-driven organization and takes its HR analytics very seriously as well. In an article they wrote with <a href=""http://www.cipd.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CIPD</a>, they outline their approach to analytics and have a great section on defining both their inputs and outputs in their analyses.</p>, <p>In fact, they give an example of how they got to their metrics for early attrition as an example of how specific they get when defining an analysis or metric.</p>, <p>You can read a lot more detail about how they define, as well as examples from their entire analytical methodology on the <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valuing Your Talent</a> website. Their methodology is <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/media/Case%20study%20-%20Microsoft%20-%20PDF_tcm1044-5903.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">available as a case study</a>.</p>, <p>When we talk about this next phase in Design Thinking, we usually talk about brainstorming and coming up with as many creative solutions as possible for the problem we defined in the previous step. There is also an emphasis on wild ideas being encouraged. In analytics, this is usually not as wild, but there is a lot of brainstorming that should go on as you think about the different data sets, algorithms, and analytical approaches you could take to potentially solve this problem. I found many excellent examples of this being done and would like to share a few selections.</p>, <p>HP’s story of developing their Flight Risk scoring for employees has been told in many places. Most notably in Eric Seigel’s book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Predictive-Analytics-Power-Predict-Click/dp/1118356853"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Predictive Analytics: The Power To Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie Or Die</a>.</p>, <p>As any of us who have worked on turnover can attest, the first part is easy. People who are paid more, get promoted, and have higher ratings quit less. What is harder is the rest of the answers and it often varies by work group, geography, and a host of other factors. The HP team demonstrated ideation in how they approached this problem: which variables to consider, which work groups to tackle first, how to get and clean the data so that the answers they developed would be relevant, etc. I think the best part of their case is how they went about deploying it – this is a naturally valuable, but tricky project to do. It is a great read for anyone who is thinking of doing the same.</p>, <p>In addition to the detailed case study in the book, there are a few write-ups available online including the <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2013/03/14/book-hp-piloted-program-to-predict-which-workers-would-quit/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wall Street Journal</a>. The best brief description I found is on the <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/blog/predictive-analytics-human-resources/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR blog</a>.</p>, <p>I doubt any list of case studies for HR Analytics could be considered complete without acknowledging the tremendous contributions that Google has and continues to make to the thinking and direction of the field. And, indeed, Design Thinking shines through every example from Google that is published.</p>, <p>Some of the best examples described include both Project Oxygen (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/business/13hire.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">NYTimes</a> and <a href=""http://hbr.org/2013/12/how-google-sold-its-engineers-on-management"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Harvard Business Review</a> have great articles), which studied what makes a great manager, and Project Aristotle (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">NYTimes</a> article, an excellent analysis on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfGiCnhdU78"" target=""_blank"">YouTube</a>, and a foundational article by Amy Edmondson on <a href=""http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/02-062_0b5726a8-443d-4629-9e75-736679b870fc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">psychological safety</a>), which studied what makes a great team. In each of these projects, the exploration, brainstorming, and ideation is described well as the analytics team moves from definition toward prototyping and testing. The very nature of the problems we tackle on a daily basis is more complex that those tackled in most other circumstances and require a truly multi-disciplinary team to get to an answer and that is obvious here.</p>, <p>There are many other great examples of articles that give insight into Google’s People Analytics, their process and their insights. I also recommend Wharton’s article “<a href=""http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/open-sourcing-googles-hr-secrets/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Open Sourcing Google’s HR Secrets</a>” and Laszlo Bock’s “<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1475609457&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=work+rules+by+laszlo+bock"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Work Rules!</a>”</p>, <p>The basic idea of building a representation (a wireframe, a whiteboard diagram, etc.) of one or more of the ideas coming out of ideation is very much in common between Design Thinking and virtually every analytical methodology.</p>, <p>That is even more evidenced by the lack of discussion in analytics cases of building those prototypes. You don’t succeed in analytics if you can’t discover the implicit mental models of your audience and design the decision support mechanisms that are needed. This analytics process is inherently and constantly prototyping.</p>, <p>Once we have gone through the effort of truly understanding and empathizing, defining the problem, brainstorming through a range of options and then prototyping the most promising ideas, many people are used to deploying and calling it a day. The best analytics teams, however, continue to work by testing and learning or to use the Design Thinking term, engage in small-loop learning.</p>, <p>Opower is a company of about 600 employees that helps utility companies build the usage of clean energy and energy conservation among their customers. They have a small but powerful people analytics team of 1 who primarily supports their talent acquisition team. They followed a Design Thinking pattern in determining where they wanted to focus their analysis. The problem they settled on was the getting the analytics, metrics, and reporting for best managing the talent acquisition function.</p>, <p>This article, on <a href=""http://hros.co/blog/2016/2/5/opower-how-we-use-data-to-optimize-our-talent-acquisition-team"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Open Source</a>, details one of the best examples of testing and learning I have seen in an analytics case study. In their efforts to create a solution, and in dealing with a small and stretched team, Opower declared 2015 a year of Trystorming – their term for testing and iterating toward the solution needed for their customers. What they came up with is both innovative and pragmatic and a fabulous example of what can be done when combining analytics and Design Thinking.</p>, <p>Walmart has a fabulous people analytics team that is always pushing the abilities of the team and the insights generated to create more value for the business. Key to realizing that value is to test ideas and refine them as feedback is gathered. The Walmart team takes this seriously, so seriously, in fact, that they have a Test &amp; Learn team as part of their People Analytics team. Their organizational structure and capabilities have been, more or less, aligned with a Design Thinking approach and it has helped accelerate and focus their analytics. The net results have been an increased speed and greater success in virtually everything that they do.</p>, <p>Their team structure and a detailed exploration of how their Test and Learn team functions are described in <a href=""http://community.hrdaily.com.au/profiles/blogs/hr-analytics-a-look-inside-walmart-s-hr-test-learn-model"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this article</a> from HR Daily.</p>, <p>Those of us that have used Design Thinking in combination with analytics, whether it is customer or people analytics, have all experienced the clear benefits from having that customer-orientation. It helps ensure, from the very beginning, a greater probability of adoption and success with every analytics project.</p>, <p>We all need more case studies to help our leadership understand what we are trying to accomplish and to learn and build on. If you know of a case study that should be included or would like to include your own, please share it in the comments.</p>, <p>And, as always, if you are as passionate about this as I am, please reach out and connect with me on <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/burkepowers"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p> </p>]"

The year has simply flown by.</p>, <p>I’m in the fortunate position to have a unique view of the developing space of people analytics. 2016 has seen plenty of great work being done (see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-ii-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-more-people-analytics-case-studies-part-i-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), and interest levels in the subject have soared. Adoption levels are still lagging, with the rise in organisations embracing a data-driven approach to HR being steady rather than spectacular.</p>, <p>Selecting the best people analytics articles of the second half of 2016 has been a momentous task given both the quality and quantity of articles that are now being published. Even refining down to my favourite 40 has been a difficult and time-consuming process. As ever, I hope the collection proves an invaluable resource for colleagues working in the space and those interested in learning more. Enjoy and do let me know in the comments section, any articles I may have missed.</p>, <p>In no particular order…</p>, <p>One of the smartest HR leaders I’ve had the pleasure to come across, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/placidjover"" target=""_blank"">Placid Jover</a> was recently appointed to lead HR for Unilever’s £3 billion UK business. Previously, Placid had established and led Unilever’s global Organisation Performance and HR Analytics team. In this thoughtful article, Placid reflects on his experiences, how the space has evolved and what the future holds for analytics and how it will underpin HR. Placid's observations on the field are fascinating. This really is a must-read.</p>, <p>The evening before publishing, this tremendous article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a> of LinkedIn landed in my inbox causing me to make a last-minute change to the final 40. It recounts the story of how LinkedIn’s talent acquisition team couldn’t fill roles fast enough as the organisation grew by over 40% a year. Analytics were employed to build visibility and accountability into the hiring process. The results were astounding. The model that was built was able to predict within 5% actual numbers hired. Even more impressive is the fact that the intervention saved the company 15% of its recruiting budget in year one, which covered the cost of the investment in LinkedIn’s Talent Analytics team for more than 4 years. You see, this was simply too good to leave out! The Slideshare below, which was presented by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifershappley"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Shappley</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/phamchristopher"" target=""_blank"">Chris Pham</a> at Talent Connect, also covers this outstanding project. If case studies on people analytics are your thing see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-ii-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-more-people-analytics-case-studies-part-i-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The people analytics space is evolving quickly so it was definitely time for <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> to update his much-loved 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics. The result is the best version yet as not only has Patrick employed crowdsourcing techniques for what is v3.0, but he has also taken the time to highlight examples of the research he and his team have conducted at ABN AMRO. My favourite rule? That has to be a tie between #2 ‘Only do business relevant research’ and #3 ‘Create actionable insights’. Read more on the people analytics journey at ABN AMRO <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Whilst HR is “the new kid on the block” in the business when it comes to analytics this doesn't have to be an obstacle providing the function is prepared to leverage experiences from elsewhere in the organisation. In this perceptive article in the <a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">MIT Sloan Management Review</a>, the authors describe four lessons from customer analytics that can easily be applied to people analytics. This is a must-read for budding and experienced analytics practitioners alike.   </p>, <p>Bersin by Deloitte’s recent <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/business-talent-hr-predictions-2017-everything-becoming-josh-bersin"" target=""_blank"">2017 HR Predictions</a> is pretty bullish in its assertion that the next 12 months will see analytics move from a niche group in HR to an important operational business function (I certainly hope so!). This is borne out in this positive market analysis by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, Bersin’s People Analytics Research Leader. Madhura highlights three emerging trends in the space: i) the need for people analytics to add value to the business; ii) analytics as the new normal for HR; and iii) the critical role of technology. Look out for Bersin’s High-Impact People Analytics study, when it is published in 2017. </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: People Analytics maturity is growing (Source: Bersin by Deloitte, 2017 HR Predictions)</em></p>, <p>As I’ve toured the conference circuit in 2016, the issue of ethics and trust invariably crops up when the subject turns to people analytics. <a href=""http://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> believes that trust is the most important part of doing great people analytics, and I’m inclined to agree with him. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data. Not only does it affect the quality of data available, it also makes people analytics initiatives unsustainable. The Virtuous Circle of Data Quality (see Figure 2 below), conceptualised by Andrew, provides a convincing case for placing employee trust at the heart of any people analytics strategy.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: The Virtuous circle of data quality (Source: Andrew Marritt | Organization View)</em></p>, <p>In just a few short months, <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> has rapidly emerged as one of the premier resources for those working and interested in the people analytics space. Ticking both the quantity and quality boxes, there is a wealth of excellent proprietary and third party content to choose from. Choosing just one article was difficult, but I’ve plumped for this excellent piece by <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> on five reasons why HR Analytics projects fail. It’s an invaluable guide on the pitfalls to avoid for anyone working in a people analytics role, especially those just getting started – as is the recent book (<a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/ebook-basic-principles-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>The basic principles of People Analytics</em></a>) Erik and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/nandosteenhuis"" target=""_blank"">Nando Steenhuis</a> have published. I was so impressed that I happily agreed to write the foreword. </p>, <p>Failure, or more pertinently how to avoid it, is also the subject of this fabulous article by <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, one of the leading consultants and influencers in the field. The article is designed to help budding aspirants harness people analytics, and avoid project failure, by presenting a systematic, cost-effective methodology for creating robust data sets that correlate. It’s an eminently readable resource full of great advice and tips to avoid the many pitfalls that can befall even the pluckiest of novices. See Max speak at <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> in London on 25-26 April.</p>, <p>This article, which captures the main findings of the authors’ provocative <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1748-8583.12090/abstract"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">white paper</a>, asserts that the lack of progress with analytics is in part down to the lack of analytical understanding on the part of HR, whilst also apportioning blame to an industry touting expensive and complex products. The authors then offer some tips around developing an analytical mindset, focusing on the business, data governance and building the right skills and capabilities to conduct analytics. </p>, <p>Whilst acknowledging his own excitement about the role people analytics will play in transforming organisations, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation"" target=""_blank"">Andy Spence</a> correctly asserts that despite the hype adoption rates remain frustratingly low. He then describes seven challenges HR needs to overcome, as well as providing some astute advice to help practitioners succeed. Read the article alongside the accompanying Slideshare below. </p>, <p>Whilst I wrote this article, credit for the content has to go to <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> (and her co-authors <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a> and <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>), hence me being able to include it in this collection. During research for their upcoming book <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">“The Power of People: How Successful Organizations Use Workforce Analytics To Improve Business Performance”</a>, Dr. Feinzig and her co-authors found three categories of resistance that organisations need to overcome: i) stakeholder scepticism, ii) financial frugalness and iii) HR hesitancy. This article describes these three areas as well as providing recommendations as to how they can be overcome.  </p>, <p>Many organisations choose to get started with people analytics by conducting a needs analysis with their HR colleagues. In this indispensible article, <a href=""http://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> of <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a> questions this approach and instead offers his own guide for CHROs looking to get started. I particularly like Luk’s suggestion that the people analytics function should be the right-hand ‘intelligence service’ of the CHRO - data driven HR indeed.</p>, <p>Those looking to make a case for investing in people analytics in their organisations would do well to utilise the evidence presented here by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a>. The article highlights research by Sierra-Cedar demonstrating organisations with workforce analytics and data-driven decision making outperform those that don’t. The four characteristics of these “quantified” organisations are then outlined. Compelling stuff!</p>, <p>The glacial pace of progress in people analytics is perhaps not surprising since HR is trying to remake itself in an entirely new image, in an environment where supply of new analytical talent—and budget to hire them—is extremely limited. This article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a> (also a <a href=""http://twitter.com/EvanSinar"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">must-follow on Twitter</a>) and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/richwellins"" target=""_blank"">Rich Wellins</a> describes the skills and traits HR needs, how well (or not) the function is prepared (see Figure 3 below) and the relationships in the business that can best help propel HR forward. </p>, <p><em>Figure 3: What HR needs to thrive with Analytics (Source: DDI)</em></p>, <p>The field of people analytics has attracted many bright young things that otherwise probably wouldn’t have considered a career in HR. <a href=""http://de.linkedin.com/in/stefan-hierl-1488932"" target=""_blank"">Stefan Hierl</a>, who leads people analytics at Adidas is one such example. This article in the superb <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside HR</a> describes the three core pillars of Adidas’ people analytics strategy: i) align with the business to define what success looks like, ii) use data and insights to improve the employee experience, and iii) support broader strategic decision-making. </p>, <p>As <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, Head of Global Workforce Analytics at Experian, testifies in this article, many organisations are still swimming in the slow lane when it comes to workforce analytics. As he goes on to state, it doesn’t have to be a struggle, and this is even less likely to be the case if organisations and nascent analytics leaders follow the excellent advice in this article. Effective stakeholder management, building a balanced team and prioritising education and awareness are just three of the tips provided.</p>, <p>Having a CHRO who not only sponsors but is involved in the people analytics initiative is a common factor I have seen in organisations that are successful in this space. One such CHRO is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-herena-b55464a4"" target=""_blank"">Monique Herena</a> of BNY Mellon. In this article, she outlines the guiding principles she has followed to establish people analytics capability at the bank. </p>, <p>Another CHRO who has written about their organisation’s people analytics journey is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a>. This article describes how Microsoft is using analytics to help employees and teams to become more productive. More importantly, it also tackles the question of employee trust. Hogan emphasises that the purpose is to empower rather than undermine employee decision-making and articulates her vision of creating the ability for employees to own their data, improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance. Read more on Microsoft’s people analytics journey with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The second entry from the excellent <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside HR</a> comes from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/christadegnan"" target=""_blank"">Christa Degnan Manning</a> of <a href=""http://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin by Deloitte</a>. It describes four emerging trends that are increasingly shaping the field of people analytics. The main trend featured is how companies are using previously untapped sources of data (e.g. social media, biometrics, wearables) to derive insights to help tackle pressing people challenges. The other trends featured are: i) tools to support more frequent and real-time measurement; ii) integration of data from disparate sources; and iii) easier, faster analytics and visualisation of data. Speaking of which…</p>, <p>Sentiment analysis has long been used by organisations to better understand its customers and, as this piece in The Atlantic reports, is now increasingly being used by forward-thinking organisations to get invaluable insights on their employees. The article provides two excellent examples from Twitter and IBM – indeed the latter used an internally developed sentiment-analysis tool called Social Pulse to engage its employees in a revamp of its performance-review system. </p>, <p>Do algorithms completely eliminate bias and prejudice from hiring? Of course not and indeed, as described by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/gideon-mann-223a2912"" target=""_blank"">Gideon Mann</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cathy O’Neil</a> in this HBR piece, left to their own devices algorithms can even exacerbate bias - humans make them after all. The article examines this challenge and advocates the continual audit and modification of algorithms to limit inequity. As algorithms take on a larger role, HR professionals will do well to heed the advice offered here.</p>, <p>How do you engage HRBPs and make them “consumers of analytics”? This was the weighty challenge set for the first Human Capital Analytics hackathon held by Copenhagen Business School. The solutions are nicely summarised in this article by <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/saskia-menke-788b9ba0/en"" target=""_blank"">Saskia Menke</a>. It is certainly an important challenge for organisations if they are to scale analytics and create a sustainable capability across HR, so the findings make for interesting reading. </p>, <p>We read a lot about <a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/demystifying-people-analytics-part-3-the-power-of-storytelling/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">storytelling in people analytics</a>, which as <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> acknowledges in this article is one of the core requisites for success in this field. However, as Andersen goes on to argue, storytelling on its own can actually be harmful if you do not have a plausible and well-documented theory behind your data. Certainly, the example he provides in the article on leadership effectiveness by gender presents a convincing case.</p>, <p>Many organisations decide to build a Centre of Excellence (CoE) as part of its attempt to develop people analytics capability. In this piece, <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/manojkumarhranalytics"" target=""_blank"">Manoj Kumar</a>, who led HSBC’s HR Analytics CoE for five years, outlines five reasons why a CoE may not deliver ROI within expected timelines whilst also suggesting fixes to each of these challenges. I can also highly recommend Manoj’s <a href=""http://talkinghranalytics.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talking HR Analytics</a> blog as an excellent resource for those working or interested in the field. </p>, <p>A key outcome of many people analytics projects is that the insights are counterintuitive to the common wisdom of many HR (and business) leaders. This article in the McKinsey Quarterly provides three such case studies in the areas of sourcing, screening and attrition. The last example in particular resonates where the finding that employees in smaller teams, with longer periods between promotions and with lower-performing managers, were more likely to leave led to a far more tailored and focused approach.</p>, <p>Another practitioner article comes from <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/sidshishoo"" target=""_blank"">Sidhartha Shishoo</a> of Genpact on the excellent <a href=""http://www.peoplematters.in/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Matters</a> site. The article describes some of the challenges Genpact faced when embarking on its people analytics journey including i) separating analytics from reporting, ii) data quality, iii) building capability and iv) employee privacy. It’s an outstanding article and one that emphasises the need for boldness: in thinking, in strategy and in application when it comes to people analytics.</p>, <p><a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> makes a couple of points in this article that really resonate. When it comes to people analytics i) the sense of urgency is missing in too many organisations, and ii) instead of talking about it, just get started. Tom then outlines five steps to getting started.</p>, <p>Being a mathematician, prolific writer and consultant <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> tables 13 (it’s a prime!) ideas for the budding people analytics aspirant to get started. Together, these cover the whole gamut of people operations from recruiting through to engagement, performance and retention – all with the emphasis on providing business value. Plenty to inspire here.</p>, <p><a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> trains HR practitioners through his ‘Practical People Analytics’ course (and very good it is too, by all accounts). This article describes some of the lessons this experience has taught him such as the need to i) differentiate between reporting and analytics, ii) embrace rather than eschew traditional HR intuition and iii) collaborate and share. Read the article for further insights.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/beneubanks"" target=""_blank"">Ben Eubanks</a> (check out his <a href=""http://upstarthr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Upstart HR blog</a>) is one of the best of the new breed of HR analysts, so it is good to read that he believes the subject of analytics is getting serious traction amongst leaders. Similar to the article above by Sam Hill, Eubanks recognises that HR sometimes struggles to differentiate between the different types of analytics, so this definition of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive should prove a helpful resource for many.</p>, <p>Google is the poster organisation for people analytics and there have been countless articles written about their phenomenal success in this space. These two rank amongst the best. First, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/stgmaier/en"" target=""_blank"">Steffen Meier</a> describes Google’s data-driven approach and use of employee feedback to optimise its people processes and culture. He also summarises Project Oxygen (on leadership) and Project Aristotle (on team effectiveness). The New York Times article provides a fascinating and detailed description of Aristotle, which is an essential read. </p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The five key factors of team effectiveness at Google (Source: re:Work, Project Aristotle)</em></p>, <p>Google is also featured in hiQ Labs head honcho <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal"" target=""_blank"">Darren Kaplan</a>’s tribute to its former HR head <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a>, who announced he was stepping down from his role at the tech giant earlier this year. As Kaplan rightly asserts, Bock is one of the (if not ‘the’) most influential figures in people analytics and data driven HR and all of us in the space have a lot to be grateful to him for. Some of Kaplan’s colleagues at hiQ also deserve a mention and I also highly recommend reading these three articles: i) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhousman"" target=""_blank"">Michael Housman</a> reports on the recent hiQ Elevate awards as well as providing an astute analysis of the space, ii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/teuschb"" target=""_blank"">Ben Teusch</a> makes a plea for more articles at the ‘micro level’, which offer explanations of which kinds of analyses are useful for people analytics, and; iii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-a-hammond"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Hammond</a> on the opportunity and challenge of the cognitive funnel in people analytics. Quite a quartet of articles there. </p>, <p>One of the most interesting HR Tech firms I’ve come across is <a href=""http://www.saberr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Saberr</a>, who focus on making teams work well together. They’ve also employed research methods to understand how values operate at different levels of the organisation (individual, team and organisation). CEO <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/tom-marsden-b04282"" target=""_blank"">Tom Marsden</a> details the methodology and findings from the research in this engrossing article. </p>, <p><em>Figure 5: How values impact organisations (Source: Saberr)</em></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/burkepowers"" target=""_blank"">Burke Powers</a>, who leads people data, reporting and analytics at PayPal, is an advocate of design thinking to get greater understanding and adoption when tackling any analytics project. In this excellent article, Burke outlines his theory and uses eight case study examples from the likes of Google, KPMG and Microsoft as evidence of the benefits of placing design thinking at the heart of an analytics project. </p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>’s Future of Work podcast is always worth a listen and this is certainly the case when it comes to this episode featuring <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a>, CEO of <a href=""http://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a>, a social sensing and analytics platform that uses sensors in employee ID badges to drive team effectiveness and engagement. Waber offers some fascinating observations on the people analytics space, not least i) start small, but do something that makes you uncomfortable and outside of your comfort zone, ii) if you don’t start people analytics in the next two years it will be hard to catch up with those that have, and iii) on average people analytics increases top line performance by 10-15%.</p>, <p>One of the reasons tabled by HR for being unable to get started with people analytics is data quality (or the lack of it). There’s no doubt that you need to be able to justify your data when challenged, but at the same time the desire for the nirvana of 100% clean data is wholly unrealistic. This outstanding article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-kennedy-a936283"" target=""_blank"">Cameron Kennedy</a> guides the would-be analyst through some of the pitfalls and offers plenty of practical tips on collecting, cleaning and analysing data. </p>, <p>A regular entrant in my collection of the best articles on people analytics is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-roberts-b0217"" target=""_blank"">Greta Roberts</a>. In this short and sweet piece, Greta makes a simple but important observation on how HR is often misaligned to the business because it doesn’t measure the same goals. In analytics, we teach the importance of focusing on the business first and foremost, so perhaps it is in adopting people analytics that HR can find its way out of the morass Greta highlights.</p>, <p>If people analytics is to become a core part of HR’s repertoire and underpin the function of the future, the teaching of HR has to have a heavy emphasis on data, science and analytics within its curricula. It is good therefore to see articles like this by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-burris-2007751"" target=""_blank"">Ethan Burris</a> on the <a href=""http://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work blog</a>, which describes how the writer has developed a course that instructs the use of data over intuition in decision-making on people. I’m sure the likes of the CIPD and SHRM are also heading down this road.</p>, <p>In this five-part series (see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-analytics-hr-our-crystal-ball-says-scott-mondore?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-analytics-hr-our-crystal-ball-says-scott-mondore-1?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-analytics-hr-our-crystal-ball-says-scott-mondore-2?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-analytics-hr-our-crystal-ball-says-scott-mondore-3?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-analytics-hr-our-crystal-ball-says-scott-mondore-4?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-mondore-1b226b2"" target=""_blank"">Scott Mondore</a> looks into his crystal ball and provides five predictions (with added evidence) regarding analytics in HR.

The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,Learning from practice: how HR analytics avoids being a management fad,1. Dave Ulrich & Thomas Rasmussen,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090261615000443,[]
The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,The HR Analytics Journey at Shell,"Esther Bongenaar, Vasilis Giagkoulas and David Green",http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-journey-shell-david-green?trk=mp-author-card,"[<p>During the countdown to the <a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech World Congress</a> in Paris this week, I’ve been interviewing some of the great speakers I’ll be moderating on the Smart Data track at the show.</p>, <p>So far, I’ve published fascinating interviews with <em><strong>Dawn Klinghoffer</strong></em> (<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>see here</em></a>) and <em><strong>Patrick Coolen</strong></em> (<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">see here</a>) who regaled the people analytics journeys respectively at Microsoft and ABN AMRO. Crucially, given the large number of organisations still to develop capability in this area, Dawn and Patrick also offered plenty of tips on how to get started with people analytics.</p>, <p>Today, it’s the turn of <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a"" target=""_blank""><strong>Esther Bongenaar</strong></a> and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/vgiagkoulas"" target=""_blank""><strong>Vasilis Giagkoulas</strong></a> of <strong>Shell</strong>’s HR Analytics team. Like Microsoft and ABN AMRO, Shell has forged a deserved reputation as one of the leading organisations globally when it comes to people analytics. </p>, <p>In our discussion, Esther, Vasilis and I discussed the HR analytics journey at Shell and also some of the elements you need to have in place to be successful in this discipline, and, crucially, provide positive outcomes for your business. </p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: Hi David, I am the Manager of Shell’s HR Analytics team. I have been doing this for almost three years now and have enjoyed it immensely. I had other roles in Shell before, all highly analytical; now I focus on building and leading the team. The move to HR was unusual but the opportunity to make an impact pulled me to HR.</p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: Hi David, I am an HR Analytics Analyst in the HR Analytics team at Shell. I started at Shell two years ago and I got into this role as I was inspired that by applying mathematics/statistics you could solve People problems. I have an engineering background and I bring experience from my time in marketing intelligence as an analytical consultant and also from the industry as an energy leader. My role is divided in 3 parts: </p>, <p><em>Vasilis Giagkoulas and Esther Bongenaar from Shell's HR Analytics team</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: HR Analytics to me is the opportunity to make an impact to the decision-making around people using data and sophisticated methods to unlock hidden insights. As an engineer, the ability to apply mathematics to change people’s working lives for the better is powerful. HR is changing, it is moving towards a more analytical, evidence-based approach and the fact that I am part of it, fascinates me! </p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: We are indeed supporting a transition towards a better balance between intuition, beliefs, experience and then evidence. Our mission is to gain a better understanding of the drivers of employee performance and their impact on business results.  Analytics as we define it is limited to advanced and predictive analytics. But there are many others in the organization on the same mission; they support the transition with management reporting, high-quality employee surveys etc.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: Shell's HR Analytics team supports a better balance between intuition, beliefs and experience on one side and then evidence on the other</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: You need analytical skills for analytics, and then every project needs to start with a business question, preferably something that has direct and significant bottom-line impact. That assures attention, relevant results and the right level of support (for instance to acquire access to data).</p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: The discussion around the level of analytical skills and the HR understanding that an HR analytics team should possess is crucial to set the solid foundations of a successful team. However, the main thing that everyone should consider when starting with HR Analytics is to secure senior management sponsorship and commitment. To be able to bring change to the decision-making process of the organization, you need to have convincing ambassadors and leaders committed to the new way of thinking and willing to promote the work that has been done. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: Again, there are different ways to deliver evidence based content to the HR organization. In the Shell HR Analytics team we now combine skills on: </p>, <p>We work closely together with the HR Management Information (HR reporting) and Diagnostics team (operations around employee surveys and assessments), our IT business partner, and we occasionally draw on resources elsewhere in Shell for specific expertise. Before I discourage anyone, we also started small. The above reflects the HR data &amp; analytics outfit as it stands today. In the past 12 years we have been through all the stages -data cleanup, ad-hoc reporting, centralized reporting- and three years ago we started with advanced analytics in HR.  </p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: I couldn’t have said it any better!</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Shell's HR Analytics team delivers people insights to the business through the combination of six core skill areas</em></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: I don’t think there is a single recipe for success. What works for us though is strong senior management support. Sometimes when we find counterintuitive insights, we use senior support to bring the insight to the right audience rather than it ending up in a drawer. </p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: I wouldn’t differentiate in that one – I believe that the most senior support an HR Analytics team can get is from the CHRO. So I would say that to succeed it's pivotal to get the support of the CHRO.</p>, <p><u><strong>David</strong></u>: This is common amongst nearly all of the successful HR analytics teams I have encountered. Senior management sponsorship and commitment from the CHRO and other members of the Executive Leadership team is crucial to getting HR analytics initiatives off the ground, working on projects that are important to the business, enabling (sometimes difficult) decisions to be made and implemented, and communicating successes through the organisation.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: Good quality data is of course a pre-requisite for good analytics. In Shell, we have the luxury of excellent HR data. For organisations that struggle with data quality, I would advise to start with the data that is reliable (rather than dismiss all data because some of it is poor quality). We do have issues with information silos, connecting HR data with business data. It can be a real struggle but if you start with an impactful business question, then the rewards are also high and it is worth all the effort.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: Bring to the table insights that are relevant and actionable for the business. Regardless of the high complexity level of the analysis, the results need to be translated to recommended actions that will solve an actual problem.</p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: I suggest skipping all the stats in the conversations and instead talk the language of the business/stakeholder. We offer recommendations for their problems; of course this relates back to starting with the right question!  We often experience a delay between insight and change - decision makers need to get used to evidence from the data. We play an important role in building such capability throughout the HR function.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: We are just starting to uncover the information hidden in HR databases - there are so many more opportunities. And then there are exciting opportunities in new data sources; I am sure we will get to see many at the HR Tech World Congress in Paris this week! From an organization perspective, we need to mature in the integration of analytics in HR decision-making and in integrating with other analytical functions in the business. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: I am not sure I agree with the observation. It seems many companies have put analytics on the agenda, and there is so much new and exciting content and tooling presented at the HR Tech World Congress. Perhaps there are a few issues in the implementation: a lack of senior support or a shortage of analytical skills. But really, I find the progress quite energizing. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>You're speaking in the Smart Data track at the forthcoming HR Tech World Congress in Paris. What will you cover in this session and why should delegates attend?</strong></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: We are showing a case study on Cyber Security. We will walk you through an example of an analytics project: the business problem, the data sources, the insights and the outcomes for the business. And further revelations are only for the insiders and that is why you should attend J</p>, <p><u><strong>David</strong></u>: Touché Esther! You’ve certainly whetted the appetite for your session in Paris even more now. Please join Esther and Vasilis for their presentation – <strong>People Characteristics: A Predictor of Cyber-Security Incidents?</strong> – at <strong>14.55</strong> on <strong>Tuesday 25th October</strong> in the <strong>Smart Data</strong> track (<strong>Room 241</strong>). See you there!</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I am grateful to Esther and Vasilis for sharing the HR analytics journey at Shell and for providing some helpful advice to those looking to get started or accelerate their own journeys in this space. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You can follow Esther on <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a>, and Vasilis on <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/vgiagkoulas"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/BiLLGia"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You may also want to check out the following resources to learn more about the HR Analytics journey at Shell:</p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><em><strong>David</strong> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics and the future of work.

The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,Bridging the gap between insights and action,2. Anthony Walter –,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bridging-gap-between-insights-action-anthony-walter?trk=prof-post,"[<p>I continue to be optimistic about the maturity growth of the people analytics function, and there's no lack of articles that predict the continued growth of this function in 2017 and beyond. </p>, <p>Nonetheless, in all this optimism lies a common thread: The volume of analytical insights continues to grow, but this doesn’t necessarily translate to <em>meaningful</em> action. I highlight the word meaningful here, as many analytical insights sometimes do lead to action, but these actions don’t necessarily drive business results. People analytics practitioners love to talk about predictive turnover models, but what decisions are actually being made as a result of these models? What are our feedback mechanisms for ensuring we’re achieving ROI for our analytical work? <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzocanlas"" target=""_blank"">Lorenzo Canlas</a> and his team at LinkedIn have done a great job of <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/roi-talent-analytics-lorenzo-canlas?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">sharing their talent analytics journey</a> and the subsequent ROI, but bridging the gap from insights to analytics is often tough sledding (and this goes beyond just people analytics).</p>, <p>Why is it so hard to move from insights to meaningful action? In my experience, there are a multitude of reasons, some of which I will detail here (in no specific order):</p>, <p>There’s an oft-repeated saying “What gets measured, gets managed”. This is typically true, but is often to the detriment of analytics teams. In many cases, what is getting measured isn’t tightly linked to the business strategy, and so there is an unfortunate loop of measuring inconsequential activities, managing these activities, and then asking a year later: why are we measuring this again? </p>, <p>There needs to be a crystal clear linkage between the business strategy, the talent strategy, and the analytics that ultimately inform workforce needs. At Gap, we have combined the talent strategy and workforce analytics function with the understanding that all of our work is in service to executing our business strategy. For example, what capabilities are needed to grow in an increasingly digital-first retail industry? Can we build this capability internally, or do we acquire it externally? Our analytics team can analyze our internal skill sets, determine the feasibility of closing any gaps through an assessment of the effectiveness of our training programs, and formulate a build/buy strategy through our talent strategy. This ensures that our insights not only drive action, but that the action is in service to our over-arching business strategy.</p>, <p>Many companies pride themselves on having people analytics teams filled with data scientists, PhDs, and even software engineers. While this is certainly impressive and can lead to truly impactful results, I’d argue that without “soft” skills, this brainpower is often sorely under-utilized or misdirected. The soft skills can either reside in these technical employees (somewhat rare), or they can be supplemented by “translators” on your team. Critical skills that I believe are necessary to drive action, in addition to the technical expertise, are:</p>, <p>Often without these skill sets on your team, you will do some amazing analytics, but they’ll be gazed upon from afar without driving business impact.</p>, <p>This is probably one of the hardest issues to overcome in your quest to go from insight to meaningful action. Company culture can derail the best strategies and drown out game-changing insights. Cultures that are detrimental to action-oriented analytics are typically those that are:</p>, <p>In these cultures, there’s little appetite for opposing views (even if they are supported by data), and often the most frequent behaviors are enabled through historical precedence rather than data (i.e., “this is the way we’ve always done it”). This makes it very difficult to enact change or drive actions unless they support an existing viewpoint. For an analytics team, this is in direct contradiction to a nimble, growth-oriented mindset that empowers data-driven innovation and strategies. Research suggests that changing culture starts with changing behaviors first, so it’s important to find advocates in the organization that exhibit the desired behaviors and to partner with them on analytics projects. Positive results need to be communicated and recognized. While not necessary, it’s often more impactful to have this advocate in a leadership position. Outside of this, a highly networked employee can influence the desired behaviors amongst his or her colleagues quite well.</p>, <p>The last obstacle from moving from insights to meaningful action is a lack of feedback loops. Often times we provide insights, actions are agreed upon, but there isn’t any mechanism for tracking whether the actions are having an impact. There’s a couple of implications for a lack of feedback loops, including not reinforcing the behaviors for other teams, as well as not being able to quantify the ROI of the analytics team in the first place. Your analytics may be driving actions that directly contribute to business growth, but without a way to track the results, how do you know whether the results are repeatable or scalable in other parts of the organization? It could take just one analytical insight to pay for your team for years on end, but you need to isolate and track the impact of those insights first. This also reinforces a bias for action for future analytical insights, as your colleagues can point to past results and business impact as a result of your analytics. Without communicating and getting feedback on data-driven actions, you will keep providing insights to deaf ears, or even worse, your business partners will thank you for the great insights but do nothing with them.</p>, <p>In the end, these obstacles for bridging the gap from insight to meaningful action are not insurmountable. And often, you’ll only be facing one or two of these obstacles at a time. There are many ways to drive action, but at the end of the day, you can’t drag people from understanding to action. Your business partners must be willing to take your insights and apply them strategically in a way that is linked to business outcomes. A lot of time and research is dedicated to understanding the barriers of sound data collection, data management, and analysis, but there should be equally as much time spent on understanding how to encourage a bias for action as a result of analytics.

The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,Empower your employees to leverage their own data,5. Kathleen Hogan,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/empower-your-employees-leverage-own-data-kathleen-hogan?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>Having spent time last week in the realities of business analytics at the <a href=""http://www.peopleanalyticsconference.com/agenda/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wharton People Analytics Conference</a>, I’m more convinced than ever that data can transform the way we experience work.</p>, <p>Big data has become a commonplace term, and it was only a matter of time before companies figured out that in a world where everything can be measured—from your steps to the office to your keystrokes per day—evaluating a company’s most significant resource investment, its people, would reach the forefront of the discussion.</p>, <p>We’re certainly talking about this at Microsoft, and looking at some really interesting correlations that show how employees and teams can be more productive. In today’s digital workplace, it’s possible to get data about things like time spent in meetings, email volumes, response times, interactions with peer networks, and even office environments. Teams and individuals can then use those insights to identify the habits and behaviors that help them be most productive.</p>, <p>This is where you might step back and go, <em>wait a minute, hold the phone. Employees are okay with this?</em></p>, <p>The short answer is “yes.”</p>, <p>But here’s the long answer too.</p>, <p>We expect this data to empower—not undermine—employee decision making. If you give employees value by providing access to their productivity metrics, they’ll find they’re vested and energized to improve those metrics. You’re essentially offering employees insight on the most productive aspect of their days.</p>, <p>Our ultimate goal is to create the ability for employees to own their data, improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance. And I know from experience that happy, efficient employees are more collaborative, innovative, and loyal.</p>, <p><strong>Turning data into productivity</strong></p>, <p>At Microsoft, we believe building a true digital, data-driven enterprise requires organizations to empower and connect their people across everything —people, processes, data, and systems. That’s why we’ve introduced Delve Analytics in Office 365, and made it available to all of our employees. Delve Analytics gives every employee their own personal dashboard with insights into their work patterns – things like how much time they spend in meetings, writing and responding to emails, and connecting with the colleagues who have the biggest impact on their work.</p>, <p>We’re putting the power of data in the hands of our people—literally information at their fingertips to help employees understand how they spend their time and who they spend it with, so they can make meaningful improvements.</p>, <p>It’s important to point out that these dashboards are completely confidential to each individual. The employee is the only person with access to their personal dashboard, and nobody else can see it—not their manager, not HR, not IT.</p>, <p>We believe this system places us on the leading edge of a new world of work. Imagine a world where employees use their personal data to chart the career path that’s right for them and the company. A world where organizational agility, response rates to managers, and even personal network growth over time are quantifiable and people willingly share this information to help influence job interview and performance reviews. Not only <em>can</em> it happen, it’s <em>going</em> to happen.</p>, <p>I encourage you to think more about how to use the petabytes of data available to your organization to help empower employees to make their decisions about how to improve efficiency. You’ll be amazed at the results you can drive when employees have visibility and impact on their own data.</p>]"
The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,The HR Analytics Journey at Microsoft,Dawn Klinghoffer and David Green,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card,"[<p>I’m fortunate to be moderating a stellar line up of speakers in the <strong>Smart Data</strong> track at the upcoming <a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech World Congress</a> in Paris on 25th and 26th October. Leaders from Microsoft, Shell, ABN AMRO, Cisco and TIAA will be amongst those describing some of the successes their companies have enjoyed thanks to their investment in people analytics. Real life examples are invaluable to the many wishing to get started or accelerate their own efforts in this burgeoning space of HR.</p>, <p>I caught up recently with one of those speakers – <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank""><strong>Dawn Klinghoffer</strong></a>, General Manager of the HR Business Insights team at Microsoft. We discussed the capability she has built, some of the successes she has had and where the focus for people analytics will be in the future as well as previewing Dawn’s presentation in Paris. Dawn also offers plenty of tips for those looking to build their own capabilities in HR with regards to analytics.</p>, <p>Sure David, I lead the HR Business Insights team at Microsoft – a team that provides people analytics, reporting, analytical tools and technology for our HR Line and Centers of Excellence within the HR Organization. I have always been a numbers person – I majored in mathematics when I was in college, and then went on to become an Actuary. I was just not really that passionate about insurance, and found my way to Microsoft. I started in Finance, and when I returned from maternity leave after having my first child, I was asked to join HR, as the head of Comp &amp; Ben at the time thought there should be more people with analytics capability within HR. I told him that as long as I could work part-time, then it was a deal. After working part-time for 5 years, and taking over the leadership of the team – I realized it was my calling, and I have been doing this work ever since. It has been quite a journey, I had no idea I was heading towards an amazing opportunity to create a future profession.</p>, <p><em>David – Dawn, you’re not the first people analytics leader (and nor do I think you’ll be last!) to describe the profession as ‘a calling’. That’s brilliant and indicative of the passion and energy I’ve seen on show when I’ve seen you speak at conferences.</em></p>, <p>I believe that analytics in HR is the ‘how’ you differentiate yourself as a company by really understanding what is going on with your talent, and propose changes using a data driven approach. This leads to informed decisions that you can measure over time to ensure success.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I believe there are five factors to consider for starters:</p>, <p><strong>What skills/capability do you need to do analytics? How is the team structured at Microsoft?</strong> </p>, <p>It is vital in my view that you combine some type of math/data analytics/industrial organizational psychology/MBA consulting skills with an understanding of the Human Resources profession. It is important to have a well-rounded team. It’s like a puzzle, and all these skills need to work together to really create and drive powerful insights into HR. In addition, it doesn’t hurt to have someone on the team with expertise in privacy – because employee data privacy is extremely important. We need to always make sure we are using employee data in appropriate ways. </p>, <p>The HRBI organization in Microsoft is made up of 4 teams (<em>see <strong>Figure</strong> above</em>), plus an HR Data Privacy Manager: </p>, <p>These teams need to partner seamlessly in order to execute our vision of <strong>#datadrivenHR</strong>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There are a lot of answers to this question. The function should sit where it has line of sight in the overall strategy of the HR organization. I think it is extremely important to have the support of the CHRO to ensure the function is truly leveraging data when people decisions are made – in particular our programs. My experience has also been that employees (not just HR) will support this type of organization when it means that their feedback is being heard – and enables better programmatic decision-making.</p>, <p>Yes, the quality of people data is super important – but how clean really depends on the size of the organization. If you have a very large organization, and your data is 90% clean – getting it to 100% if you are looking at the data in aggregate, probably won’t make too much of a difference. But it really all depends on what you are looking at, and how granular you need to get. If you really want HR to leverage data, you need to have a data quality strategy – it has to be a priority, otherwise you will lose credibility. My advice is to set up some audits on the most important data fields you need to make decisions (and ideally aligned to the HR Strategy), and create a data governance council, made up of folks from IT, Operations and Analytics. When there is a data quality issue, you can get the right people in the room to address it.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The business problem had to do with <strong>Internal Mobility</strong> – and a perception that it was easier to find a job outside of Microsoft than it was inside. To learn more, we looked at a lot of data including historical transfer rates, engagement survey results, attrition rates and exit survey results. What we discovered was that employees who had made a recent job transfer within Microsoft were more positive about their career and more engaged than non-transfers, and employees who transferred had higher levels of engagement and better perception of career possibilities at Microsoft. In fact, we found internal transfers were more likely to stay at Microsoft than non-transfers. With that information, we took a look at our current policies around job transfers, and realized that we could help enable more transfers if we simplified our transfer process. We removed some of the restrictions (manager approval, length in role, etc), and have seen an increase in the internal mobility within the company, and a decrease in the sentiment that it is easier to find a job outside the company.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Well first you need to really understand the business problem you are trying to solve. If you have nailed that, and the data and analytics that you provide are compelling enough, then you will help drive decisions. It is important to really work in collaboration with the business, not just be an order taker, but understand the problem and the nuances. The more you are able to do that, the easier it is to drive decisions. Also, know your audience. If you know how your audience likes to visualize data, then it makes it easier to tell a story that will resonate with them. Make sure you connect with your audience, and again, make sure that the analysis you have completed answers the right business problem.</p>, <p>I think there is a lot of great momentum in this field right now. I think we are just now seeing the value that data can bring to not only decision-making, but also the drive for action. Productivity data is becoming more accessible – and if you can correlate productivity (email/calendar metadata) with engagement and performance – you can start to understand as a manager, what type of actions drive engagement on my team? How long should meetings be for optimal performance? Who are the most influential people in my network? A little over a year ago Microsoft acquired a company called VoloMetrix, which specializes in productivity metrics. We have been partnering with them on analytics (only US employees), and are starting to see some exciting insights.</p>, <p>Where I think we are going to see the biggest change is in the HR profession overall, as analytics start to reinvent the way we work. We are now starting to look for HR professionals that have the capability to understand, interpret and leverage data – and this is a trend that I believe will continue for a while. Data Analytics in general is making its way into the Universities – there are already a couple of programs that actually teach people analytics – Northeastern and the McComb Business School at the University of Texas are two examples. </p>, <p>Lastly, I think another potential trend is around data privacy – ensuring that people data is used appropriately and shared for the right business purposes. This is an area that we are really focused on at Microsoft, and I believe other companies will as well. I think the future is bright, and I am so excited to be a part of this transformation.</p>, <p>In some organizations it has been spectacular, but even steady is very positive. I think that until recently, many companies didn’t have one place to store all of their people data. People data were stored in multiple systems, and there was not an easy way to bring the data together to create a cohesive story. I think as more and more companies leverage tools such as SAP Success Factors and Workday, analyzing people data will become more accessible and usable.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I will be talking about the HR data evolution that’s changing the way we think about and view employee productivity. I will explain how Microsoft has leveraged the power of HR dashboards and the benefits of data visualization for real-time decision-making, I will discuss the emerging area of productivity metrics – and how Microsoft HR is correlating productivity with engagement and performance to influence our management strategy. Delegates should attend if they are interested in hearing about Microsoft’s journey in this space and how they could leverage these tools to help them drive value and impact within their businesses.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Thanks a lot to Dawn for telling us about her journey at Microsoft and also for sharing her expertise with those looking to progress their people analytics programs to the next level. For those going or planning to go to Paris, Dawn’s presentation – <em><strong>Data and Insights: Not Just For Analysts Anymore </strong></em>– will be at <em><strong>12:05</strong></em> on <em><strong>Tuesday 25th October</strong></em> in the <em><strong>Smart Data</strong></em> track (<em><strong>Room 241</strong></em>) – you can still buy tickets for the HR Tech World Congress <a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/tickets"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You can follow Dawn on <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You may also want to read the following articles, which provide further information on Microsoft's People Analytics journey as well as details of their acquisition of VoloMetrix:</p>, <p>Also please feel free to dip into the other People Analytics practitioner interviews in the series: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-1-anshul-sheopuri-ibm-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Anshul Sheopuri (IBM)</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-2-mark-berry-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a></p>, <p>Look out also for further interviews with leading People Analytics practitioners in the coming months.</p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><em><strong>David</strong> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics and the future of work.

The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,People Analytics: What’s in it for the employee?,6. Andrew Marritt,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-whats-employees-andrew-marritt?trk=mp-reader-card,"[<p>Early in life I developed a love for microeconomics. All of my electives at uni were micro or mathematical economics based. At the time this was unfashionable but over the last 15 years it’s risen in stature.</p>, <p>Microeconomics is all about understanding how people react to incentives. When we’re doing People Analytics we’re not dealing with numbers generated by some machine, we’re dealing with information created by people dealing with the constraints they’re facing as they try and find their best solution. To be a good analyst you always have to understand incentives.</p>, <p>It’s worth understanding that in organizations there will never be a complete alignment between the organization’s incentives and those of the individual. Assuming what is right for the business will also be right for the individual is dangerous. Therefore it’s right that we consider explicitly individual-level incentives and identify ways that these can be harnessed to increase the value to the organization.</p>, <p><strong>What’s in it for me?</strong></p>, <p>People often ask me what is the most important thing is to doing great People Analytics. The answer is simple - <strong>trust</strong>. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data.</p>, <p>Too often I see HR rushing into analysis thinking only (a) what can they do to improve the business (b) how can they improve their own lives. Whilst the first one is important, critical even, it’s always important to think about what’s in it for the employees. </p>, <p>People Analytics teams always need to be in a position where they are comfortable explaining what they’re doing to the employees. I personally think we can hold our heads high with the work we’re doing. In many instances we’re looking for information to make better, more objective decisions. We’re using data to reduce bias.</p>, <p>Give people a choice between acting in the best interest of their employer and acting in their own best interest and most of the time they’ll pick the latter. Of course sometimes the two are aligned but this isn’t always true.</p>, <p>With any decision there are likely to be winners and losers. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Prospect theory</a> suggests that those who are going to lose out will be more vocal than those who will benefit. Those whose careers have been built on politics will feel threatened by moving to an objective world.</p>, <p>However, this isn’t a reason to not being objective. Company’s can afford to be more objective. It’s right to try and maximise the overall benefit for all stakeholders.</p>, <p>For any People Analytics work to be sustainable (and thus maximising the benefit over time) it needs to benefit <em>all</em> stakeholders. You’ll need employees to help give you great quality data. To do this you have to ensure they can see why it’s in their <em>own</em> personal interest.</p>, <p>The vast proportion of our analytics projects can be explained as being good for employees. Attrition modelling is all about reducing the economic cost of people leaving. People leave because they’re unhappy. You can only reduce attrition by increasing this happiness.</p>, <p>We can think of other topics. Sickness, health &amp; safety (reducing accidents), increasing customer experience, better alignment of teams, diversity, employee experience. What is good for the employer is almost always good for the overall employee population. However the question will often need to be reframed to make this explicit.</p>, <p>People Analytics teams need to be proud of what they’re doing. They should communicate what they’re doing in as open a way as possible. They should engage with works councils where these exist.</p>, <p>If you don’t do this your work won’t be sustainable. You should assume that employees will find out what you’re doing with their data. It’s better for you to tell them in advance. It’s important to build trust.</p>, <p><strong>How thinking about employees’ incentives means better data</strong></p>, <p>Data acquisition is a fundamental part of any analysis work, and in many instances you will rely on employees providing that data. Again, if you want your work to be sustainable you need to think about what’s in it for them to support the initiative.</p>, <p>Again, we have a split between what is in the company’s interest, and what are the incentives for the employee. Unless you consider the latter, and build a convincing case for them personally benefiting, you won’t get great quality data.</p>, <p>For those who are entering the data as part of their job maybe the incentives are aligned. For many other instances there has to be a good reason why someone should provide data.</p>, <p>One of the models we use to describe how improving incentive alignment can improve analysis we call the Virtuous Circle of Data Quality. This describes how employees will contribute more information, or take better care with providing information, if they feel that the analysis provides benefits to them.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One area close to my heart is when asking for feedback. Employees are clearly motivated to provide feedback if they feel that their feedback will make a difference. We see this from both engaged employees - who care deeply about an organization and want tit to improve - and disengaged employees - who want to tell you what’s not working.</p>, <p>It’s worth thinking, however, how you can take this further by providing individual-level reporting. One early proponent of this is Towers Watson who offer <a href=""http://www.towerswatson.com/en-US/Services/Services/individual-engagement-reports"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">individual engagement reports</a>. Their implementation seems very similar to how psychometric test developers often provide reporting to test participants (an almost identical incentive problem). I think this is a great first step. I suspect that user-centred design combined with advanced analytics is the way to build upon this approach.</p>, <p><strong>Help people meet their objectives</strong></p>, <p>The explosion of workforce data has created great opportunities for helping individuals to manage their work in ways that help meet their own personal goals. As analysts and technology providers we need to now build tools that meet this need.</p>, <p>As people analytics evolved we’ve matured from solving problems which were of most interest to HR teams to addressing issues that met business objectives. The next phase will be about providing tools that enable individuals to meet their objectives, even if their objectives aren't explicitly the same as the organisations'.</p>, <p>We could think about using recommender systems to provide advice, both in terms of identifying knowledge or proposing contacts and networks. We could be thinking about how people like them manage their careers or realise more value from the vast amount of non-pay benefits that are often available, but not well known within organizations.</p>, <p>What is common across almost all of these potential solutions is that (a) there needs to be a recognition that employees’ and organizations’ incentives don’t perfectly align and (b) they use technology, data and analysis to reduce friction including search costs.</p>, <p>Analysis becomes sustainable when it addresses the needs of multiple stakeholders. HR teams should ask themselves the question of 'what's in it for the employees?' If they can answer this question effectively it greatly increases the chance of success.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</strong></p>, <p>Andrew is one of the pioneers of the European People Analytics scene.

Lorenzo Canlas –,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/roi-talent-analytics-lorenzo-canlas?trk=prof-post,"[<p>When we <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-built-talent-analytics-linkedin-lorenzo-canlas"" target=""_blank"">started Talent Analytics at LinkedIn</a>, our mission was to help our business and HR leaders make data-driven decisions for all stages of the employee lifecycle. We soon learned that we were producing a lot of data and analysis, but we had limited visibility into or influence over decisions that were being made. As a result it was difficult for us to understand the impact of our work.</p>, <p>Over time, our mission has evolved to helping our leaders use talent as a lever to achieve business objectives. We define success as having a measurable impact to business or talent metrics.</p>, <p>As we increased our focus on impact, the financial return on talent analytics increased tremendously:</p>, <p>…read <a href=""http://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/recruiting-strategy/2016/how-building-out-a-talent-analytics-function-saved-linkedin-recruiting-considerable-time-and-money"" target=""_blank"">here</a> how a single project to better forecast and plan for how many recruiters we needed, including where and when we needed them, paid for talent analytics for over four years.</p>, <p>Impact is not always measured in dollars. For example, we consider improvements in talent metrics another measure of success. For example, our diversity recruiting team, led by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/teyscott"" target=""_blank"">Tey Scott</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/kathygoss"" target=""_blank"">Kathy Goss</a>, helped Linkedin <a href=""http://blog.linkedin.com/2016/10/18/linkedin-2016-workforce-diversity-data"" target=""_blank"">increase hiring of under-represented minorities in sales by 23%</a>, which is a significant accomplishment considering sales is over 40% of our workforce.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Within the team we developed a simple framework for how we work which we call <strong>Data-driven HR</strong>. As you see the framework is not revolutionary. What has been transformational for us is shared alignment within the team and business partners about how we want to work.</p>, <p>The following are examples of projects we might do at each stage:</p>, <p>We learned a few lessons about how to most successfully drive impact. I think these lessons also apply to HR partners who are learning how work with analytics teams more effectively:</p>, <p>We still have plenty of room to improve at balancing “providing informative insights” vs. “driving impact.” The challenge is to do both well. Fortunately we have learned that a small number of successful projects can pay for the team for multiple years. And the business partners who have achieved measurable impact are starting to enjoy this new way of working.</p>, <p>Although our team has achieved a few wins, I believe we are just scratching the surface. The impact of talent analytics could be even greater. We just need to get a lot better at identifying the right outcome measures and being clear what we are trying to accomplish.</p>]"

The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,The 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics (Crowd version),10. Patrick Coolen,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-crowd-version-patrick-coolen?trk=prof-post,"[<p>“The people analytics revolution is gaining speed” according to the Bersin by Deloitte report on global human capital trends. Organizations that feel fully capable to apply HR analytics doubled from 4% to 8%. Organizations that somewhat feel capable to apply HR analytics increased from 24% to 32%. And I am happy to see that my country (the Netherlands) is in the top of the list (together with India, Italy and Australia) that value HR analytics the most as important or very important. So yes, more organizations are actually stepping up.</p>, <p>But you can also look at the same statistics and ask yourself, “What is still holding back the larger part of all organizations?” You do not have to wait until you have the ‘best’ data, the ‘best’ data scientists, the ‘best’ tools or the ‘biggest’ budget (would be nice though), but you can learn while doing. There are many things you can do to get started. You can ask help from a vendor that helps you to kick-start your analytical practice. You can ask for help from other departments in your own organization. For larger organizations there are likely people already working on advanced analytics but in a different domain like marketing. You can also partner with universities who have the analytical capability to perform analyses on your data.</p>, <p>And an easy way to get informed and inspired is simply checking out all the experts that are writing about it on social media. Please read my previous posts for more references but this time I limit myself to two. First I strongly recommend you to follow <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrgreen"" target=""_blank"">David Green</a> (IBM) on social media when you are interested in HR analytics. You will find all practitioners, bloggers, trends, articles and events related to HR analytics via his excellent posts. Secondly I urge you to read the blog of <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/company/600383?trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Acompany%2CclickedEntityId%3A600383%2Cidx%3A2-1-2%2CtarId%3A1474049239662%2Ctas%3Ainostix"" target=""_blank"">iNostix</a>, recently acquired by Deloitte, our analytical partner, on all the latest developments on HR analytics. </p>, <p><strong>About the title</strong></p>, <p>I would like to express my gratitude to many of you who took the time and effort to provide me with feedback and ideas based on the previous versions of the 10 golden rules and other posts. I used some of your thoughts and merged them into this version. So this version is not solely based on our experience anymore but also on the wisdom of the crowd. That is why I think it is only fair to call this the 10 golden rules of HR analytics (crowd version).  </p>, <p><strong>Some examples</strong></p>, <p>Then some of you asked me to provide examples of our research. This makes of course a lot of sense. Only talking about pitfalls and best practices is nice but examples really show the opportunities of HR analytics. Please accept that I can’t share the outcomes and related benefits. Nevertheless I hope the list of some of our research questions gives more flavor and guidance on the questions that can be answered by HR analytics. </p>, <p>Now, after these examples, let us dive in to the 10 golden rules of HR analytics (crowd version). Of course there are some ‘oldies’ but please keep on reading, because I added some new insights and rule 9 and 10 are new. I sincerely hope this post provides you with some food for thought and that it motivates those who haven’t started yet to take that first step. </p>, <p>HR analytics is about having a ‘smarter’ look at your data. Typically you combine HR and business datasets and apply some analytical technique to find relationship in your data that can be used to make more informed decisions. Traditional statistics like ANOVA, correlations or regression analyses do the job pretty well in most cases. But I would advise you to go beyond statistics and explore other data mining techniques like random forest decision trees (K-nearest neighbour) or clustering (K/G-means). These techniques can be, depending on your data and business question, faster, more intuitive and more actionable. In other words, do not limit yourself to the ‘classical’ set of techniques. Try others as well, experiment and learn. Check below for a nice overview of possible (not all) approaches (iNostix by Deloitte). </p>, <p>Please focus your research on what is really important to your business. What keeps them awake? What are their opportunities? How do they define success? What are the most important key performance indicators of your business? The answer of course can vary per business from customer satisfaction, safety, revenues, costs, quality, absenteeism, risk management, employee satisfaction, leadership development to diversity. To find the right question you simply have to talk to your business first and ask them lots of questions. They are perfectly capable of expressing their worries and opportunities for their business. It is up to you to find the interesting topics that relate to the workforce. Also ask your business leaders if they are willing to change their views based on the research. They have to be committed to act on the insights, even if the insights do not fit their agenda. So stay close to the opportunities and threats of your business and you have the best change to immediately prove the added value of HR analytics. </p>, <p>Creating insights means nothing if your organization will not use them. To my opinion creating insights is actually the easy part because it is a technique that can be learned or outsourced. Like repeatedly stated, the process of creating insights is about using analytics in combination with experience and intuition. You need them all to interpret the outcomes and to make the right decision. Using analytics can be much more difficult because this deals with human beings having to understand the possibilities of analytics, accepting unexpected or counter-intuitive study outcomes, having the courage and will to act on it and to be persistent in the implementation of your actions over time.</p>, <p>Strong consultancy skills, talking the language of your business, story telling, intuitive visualizations and simplicity are some key ingredients to ‘sell’ your insights to your customer. And if you are successful in doing so, you can start thinking about what actions to take. Interesting is to think about where the responsibility of your analytical department ends? Is this right after delivering the insights, after providing the right actions or after evaluating the effects of the actions? In our case, the budget and the responsibility for the actions, or interventions if you will, lie within the business. They should follow up on the actions and evaluate them periodically. Having said that we are thinking about increasing our effort in the first year after a research to provide more support on evaluations and… to remember our business on their initial commitment. </p>, <p>Related to “go beyond statistics” I encourage you to experiment more with the different modern, powerful and cool (cloud-based) tools that are available. SAS, SPSS, R et cetera are great and very useful. But as mentioned in one of my previous posts (<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-big-thing-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">The next big thing in HR analytics</a>) there are more tools available on the market that more and more are merging powerful data mining techniques, data transformation techniques, strong data visualizations with a user friendly self-service interface. Although coding can be minimized by using these types of tools you will still need an expert to use it. I am not in favor of ‘black box’ analytics. You should always be able to understand the choices behind the models and be able to export code to check or optimize your model. Nevertheless these new tools allow you to explore your data more quickly and speed up your time-to-insight. Some tools are even suitable to show to your business because of the powerful user interface. We are currently using <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/company/1742510?trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Acompany%2CclickedEntityId%3A1742510%2Cidx%3A2-1-2%2CtarId%3A1474050244430%2Ctas%3Abigml"" target=""_blank"">BigML</a> and are starting to look into <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/analytics/watson-analytics/us-en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Watson Analytics</a> (IBM). But there are more tools out there, just check out the Gartner Magic Quadrant 2016 on advanced analytical platforms. I expect Gartner to include more tools in 2017 like BigML, Dataiku, Dato, H2O, Rapid Insight, Skytree and TIBCO.</p>, <p>We do not start any project without approval from legal and compliance. Furthermore we show legal our results before going to our business. Of course anonymity of individual data is key. And in our case various types of data like health or email data are out of limit. But another very important aspect of this type of research is the goal or intention of the research. What are you going to investigate and with what purpose? The end results will be evaluated against the initial goal of the research. In our experience, legal is a true partner in our analytical journey. We are challenged and supported on issues like anonymity of data, latest (international) legislation on privacy, contracts with vendors and their compliancy with local and European regulations. Our advice is to get legal on board as soon as possible.</p>, <p>Doing analytics should not be underestimated. Analytics, although you can start small, demands discipline and it may take a while before you agree on the research question and model, before you receive the right data, before you connect the datasets and before you checked data quality and cleaned the data. These steps take approximately 75% of the whole research project. Once this is done you can relatively quickly run the models and interpret the results. A wise thing to do is not to give a final delivery date before you received all the datasets (we had one painful experience). And do plan some extra time for analyses after receiving the first results. You probably want to do some extra analyses before you finalize your results and go to the business. We recognize four steps in our approach. </p>, <p>Teaching the HR community about the principles of HR analytics is of course very important and also fun. We use workshops, summer courses and social media (internal) to preach and teach on HR analytics. Currently we are preparing our first HR analytics Lab. The idea is to invite a specific HR business line or group of experts (e.g recruitment) and to ask them what they would like to know. During the Lab session we will explore the (prepared) data with the help of BigML and experiment and explore the data together. This will suit two goals, creating immediate insights and creating more awareness and knowledge of the opportunities of HR analytics. I will let you know next time if we were successful. Then do not forget to train your analytical team. Again, we learn a lot by summits, social media, reading the latest books and articles and last year we decided to attend some lectures on data mining and algorithms. Besides this we participate in several roundtables or boards focussed on HR analytics where we share thoughts, views and best practices with peer organizations. All this keeps us up to date on the latest trends in HR analytics. Don’t forget to share your research results, besides with your customer, with relevant HR experts within recruitment, talent development, reward, learning and so on. Preach the benefits of analytics to everyone who might benefit or wants to hear it. </p>, <p>Based on my experience as a practitioner, only those organizations that manage to create and maintain a balanced blend of different relevant capabilities will be successful in HR analytics. You need to create a team that understands your business challenges, HR processes and IT (hardware and software). And last but not least your team should have impeccable analytical and consultancy skills. By the way ‘your team’ can also consist of external resources from a vendor. An overarching capability that is important to do analytics is curiosity and having an inquiring mind-set. This is true not only for your analytical department but also for the rest of HR. And you will need a few integrators or translators that are able to combine all perspectives above and create a common understanding on HR analytics within your organization. All these capabilities are captured in the HR analytics capability wheel. For more details on the HR analytics wheel please read my previous post “<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/practitioners-view-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">A practitioner’s view on HR analytics</a>” (also by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/auke-ijsselstein-8186055?authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=ZjiG&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Amynetwork%2CclickedEntityId%3A16432724%2CauthType%3ANAME_SEARCH%2Cidx%3A1-1-1%2CtarId%3A1474049922139%2Ctas%3Aauke%20ij"" target=""_blank"">Auke IJsselstein</a>). </p>, <p>Building on the previous rule. Implementing HR analytics is important but of course only a part of the puzzle if you want to create a fact-based HR organization. For me a fact-based HR organization means doing the utmost to evaluate and prove the effectiveness of your HR products and policies when it comes to supporting your business goals. Recruiters should investigate if their hires are still successfully with the company after a few years. Learning specialist should wonder if their training interventions are actually contributing to the learning goals and business performance. Reward specialists should think about the effect of reward and benefit plans on engagement, attrition and individual performance. HR business partners should continuously be working on the question “Is our workforce fit-for-purpose when it comes to achieving business success”. The answers to all these questions can lie within HR analytics but not often also by simply measuring and evaluating key performance indicators, calculating cost versus benefits (ROI), collecting new relevant data or starting a project on strategic workforce planning. This intrinsic curiosity and fact-based thinking is not the dominant culture of current HR organizations. We need a revolution in HR to move the needle towards a more data-driven way of working. </p>, <p>It is not about HR analytics but about enterprise analytics. How can advanced analytics best support your organizational goals? In some organizations it is perfectly fine to have a decentralized perspective of advanced analytics with local data, local scientists and local or cloud-based IT platforms. But for some organizations it might be extremely useful to move from a decentralized (domain-driven) perspective towards an enterprise perspective on advanced analytics. The enterprise wide view on advanced analytics, allows the organization to share and integrate data (for example from HR, finance, marketing and clients), combine analysts and build a joined corporate IT platform (‘Analytics at Work’ by Davenport, Harris and Morison). My expectation is that larger organizations will move to some form of enterprise analytics because of the economics of scale and increased opportunities to find insights because of a truly enterprise-wide data-cube.</p>, <p><strong>Contributors</strong></p>, <p>Beside all the excellent peers and experts that influenced me, I want to conclude with a list of people that took the time and effort to provide me with some great comments and constructive feedback on previous posts in the past via LinkedIn. Although I might not have used all suggestions (freedom of the author) but all your remarks made me think. The least I can do is mention you in this post as a way of saying thank you.

The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,The HR Analytics Journey at ABN AMRO,Patrick Coolen & David Green,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card,"[<p>People Analytics and data-driven HR is featured prominently on the agenda next week as the <a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>HR Tech World Congress</strong></a> lands in Paris. I’m delighted to be moderating the Smart Data track where leaders from the likes of Microsoft, Shell, ABN AMRO, Cisco and TIAA will be amongst those describing the successes their organisations have enjoyed thanks to their investments in people analytics.</p>, <p>I am interviewing some of these practitioners in the run-up to the conference – please see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>the interview with Dawn Klinghoffer of Microsoft here</em></a>. </p>, <p>I also had the pleasure of catching up recently with <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank""><strong>Patrick Coolen</strong></a>, Head of HR Metrics and Analytics at ABN AMRO, widely recognised as one of the leading global practitioners of people analytics and a regular speaker at HR Tech World.</p>, <p>In our discussion, Patrick and I discussed the people analytics journey at ABN AMRO, tips for those looking to get started on or accelerate their own journeys and what the future may hold for people analytics. Patrick, a highly regarded blogger himself, also offers some tips to any practitioners with aspirations of sharing their work with the wider community. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Sure, I am the Head of HR Metrics and Analytics at ABN AMRO. I have been doing this now for the last three years. My department is responsible for strategic workforce planning and analytics. I was always passionate about HR activities such as performance management, succession management and talent management. However, the longer I spent in HR, the more curious I became on investigating the actual impact, or return on investment if you will, of HR on our business. So what really happens when engagement increases to products sold? Or what is the actual effect of developing a specific leadership style on client satisfaction or net growth? Answering these types of questions demands a more fact-based or scientific approach. That’s why I started the HR Metrics and Analytics department within the bank.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>For me HR Analytics is the application of statistical or data mining techniques on combined datasets from HR and the business in order to support decision making in the organisation. I think it is tremendously important because it is <em><strong>the</strong></em> vehicle that allows HR and the business to get a better grip on the impact of HR policies and activities on actual business goals. Using statistics or data mining techniques (having a smarter look at your data) also reduces human bias, something we are suffering from.</p>, <p>I am tempted to direct you my article on ‘The 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics’! Seriously though, I think the three most important factors when starting in my opinion are:</p>, <p><em>David – Thanks Patrick and you are right to reference your article on ‘The 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics’. Everyone interested in People Analytics should read this article, particularly the recently updated ‘Crowdsourced Version’ – please </em><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-crowd-version-patrick-coolen?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank""><em>click here to read the article</em></a><em> or view the image below from an earlier version.</em></p>, <p><em>Figure 1: Patrick Coolen's original 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The skills mentioned above (please also reference my article <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/practitioners-view-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank""><em>‘A Practitioner’s View on HR Analytics'</em></a>) are all important. It depends on your own organisation if these skills are available in terms of quality and quantity. When we started at ABN AMRO, we did not have a data scientist in our organisation (that wanted to work in HR) so we aligned with an external partner (<a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>iNostix by Deloitte</em></a>) to perform the advanced analytics for us. Or I should say ‘with’ us. But if your organisation has a mature advanced analytics team internally this team would of course be the logical partner for you. We also partnered with another partner (<a href=""http://www.brightcompany.nl/en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Bright &amp; Company</em></a>) to create a learning program for HR on advanced analytics as well as for strategic workforce planning. This helped enable the wider culture change required to make the HR Analytics initiative sustainable within the organisation.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Patrick Coolen and </em><a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/auke-ijsselstein-8186055"" target=""_blank""><em>Auke IJsselstein</em></a><em>'s HR Analytics Capability Wheel - the premise being to achieve a balanced blend of skills - read more in </em><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/practitioners-view-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank""><em>'A Practitioner's View on HR Analytics'</em></a></p>, <p>The cliché is true - garbage in equals garbage out. But having said that, missing values or losing some records when connecting data does not always have to be a problem for analytics. Reporting is in that sense arguably much more dependent on high quality data. Reports must be accurate. For analytics it is okay to create models for a population of 10,000 using only a few thousand records. It is also true that within an analytical research project you might be able to solve some of the data problems like missing values as you go.  </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Nice try David. This is exactly what I will present at the HR Tech World Congress in Paris! We have many examples, but in Paris I will address cases in the areas of retail, private banking and one of our call centre departments. We focused on predicting actual business outcomes like net growth, client satisfaction and for instance average handling time. So I invite everyone to join my session to learn how we approached these projects and also to hear about some of the results :-)</p>, <p><em>David - Touch</em>é<em> Patrick, let's wait for the great unveiling in Paris! For now, I'll just include an image below, which highlights a few of the analytics projects you have undertaken at ABN AMRO.</em></p>, <p><em>Figure 3: An example of some of the research projects undertaken by ABN AMRO's HR Analytics team</em></p>, <p>There are two mandatory items for me here. First, always use subject matter experts from the business in your research. They know how the data is collected, what the data means, if there is any bias in the data and how to interpret the outcomes. This is vital in getting the right buy-in from the business. Secondly, do not present regression tables or technical stuff to your audience. Think of the story you want to tell and create the right visualisations to support your message. This is closely related to one of my earlier answers on the need for having good consultancy skills.</p>, <p>I believe that HR Analytics, or People Analytics if you prefer, will be a standard strategic component of HR in the future. Although a lot of organisations are lagging behind according to the recent Bersin by Deloitte report, People Analytics will not go away. But it will be one of the fundamental drivers in supporting the transformation of HR towards being more fact-based. I predict also the revival of strategic workforce planning in the near future. I also believe that there will be further investments in creating an analytical state of mind and capabilities across the rest of HR too. </p>, <p>That is a great question. I also ask myself that question. I guess we should ask those organisations that did not start yet! I think most HR activities today are not executed in a fact-based matter. It is simply not where HR is historically coming from. Statistics is something new for HR. But my advice is don’t be afraid of statistics, you can get help with that. Just concentrate on the right business question, create a capable team and you should be fine. </p>, <p>Thanks for the compliment. For us conferences like the HR Tech World Congress and blogs like yours were vital in our analytical journey. In the beginning it was more about learning best practises from other practitioners and industry influencers. Later it was more to learn about specific topics like tools and techniques being used or simply to get inspired on research topics. It is going pretty fast in the world of analytics so speaking at and attending conferences is a way for us to keep up with the latest trends and developments.</p>, <p>I enjoy writing blogs myself, and I guess I am ‘most’ proud on my series on the ‘10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics’.

The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,How do you transform HRBPs into “consumers of analytics”?,26. Saskia Menke,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-you-transform-hrbps-consumers-analytics-saskia-menke?trk=hp-feed-article-title-share,"[<p>Recently we, the Human Capital Analytics (HCA) Group at Copenhagen Business School, held our first HCA Hackathon on the topic of how to engage Human Resource Business Partners (HRPBs) into human capital analytics projects. The event was a great success and our participants were able to come up with very interesting solutions. Read more about the case and the proposed solutions below.</p>, <p><strong>What challenge were we dealing with?</strong></p>, <p>The case challenge dealt with a mid-size company that has a HRBP structure and a HR analytics team consisting of one senior analyst, two analysts and one student assistant. They cover various different topics from employer branding over leadership development to diversity and inclusion but, as a result, sometimes cannot tell the difference between the HR analytics topics.</p>, <p>Through the analysis of the <a href=""http://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-strategic-management-and-globalization/human-capital-analytics/ongoing-research/an-evaluation-of-your-companys-hca-status"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">“HCA Profile”</a> tool, we were able to identify that throughout the time we have accompanied them, they have improved greatly on their data quality and analytical competencies. However, at the same time, they lost focus in their strategic ability to act.</p>, <p>One of the problems they are currently facing is their long history of operational reporting. They are receiving a multitude of low value-added requests and now ask themselves whether they should be choosier in their services and move away from a service center to a consultative partnership. Moreover, there is a general low capability of frontline HR to digest true analytics. Finally, they want to figure out how to make HR analytics a driver of value creation in HR. Since advanced analytics still requires the “proof of value” to be recognized, they want to link analytics to the whole HR value chain analytics.</p>, <p>The participants of the HCA Hackathon were asked to analyze the case challenge and come up with solutions to the various issues addressed.</p>, <p>Among the various solutions created by the participants of the HCA Hackathon the following were stressed:</p>, <p><strong>1. Strategic Value Creation</strong></p>, <p>In order to make HR analytics a driver of value creation in HR, it is important to align HR KPIs with the overall business strategy of an organization to set a direction and ensure projects contribute to value creation. In this way, HRBPs are more likely to recognize the importance of HR analytics. It is highly recommended to quantify the changes and impacts HR analytics have on an organization to document its importance and to be able to justify the need for it. Incorporating HR analytics into annual business reviews and organizational audit reports further ensures the alignment with the overall strategy.</p>, <p><strong>2. The HR Analytics Function</strong></p>, <p>The HR analytics function has to be attentive to both its work content as well as its structure. First, the function has to deal with its operational reporting. It has to pay more attention to strategic rather than non-strategic reporting and thus prioritize projects and requests. Moving forward and doing more advanced analytics requires cutting down operational reporting. A way of doing this could, for example, be by outsourcing some of these more operational requests or by moving to self-service reporting through HRBPs and directors. Additionally, the function needs to align and standardize the format of flow of its HR insights, to facilitate the information transfer to HRBPs.</p>, <p>Second, to be able to move away from just being a service center, the HR analytics function has to be reorganized within the organization and start reporting directly to the CHRO. Moreover, to tackle the issue of low capabilities within the function, a continuous internal evaluation can help to identify the own capacities and its limits. One interesting way of extending a function’s capabilities is to engage more actively with industrial PhDs, student assistants and interns who can bring up-to-date academic knowledge into the HR analytics team by rotating them through the team.</p>, <p><strong>3. Reaching Out</strong></p>, <p>Although the answer to the question of how to transform HRBPs into ‘consumers of analytics’ lies to a great extent within the HR analytics function, its external environment should not be left unnoticed. First of all, it is of upmost importance to create more internal communication to other HR functions in order to make analytics more visible and a driver of value creation in HR. Moreover, if the goal is to engage HRBPs more extensively in HR analytics and make HR analytics a more important issue for the entire organization, good relationships and even partnerships with HRBPs and the overall business management are crucial. At the same time, the capability to digest true analytics at times extends to HRBPs. In this case, the capabilities of HRBPs must be assessed and educated if needed. They can only become ‘consumers of analytics’ if they are able to understand the topic in its thoroughness.</p>, <p><strong>A final comment</strong></p>, <p>Two final critical comments should be made with respect to the solutions listed above. First, we have been talking a lot about prioritizing projects and at the same time building partnerships and engaging HRBPs. A critical issue that should be kept in mind, however, is how to cut down on ‘low’ value requests when they are considered valuable and must-have by HRBPs without alienating them?</p>, <p>Second, while the overall aim was to transform HRBPs into the ‘consumers of analytics’, we might have to revise the role we generally tend to ascribe to HRBPs in the first place. We often tend to see them as “superheroes” that are expected to know everything and if they don’t, their skills need to be upscaled or they need to get out. However, can we really expect them to know all this? Do we even have to educate them at all? And finally, do they actually need to be those superheroes or should it be more the job of HR analytics to properly translate results?</p>, <p>These critical comments are intended to question the recommendations made above and to assess which are applicable to your own organization. After all, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to HR analytics.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>We would like to hear your own experience on this topic and look forward to reading them!</p>, <p>If you want to learn more about how to work with HRBPs and improve your HCA function contact us at hc-analytics@cbs.dk.</p>, <p>All information regarding the HCA Hackathon 2017 and other events can be found on <a href=""http://www.cbs.dk/hc-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.cbs.dk/hc-analytics</a>.</p>]"

The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,What teaching People Analytics has taught me about teaching People Analytics,29. Sam Hill,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-teaching-people-analytics-has-taught-me-part-1-sam-hill?trk=hp-feed-article-title-like,"[<p>When introducing and overviewing my ‘Practical People Analytics’ workshop, I’m inclined to say content is reflective of every lesson learnt – and every mistake made – while conducting advisory and educational engagements. And so it is.</p>, <p>Finally, having repeated that mantra for almost ten years, and to reinforce a commitment to building a community of highly skilled and analytically focused HR practitioners, this is a summary of what teaching People Analytics has taught me about teaching People Analytics.</p>, <p><strong>It is vital to differentiate between Reporting and Analytics</strong></p>, <p>People reporting is a venerable art; vital in its own right and as a foundation for people analytics – but it isn’t analytics.</p>, <p>Reporting tells us what’s happened; analysis and analytics tells us why it happened, what will happen next and what we can do to mitigate risk or maximise opportunity.</p>, <p>As educators, if we want to raise the level of debate around analytics, we must differentiate it from reporting.</p>, <p>Furthermore, whilst acknowledging that there are regular analytical journeys, rather like paths across a muddy field which can be retraced to great effect by the budding analyst; really innovative People Analytics relies on a mind-set that puts curiosity and context ahead of process.</p>, <p><strong>It is our responsibility to help delegates identify Value Add opportunities</strong></p>, <p>Essentially investigations that have the potential to generate insight, about something that is important, with a business context; insight that could inform a workforce or business decision.</p>, <p>This may relate to a current or emerging people issue, the effectiveness of a key HR process or something that helps us understand the workforce’s contribution to the execution of organisational strategy.</p>, <p>To encourage too much of anything else is to encourage trivia.</p>, <p>Frustratingly within many organisations, trivial people analysis, like a cheap buffet at a wedding reception, is still consumed – because it’s there and because it’s ‘free’. The test (one I face, of course, as a fee for service consultant) is whether anyone would actually pay hard cash for your product - we have to help practitioners create and demonstrate value.</p>, <p><strong>Don’t belittle HR intuition; embrace it</strong></p>, <p>Rather than rejecting or ignoring ‘HR intuition’ we should embrace it as a potential starting point for our investigations – essentially as a hypothesis.</p>, <p>If analysis proves a hypothesis to be true, great – we’ve got valuable insight to offer to the business – if it’s proved false, then nothing ventured nothing gained, and we may have debunked a myth.</p>, <p>HR ‘gut feel’ is not the answer, but I’m convinced it’s a valid input into a process that will ask the right question.</p>, <p><strong>Use Anecdotes to illustrate the Art of the Possible</strong></p>, <p>There is a quote from Mario Cuomo that goes something like this “we campaign in poetry, but we govern in prose”. He was referring to the world of politics, but I believe the same sentiment can be applied to People Analytics.</p>, <p>In my experience, over and above frameworks and methodologies, the anecdote or the war story that presents a genuine business based scenario – usually a thorny workforce issue – and describes how this was tackled using people analytics is the best way to engage a delegate group. This is the poetry.</p>, <p>We can then embed the learning through classroom discussion and individual or group exercises; the prose.</p>, <p><strong>We Share, We Learn</strong></p>, <p>Finally, and going off at a slight, tangent, I was delighted to be at the CIPD HR Analytics Conference in London last week; these events are a great place to hear the anecdotes, challenges, success stories and peccadillos of others.</p>, <p>One excellent point made by Maja Luckos (Capgemini) during her presentation was the importance of generously sharing knowledge across the discipline of People Analytics (“think and act open-source”).</p>, <p>This is so important; I actively encourage those who attend Workforce Dimensions courses to join conferences, events and online communities to further advance their learning. Not only that, but also to share their learning with, and celebrate the success of others.</p>, <p>In this respect (if you are not doing so already) I strongly advise you follow David Green; as well as offering excellent content of his own, he carefully curates and generously shares and promotes the content of others.

The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,Google Game Changer is changing HIS Game,Darren Kaplan,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-game-changer-changing-his-darren-grant-kaplan?published=t,"[<p>Last week, Business Insider reported that Laszlo Bock, SVP of People Operations at Google, was stepping down after 10 years. Knowing what they had in Bock, Google was reluctant to let him get away completely.  This may explain why he’s now listed as a Senior Advisor at Google. Business Insider also reported that he’ll now be acting as an advisor to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and working with other companies, something we’ve heard he’s passionate about doing.</p>, <p>Bock has been a game changer in the People Analytics space, influencing the way companies look at hiring and retaining talent.  This has been true both at Google itself and, through the conversations he’s sparked, the book he’s written, and the blogs and news coverage in which he’s shared his ideas, a much greater span of industries. This moment gives us a prime opportunity to mark 10 years of the man and his influence, and to thank him for changing the way HR uses data to make decisions. We want to wish him continued success in spreading the word.</p>, <p><strong>What he did for People Analytics</strong></p>, <p>His own Linkedin profile says it well. In leading Google’s people function –attracting, training and retaining talent – Bock says he “believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy.” Considering people spend more time working than doing anything else, he believes it is wrong that so often the work experience is “demotivating and dehumanizing.”</p>, <p>Freedom. Science. Over time, that philosophy developed into a culture of employee care, of building a workplace where people wanted to spend time, of hiring people almost guaranteed to succeed and then making sure they would never want to leave. From free gourmet food and snacks, to algorithm-based hiring and retention, to rethinking the Google interview process, Googlers are made to feel at home while at work. Bock believes his strategies for People Analytics success rest with the data. What do employees want?  Ask the data. Who are the best candidates?  Ask the data.  How can we identify who will appreciate what we offer, value what we value, and in the end, contribute to our culture and success?  Ask the data.</p>, <p>If you think these kinds of initiatives and strategies don’t make a difference, think again. During Bock’s time with the company, Google has received more than 100 awards as an employer of choice and has been named the ‘Best Company to Work For’ around the world more than 30 times. He was clearly doing something right.</p>, <p>Bock and his team have created a new space for the employer/ employee relationship to co-exist with data, and with that, new possibilities for engagement, work-life balance, and happiness in the work environment.</p>, <p>That, really, is the biggest gift Bock has given us: that cross pollination of beliefs, that sharing of ideas, passed from him to those he has worked with, to those who have read his book or picked up on his blogs. While few of us will actually work for Google, those who have drunk from the cup of People Analytics that he offers are now taking his beliefs into other fields, spreading the golden glow of possibility.  In time, they will lead others in the industry to follow suit.  </p>, <p>Bock has already inspired a new generation of leaders who believe that people decisions should be based on data, rather than solely on gut feel. Look at JP Morgan’s Global People Analytics Leader, Ian O’Keefe, Facebooks’ Director of People Insights, Scott Judd;  and Twitter's Shane McCauley all are former Googlers.</p>, <p>Or look to Evan Wittenberg, SVP of People at Box, or Arnnon Geshuri, Vice President of Human Resources at Tesla, for their strategies and successes. Previously Director of Staffing Operations at Google, Geshuri is credited with designing Google’s recruitment organization and talent acquisition strategies, among other successes.</p>, <p>All of this is to say that Bock has influenced – for the better– the way employers hire talent, and the commitment they make to keeping people happy. He has not only set Googlers up for success, he has created an ecosystem of ideas that will take that success forward to new companies. His success is backed by evidence that will support the uptake of these game changing strategies by new industries, and by others looking for better ways to work.</p>, <p>Between the ripple effect of what he has already done, and his new focus on working with more companies, I think this is just the start; the best is yet to come.

Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,30 best People Analytics articles of 2016,Figure 3,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/30-best-hr-analytics-articles-2016-david-green,"[<p>People Analytics and data driven HR continues to generate huge amounts of interest amongst those working in or associated with the field of human resources.</p>, <p>The potential analytics has to underpin the future transformation of HR with regards to digital, personalising the employee experience and identifying actionable insights that lead to better business outcomes is recognised by many but to date has only been realised by few.</p>, <p>For the last three years, I’ve collected what I believe are the best people analytics articles of the preceding 12 months. The purpose is to (hopefully) provide a useful resource for those already operating in or those who aspire to work in the field of people analytics (see collections from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-2014-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2014</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21-best-hr-analytics-articles-2015-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2015</em></a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/27-best-hr-analytics-articles-h1-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2016 Jan-Jun</em></a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2016 Jul-Dec</em></a>).</p>, <p>I have been motivated to do this ‘Best of 2016’ piece because I missed (either due to publication date or my own human error) seven articles from my previous two 2016 collections. These articles are too good not to be recognised, so without further ado and in no particular order…</p>, <p>It may seem strange to begin with an article that was published in 2015, but having somehow not included it 12 months ago, it only seems fair to start with what is one of the most important articles on people analytics I have read. The white paper provides a critique of the HR centric approach adopted by the majority of organisations when it comes to analytics and instead advocates an “outside-in” method targeted at solving real business problems. Two excellent examples from Maersk Drilling are highlighted to support the argument. Case 1 (see <em><strong>Figure 1</strong></em> below) examines the impact of leadership quality and crew competence on safety, operational performance, and customer satisfaction whilst Case 2 examines the ROI and Strategic Impact of a Technical Trainee Acceleration Program. As the article reveals, both cases show that analytics is far more effective when tackled from a business (rather than an inward looking HR) perspective and that analytics should be treated as a change management process. <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> is Vice-President of HR Data and Analytics at Shell, which is often (and rightly) cited as one of the leading practices on the planet. To find out more about what Shell is doing please see my interview <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-journey-shell-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> with <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a"" target=""_blank"">Esther Bongenaar</a> and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/vgiagkoulas"" target=""_blank"">Vasilis Giagkoulas</a>. </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: HR analytics in Maersk Drilling. Percentages shown are the squared correlations, i.e., amount of variance explained. Often HR Analytics teams will only link leadership quality and turnover (box 3), while a broad analytics approach looks at the entire value chain</em> <em> (Source: Maersk Drilling, Dave Ulrich &amp; Thomas Rasmussen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Another brilliant article – this time published just days after my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">H2 2016 collection</a> is this insightful and must-read piece by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-walter-3baa8a9"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Walter</a>, who leads Talent Strategy and Workforce Analytics at Gap. As Anthony correctly highlights, the volume of analytical insights continues to grow and whilst this is positive it is arguably a waste if these insights do not lead to <em><strong>meaningful</strong></em> actions that help <em><strong>drive</strong></em> business results. Anthony highlights four key areas of focus and suggests how these gaps between insights and action can be bridged. The four areas are: i) lack of alignment between business strategy and analytics, ii) missing skills in the analytics team (e.g. storytelling, influencing, consulting), iii) cultural impediments that block or slow down action, and; iv) the absence of feedback mechanisms to understand the impact of actions.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the smartest HR leaders I’ve had the pleasure to come across, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/placidjover"" target=""_blank"">Placid Jover</a> was recently appointed to lead HR for Unilever’s £3 billion UK business. Previously, Placid had established and led Unilever’s global Organisation Performance and HR Analytics team. In this thoughtful article, Placid reflects on his experiences, how the space has evolved and what the future holds for analytics and how it will underpin the HR of the future. Like the previous two articles, Placid emphasises the importance of focusing on insights that lead to business outcomes. A must-read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the previous article, Placid highlighted that Unilever is fortunate to have a CHRO who embraces data and lives and breathes the insight it brings to the organisation and people agendas. The role of the CHRO is pivotal, as <a href=""http://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a>, Co-Founder of <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a>, makes clear in this article for the <a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRN Blog</a>. Luk makes an impassioned plea for CHROs to work closely with their HR Analytics leader arguing that this is how HR can have a demonstrable impact on business results. The second article - an interview with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>, former HR Analytics leader and now CHRO, illustrates Luk’s point perfectly. Mark argues that when executed correctly people analytics can be the “<em>GPS of HR</em>”, as he answers with typical candour and insight a series of questions on people analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing Luk’s theme, having a CHRO who not only sponsors but is involved in driving the people analytics initiative is a common <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-constitutes-best-practice-people-analytics-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">best practice</a> I have seen in organisations that are successful in this space. One such CHRO is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a>. The first article describes how Microsoft is using analytics to help employees and teams to become more productive. More importantly, it also tackles the question of employee trust. Hogan emphasises that the purpose is to empower rather than undermine employee decision-making and articulates her vision of creating the ability for employees to own their data, improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance. Read more on Microsoft’s people analytics journey in my interview with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, who leads the HR Business Insights team <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and also an in-depth case study on the excellent <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valuing your Talent</a> site <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/research-resources/case-studies/microsoft"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>When I speak to people analytics leaders, the topic of ethics and trust is never far from the top of the list. <a href=""http://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> believes that trust is the most important part of doing great people analytics, and I’m inclined to agree with him. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data. Not only does it affect the quality of data available, it also makes people analytics initiatives unsustainable. The Virtuous Circle of Data Quality (see <em><strong>Figure 2</strong></em> below), conceptualised by Andrew, provides a convincing case for placing employee trust at the heart of any people analytics strategy.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: The Virtuous circle of data quality (Source: Andrew Marritt | Organization View)</em></p>, <p>One of the best events I attended last year was SHRM’s 18th Thought Leaders Retreat on using workforce analytics for competitive advantage. The event featured some of the leading academics and practitioners in the field and this article captures the many insights that were outlined and discussed over the two days. To pick just four examples: i) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a> highlighted that the value of analytics is in discovering how it can make a difference to the organisation, ii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> (see also Alec’s superb <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-solemnly-swear-hr-data-analytics-manifesto-alec-levenson?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">HR Analytics manifesto</a>) describing how analysing at the team level, rather than the individual level, can offer bigger returns, iii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>’s advice that sometimes it’s the quick wins that make leaders come back and ask for more, and; iv) that greater use of analytics requires HR leaders to think hard about ethical factors: what data is used, how it is used, how data is protected, and in what ways use of data and analytics might cross an ethical line. For more on using workforce analytics for competitive advantage also see <a href=""http://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/shapingthefuture/documents/eiu%20theme%203%20analytics%20report-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this white paper</a> published by SHRM two months prior to the retreat.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Intel's People Analytics methodology (Source: Alexis Fink | SHRM)</em></p>, <p>Published just a day after my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">H2 2016 collection</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra"" target=""_blank""><em>Amit Mohindra</em></a> was right to highlight that this superb article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzocanlas"" target=""_blank""><em>Lorenzo Canlas</em></a>, Head of Talent Analytics at LinkedIn, demanded inclusion. Lorenzo describes how his team has refined its mission to helping leaders use talent as a lever to achieve business objectives and how their success is defined as having a measurable impact to business or talent metrics. As Amit also commented the evolution Lorenzo describes from ""arming decision-makers"" to actively participating in the intervention/solution is game-changing. The financial return (see <em><strong>Figure 4</strong></em> below) of Lorenzo’s team demonstrates the significant impact that people analytics can have. Lorenzo goes on to cite several examples of the work his team has undertaken such as that impressively outlined in the second article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a>. This describes how a single project to better forecast and plan for how many recruiters were needed as the organisation scaled at over 40% a year, including where and when they were needed, predicted within 5% the actual numbers hired, saved the company 15% of its recruiting budget in year one and consequently paid for talent analytics for over four years. The Slideshare below, which was presented by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifershappley"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Shappley</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/phamchristopher"" target=""_blank"">Chris Pham</a> at Talent Connect, also recounts this outstanding project.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The ROI of LinkedIn's Talent Analytics team (Source: Lorenzo Canlas)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Storytelling is the last mile problem in analytics. Fail to develop a compelling story for your stakeholder and even great insights and analysis will be for nothing. In this article, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> highlights a <a href=""http://futurehrtrends.eiu.com/report-2016/executive-summary/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">study by SHRM</a> that reveals this is a skill lacking in many HR analytics efforts. He then recounts an excellent example of powerful storytelling from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>. Jonathan is co-writing a book - 'The Power of People' (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">pre-order here</a>) on people analytics, which is due to be published in May 2017 and will feature a whole chapter on storytelling from where <em><strong>Figure 5</strong></em> below is extracted. Can’t wait. Also on storytelling, the short video thereafter features <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a>, who leads Google’s fabled people analytics team. In it, Prasad distils effective communication into three key points that matter: what you want your audience to know, how you want them to feel, and what you want them to do. The basis for better storytelling in analytics starts here.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Three Principles of Storytelling (Source: The Power of People by Nigel Guenole, Sheri Feinzig &amp; Jonathan Ferrar)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The importance of storytelling also features prominently in <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a>‘s update of his much-loved 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics. The result is the best version yet as not only has Patrick used crowdsourcing for the update, but has also taken the time to highlight examples of the research he and his team have conducted at ABN AMRO. My favourite rule? That has to be a tie between #2 ‘Only do business relevant research’ and #3 ‘Create actionable insights’. Read more on the people analytics journey at ABN AMRO in my interview with Patrick <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The world’s premier analyst on all things HR gave his observations on the field of people analytics at the midpoint of 2016. The headline finding is that “<em>our research shows tremendous growth in this market, and a significant shift away from measuring HR toward a real focus on using people data to understand and predict business performance</em>”. Josh then outlines ten elements driving this growth. This is a great analysis of many of the factors I am also seeing in this space. The second article from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, Bersin’s People Analytics Research Leader, highlights three emerging trends: i) the need for people analytics to add value to the business; ii) analytics as the new normal for HR; and iii) the critical role of technology.

This excellent article (including <em><strong>Figure 7</strong></em> below) by <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen"" target=""_blank""><em>Morten Kamp Andersen</em></a>, not only outlines the six key skill areas Morten believes are required but also examines what happens when just one of those skills is missing. The second article is a wonderfully detailed white paper of a project Morten undertook with ISS to investigate whether and to what extent customer profitability is driven by customer experience and employee engagement.</p>, <p><em>Figure 7 - The six must-have competencies of a world-class people analytics team (Source: Morten Kamp Andersen)</em></p>, <p>As founder of the <a href=""http://www.talentstrategyinstitute.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Strategy Institute</a> and convenor of the <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work Conference</a>, (which, I am honoured to be co-hosting with Al on 2-3 Feb in San Francisco), <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> is one of the most popular and knowledgeable people in the field of people analytics.

Read alongside the accompanying Slideshare below.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In just a few short months, <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> has rapidly emerged as the premier blog for those working and interested in the people analytics space. Ticking both the quantity and quality boxes, there is a wealth of excellent proprietary and third party content to choose from. Choosing just one article was difficult, but I’ve plumped for this excellent piece by <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> on five reasons why HR Analytics projects fail. It’s an invaluable guide for anyone working in a people analytics role, especially those just getting started – as is the recent book (in which a version of the article also appears) (<a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/ebook-basic-principles-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>The basic principles of People Analytics</em></a>) Erik and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/nandosteenhuis"" target=""_blank"">Nando Steenhuis</a> have published. I was so impressed that I happily agreed to write the Foreword.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Failure, or more pertinently how to avoid it, is also the subject of this fabulous article by <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, one of the leading consultants and influencers in the field. The article is designed to help budding aspirants harness people analytics, and avoid project failure, by presenting a systematic, cost-effective methodology for creating robust data sets that correlate. It’s an eminently readable resource full of great advice and tips to avoid the many pitfalls that can befall even the pluckiest of novices. See Max speak at <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> in London on 25-26 April.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The glacial pace of progress in people analytics is perhaps not surprising since HR is trying to remake itself in an entirely new image, in an environment where supply of new analytical talent—and budget to hire them—is extremely limited. This article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a> (also a <a href=""http://twitter.com/EvanSinar"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">must-follow on Twitter</a>) and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/richwellins"" target=""_blank"">Rich Wellins</a> describes the skills and traits HR needs, how well (or not) the function is prepared (see <em><strong>Figure 9</strong></em> below, which had over 30,000 views when I shared it on LinkedIn before Christmas!) and the relationships in the business that can best help propel HR forward.</p>, <p><em>Figure 9: What HR needs to thrive with Analytics (Source: DDI)</em></p>, <p>One of the more impressive stories I’ve heard on building organisational capability in people analytics comes from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a> and his team at Chevron. This detailed Bersin by Deloitte Case Study* comes in two parts. Part 1 describes how Chevron tackled its challenge to scale, unify and grow analytics capabilities across the organisation, making it an essential skill for all HR professionals and ultimately turn people analytics into a competitive advantage. The key focus was the business rather than HR and steps to achieve this included i) implementing a vision and mission statement to help create an identity, ii) consistently reviewing the metrics tracked for business relevance, and iii) creating a prioritisation mechanism for all analytics projects (see <em><strong>Figure 10</strong></em> below). Building organisational capability centred on two main strategies: i) launching a Community of Practice, which now has 300 members spread across 22 business units and 18 countries, and; ii) introducing a three-stage in-house analytics curriculum that serves to create a structured learning and development program in analytics. Part 2 of the Case Study describes two additional areas of Chevron’s analytics journey: how it built a centre of excellence to optimise its organisational structure and why it believes in leveraging analytics talent across functions. This multi-pronged approach has helped create a vast and virtual people analytics team and effectively changed the way HR and the business thinks. With this firm foundation in place, Chevron is well-positioned to derive the competitive advantage it seeks from its investment in people analytics.

In the first article above from the <a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">MIT Sloan Management Review</a>, the authors describe four lessons from customer analytics than can easily be applied to people analytics. The second article looks specifically at sentiment analysis, which has long been used by organisations to better understand its customers, and is now increasingly being used by forward-thinking organisations to get invaluable insights on their employees. Two examples from Twitter and IBM are highlighted. In the latter, the article describes how IBM used an internally developed sentiment-analysis tool called Social Pulse to engage its employees in a revamp of its performance-review system.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If people analytics is to become a core component of the future HR then it is important that everyone working within the function has a reasonable level of analytical understanding and curiosity. This excellent white paper by Nigel Guenole and Sheri Feinzig, adapted from ‘The Power of People’ book (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">pre-order here</a>) they have written together with Jonathan Ferrar, simplifies the potentially complex subject of research designs and different analytical methods. Confidence (or more to the point, the lack of it) is one of the inhibitors holding many HR professional back from embracing analytics – resources like this white paper are exactly what is needed to accelerate progress. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, Head of Global Workforce Analytics at Experian, testifies in this article, many organisations are still swimming in the slow lane when it comes to workforce analytics. As he goes on to state, it doesn’t have to be a struggle, and this is less likely to be the case if organisations and nascent analytics leaders follow the excellent advice in this article. Effective stakeholder management, building a balanced team and prioritising education and awareness are just three of the tips provided.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst this white paper provides a stark analysis on the current state of people analytics it does provide HR with some helpful home truths, which if the function doesn’t address may lead to many organisations situating people analytics outside HR. The three primary areas of deficiency highlighted by the study are i) most organisations are still only doing basic analyses (see <em><strong>Figure 11</strong></em> below), ii) poor data quality, and, therefore perhaps not unsurprisingly; iii) a lack of confidence by the business in these fledgling people analytics functions. Indeed, more companies said their people analytics team hinders their analytics work than helps it. The silver lining is that these challenges can be tackled and the report goes on to elucidate some of the practical steps that organisations can take to do just that.                                         </p>, <p><em>Figure 11 - The type of people analytics projects being undertaken today (Source: New Talent Management Network)</em></p>, <p>Many organisations decide to build a Centre of Excellence (CoE) as part of its attempt to develop people analytics capability. In this piece, <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/manojkumarhranalytics"" target=""_blank"">Manoj Kumar</a>, who led HSBC’s HR Analytics CoE for five years, outlines five reasons why a CoE may not deliver ROI within expected timelines whilst also suggesting fixes to each of these challenges.

I particularly like Greta’s advice on avoiding the “Wikipedia approach” of starting with the dataset rather than the business question – a typical problem I encounter with organisations trying to get started in this space.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>How do you engage HRBPs and make them “consumers of analytics”?

It’s an outstanding article and one that emphasises the need for boldness: in thinking, in strategy and in application when it comes to people analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> trains HR practitioners through his ‘Practical People Analytics’ course (and very good it is too, by all accounts).

Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,Takeaways from People Analytics & The Future of Work 2017,1. Ben Teusch,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/takeaways-from-people-analytics-future-work-2017-pafow-ben-teusch?trk=hp-feed-article-title-like,"[<p>I had the pleasure of attending the <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work</a> (PAFOW) conference this past week. Hosts <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrgreen/"" target=""_blank"">David Green</a> put together a fantastic lineup of speakers, attendees, and solutions providers. I came away with some great conversations and valuable insights that I’ll be applying in the near future.</p>, <p>Here are some of the highlights from the speakers, grouped into some common themes that came up again and again during the conference.</p>, <p>Every presentation I heard related back to business impact in some way, but a few statements stood out to me. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> explained that analytics teams should not only solve business problems, but should also make sure they aren’t getting those business problems filtered through HR leaders. Go directly to the business leaders to make sure the business problems you’re solving are really theirs. Then, focus on those priorities.<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry/"" target=""_blank""> Mark Berry</a> recently built out an HR team, and they wanted to work on diversity, employee experience, and other HR issues. He had to convince them to save those endeavors for after they’d solved the business’ pain points. Focus, focus, focus.</p>, <p>That doesn’t mean you can’t ever bring problems to the business leaders if you’ve uncovered something they might not know about. In those situations, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/gteusch/"" target=""_blank"">Gregor Teusch</a> said he dislikes having to ask them for permission to solve the problems he’s found. “If I’m doing my job, then when I explain the problem, the executive should say, ‘Gosh, I hope you’ve fixed that by now.’” Frame the problem you’ve found as something that clashes with their values. Tell the story that will help them hope that you’ve fixed it already.</p>, <p>Optimizing the employee experience came up again and again, and most speakers were kind enough to share an example of how they've improved the employee experience where they work.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/mariacespedes/"" target=""_blank"">Maria Jimena Cespedes</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-biancani-05371b5a/"" target=""_blank"">Susan Biancani</a> shared the work they’re doing on belonging at <a href=""http://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/diversity/2017/how-linkedins-hr-chief-is-changing-the-diversity-conversation-with-belonging"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=""http://blog.airbnb.com/belong-anywhere/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Airbnb</a>, respectively. At LinkedIn, the overall belonging scores are consistently high, but some groups had lower scores, so she focused her efforts there. At Airbnb, asking, “what contributes to your sense of belonging?” revealed how to help those people without a strong sense of belonging. Both speakers shared that a sense of belonging not only has an effect on retention and engagement, but also on culture. My takeaway was that belonging matters to the business, especially when belonging is a core value for the company.</p>, <p>There were lots of other examples from company data that I thought were interesting. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> shared that at General Motors, engagement is contagious. New employees tend to see their engagement drop over time, but if they join an actively disengaged team, their engagement drops three times faster than if they join a highly engaged team. His efforts to analyze leadership development programs revealed that the best leaders are those who spend most of their time with other effective leaders. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ernestngphd/"" target=""_blank"">Ernest Ng </a>told us that Salesforce is using internal employee profiles to help employees find others with similar career objectives and goals, and even internal jobs that fit those roles.</p>, <p>Microsoft’s Business Intelligence team is making great use of the technology from their acquisition of <a href=""http://www.volometrix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Volometrix</a>, and one finding <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> shared is that employees with higher internal network growth intend to stay at Microsoft longer. At <a href=""http://www.wework.com/mission"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">WeWork</a>, whose business is to design workspaces, they’ve designed their own office to increase interactions and innovation. Gregor Teusch told us about a narrow staircase in the original office that required employees to turn slightly to get past somebody coming the other direction. That led to so many spontaneous interactions that their new office also has a small staircase -- but this time, they built small lily pads off the sides of the staircase so that those impromptu conversations can move over, and not block the staircase!</p>, <p>A really important topic for people analytics as a function is enabling HR to consume and act on data and insights. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-deneau-36b9201/"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Deneau</a>’s done a great job of this at Intuit, and her advice is to meet them where they are. HR leaders range from dataphobic, to data aware, to data savvy. The point isn’t to make every HR leader a nerd, it’s to move them one step closer. That means helping them shift from asking for data results that tell the story they want, to asking questions that data can answer. It means showing them what decisions data can help inform, and what it means to test a hypothesis. It can even be as simple as helping them articulate what problem they’re actually trying to solve. She emphasized that by focusing on good questions, interpreting the results, and telling a story, we can help HR use the work that people analytics teams do.</p>, <p>A great benefit of going to PAFOW was the many examples of how advanced analytics can be used effectively in HR. Two examples in particular stood out. First, <a href=""http://hiqlabs.squarespace.com/podcast/2016/7/11/episode-003"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ernest Ng</a> walked us through how Salesforce is using natural language processing and machine learning to triage incoming HR support tickets. What used to take several hours out of a team’s week is now almost completely automated, which helps those tickets get resolved faster. I mentioned earlier that Salesforce is using internal employee profiles to help employees find others with similar career objectives and goals, and even internal jobs that fit those roles. That effort relies heavily on natural language processing as well. I was most impressed that the analytics were being used to solve real business problems, and were definitely not some vanity project the people analytics team decided to work on.</p>, <p>The other great example was from General Motors. Michael Arena’s <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brokers-connectors-energizers-marilyn-becker"" target=""_blank"">presentation</a> on how General Motors is using Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) was really incredible. The analysis uncovers which employees are <a href=""http://hbr.org/2002/06/the-people-who-make-organizations-go-or-stop"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">brokers, connectors, or energizers</a>, and GM is using it to understand that their most innovative teams have a good mix of all three.</p>, <p>In the vein of advanced analytics, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> told us that he’s working on an update to his <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/Lexicon/details.aspx?id=15392"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Analytics Maturity Model</a> that probably won’t put predictive analysis on the same pedestal that the current model does. He’s seen that advanced analytics, and even targeted real-time reporting can also bring a lot of business impact. It was a good reminder that even with all the advances in the analytical space, the trick is still to deliver value to the business.</p>, <p>And, of course, many of the solutions providers are using really advanced techniques to solve a business problem. Each provider got a chance to briefly share their solution with the audience. Of course, I’m partial to <a href=""http://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a> -- their Keeper and Skill Mapper products use machine learning and natural language processing on public data so an organization can get in front of regrettable turnover, increase internal mobility, or help with succession planning.</p>, <p>This is a sister topic to business impact, but in my experience, making an impact doesn’t immediately lead to more budget. Michelle Deneau told us that her experience with getting a budget started with a high impact, high value project. She was asked to build a dashboard for the CEO, and it was so well received that the entire leadership team wanted something similar. Instead of just trying to do it, she explained that she wouldn’t be able to unless she got a bigger budget! My takeaway is that you have to do the high impact work, but also show that it takes a lot of work and budget to scale it throughout the organization. She also recommended patience, because it took her 18 months to pull together the budget she needed to really do it right. Michael Arena also said something I thought fit in well here: “If you want people to be interested in you, start by being interesting!” What you know, how passionate you are about analytics, doesn’t really matter if you’re trying to build your budget. You have to show how your work is impactful and interesting.</p>, <p>The last topic that came out was one I don’t see talked about enough: courage. Although HR needs to be aligned to the business, Mark Berry explained that HR leaders must lead, and specifically must advocate, educate, translate, and innovate, even though it's much easier to take orders. Gregor Teusch talked more at length about courage. He was asked how HR could have more courage, and he responded with a question: “Do you have a personal mission statement?” He draws his courage from knowing what his personal mission statement is, and having an urgency about it. He encouraged us to have a vision of what work should and can be like -- the people, the interactions they have, the meaning of the work -- and to focus our efforts there. And let that vision and focus give us the courage to act.</p>, <p>Jonathan Ferrar also shared a quote from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> about courage, kind of: “You’d have to be a brave human resources leader to say you are not taking people analytics seriously.” Maybe that’s not the kind of courage we’re looking for!</p>, <p>I wasn’t sure where to group it in, but the IBM article <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&amp;infotype=SA&amp;htmlfid=LOL14045USEN&amp;attachment=LOL14045USEN.PDF"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Starting the Workforce Analytics Journey</a> came up several times, both in Jonathan Ferrar’s presentation (he’s one of the authors) and also in several conversations I had. Lots of people analytics leaders mentioned it was a huge help to them when they were getting started.</p>, <p>I had a great experience at PAFOW. Big thanks to all the speakers, to the attendees that I had some really interesting conversations with, and of course, to Al Adamsen and David Green for pulling it all together!</p>]"

Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,It’s never too early to start,3. Amit Mohindra,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-never-too-early-start-amit-mohindra,"[<p>The growth in the number of people analytics teams, the expansion in these teams’ capabilities and the ever-increasing demand for their services has been astonishing. It is hard to believe that even five years ago people analytics professionals were rare and formal people analytics teams were even scarcer.</p>, <p>A recent meeting with an old friend in relation to a talent search prompted me to dig up a blog post I wrote after a meeting with him six years ago. At that time I was an independent consultant advising firms on people strategy, incentives and analytics. It occurred to me that some of the guidance I offered him remains valid today for organizations early in their people analytics journeys.</p>, <p>Here is the guidance, word for word, from the <a href=""http://nelsontouchconsulting.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/value-proposition-for-an-early-investment-in-human-capital-analytics-capability/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">original blog post</a>. Does it still ring true? The company my friend works for grew from strength to strength, went public, dominates its market and has steadily increased the size of its highly regarded people analytics team.</p>, <p>----</p>, <p>A few weeks ago I was visiting with an HR executive at a small but growing technology company who asked me about the value proposition for investing in a human capital analytics capability. The company uses analytics in its core business and the leadership team is inclined toward human capital analytics. In fact, it was ready to fund the development of such a capability within the company. My host was seeking an opinion on how a human capital analytics group could justify its existence so early in the company’s life. Here is what I told him, more or less.</p>, <p>The immediate returns to analytics are higher for larger companies (more data, larger dollar consequences of bad decisions, etc.) so unless there is a burning platform requiring instant attention, thoughtfulness at the outset about the size and nature of the investment is smart. Too many companies are jumping onto the human capital analytics bandwagon without adequate due diligence. “It’s the latest thing…everyone else is doing it…HR needs to be more strategic…we can be like Finance” – these are not useful considerations. Deciding to be an analytical function is a strategic move, not a tactical one.</p>, <p>With just a few thousand employees and a few years of history, there may not be a lot of data to generate compelling analytics initially, but given the expected growth trajectory, human capital analytics will become a critical management tool. Establishing a beach-head early in the game will catalyze the establishment of a human capital analytics infrastructure. Leveraging insights and support from the business analytics group will be important. There may be some healthy exchange of ideas, data, models and even people in the future.</p>, <p>Getting the systems plumbing into shape early on will pay large dividends later. Pinning down data sources and integrating them across the enterprise for ready access by analysts can frustrate analytics initiatives in larger companies. It may be prudent to use the same analytical software or systems and database architectures as the business analytics group. Advantages include price economies of scale on software licenses and lower barriers to collaboration between the human capital and business analytics groups.</p>, <p>Another aspect of establishing the infrastructure in terms of the data themselves is an emphasis on data collection – the importance of actually collecting data and ensuring their quality. The power of human capital analytics is often constrained by the lack of important individual-level human capital information such as education, certifications, previous employment history, etc. Data considerations encompass information on candidates, employees and terminations. Adjusting processes to generate relevant data and systems to accommodate the data would be important first steps.</p>, <p>Employee perspectives are an important dimension of human capital analytics. They provide a barometer of employee sentiment, engagement and alignment. Employee sensing helps to prioritize programs, capitalize on employee preferences and even predict responses to environmental or programmatic changes. A nascent human capital analytics function can begin to design appropriate employee surveys and other employee-sensing approaches. The longer the time-series data on employee perspectives, the more useful are the overall data. Too many companies don’t ask the right questions or ask the right questions in a way that proscribes the analysis. A thoughtfully designed employee survey approach yields richer and more useful information.</p>, <p>Starting a human capital analytics function early in a company’s life-cycle allows for the function to evolve according to the needs of the organization. Initially, a centralized function can build the infrastructure and set standards for data, analyses and reporting. Once the company’s divisions and geographies are large enough to need and sustain their own analytical functions, the analytics capabilities can be decentralized. The analysts are closer to the people and business and are able to provide customized immediate and local decision-making support.</p>, <p>Introducing the culture of fact-based analysis and evidence-based decision making within HR will lay the foundation for a sophisticated and savvy HR function that is attuned to the way business decisions are made. Analytic capability can be built up as a core competency within HR. It will be important, however, for HR not to succumb to extreme reliance on numbers and technical analysis. It will then be indistinguishable from Finance! Too often in the rush toward human capital analytics adoption, HR’s consummate skills in working with individuals and teams and managing all the “soft squishy stuff” (culture, motivation, performance, etc.) is overlooked and undervalued.</p>, <p>It is worthy of note that the company’s leadership looked to HR – and more specifically to the compensation and benefits function – to develop the human capital analytics capability rather than the established business analytics group (<a href=""http://nelsontouchconsulting.wordpress.com/2010/11/09/compensation-professionals-have-a-competitive-advantage-in-human-capital-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here’s why that’s a smart idea</a>). In most companies, HR might not even be considered for this leadership role since analytical capabilities, especially at the level required for serious analytical work, is seldom available in HR (<a href=""http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/story.jsp?storyId=533099008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">that’s just one of our problems</a>). However, there are some rare finds in the labor market that combine analytical abilities with HR experience.</p>, <p>Last but not least, to maintain leadership’s buy-in and support of the human capital analytics function, it will be important to help make decisions and solve problems rather than just provide reports. The initial focus should be on tackling important issues through innovative data collection, smart analysis and sober (i.e., not “Look at these fantastic β’s!!!”) presentation. Beware an initial focus on dashboards. Regular, standard reports tend to lose their gloss after the first few installments and tend to be filed away very quickly. The sure way to make the business leaders feel they have made the right decision with regard to their early analytics investment (and to ensure continued and even increased funding!) is to have deliver a sound and high-impact business result.</p>, <p><br/></p>]"
Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,Building and Scaling a People Analytics Practice with Limited Resources: 10 Guidelines for Success,4. Craig Starbuck,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-scaling-people-analytics-practice-limited-10-craig,"[<p>We can do anything with time and money, but the reality is that both are often in short supply for an emerging people analytics practice that has not yet proven its worth to the business. I routinely interact with data-driven folks in the people analytics space, both newcomers and seasoned practitioners alike, and one thing is apparent: most struggle to advance beyond descriptive analytics – if they have made the leap from reporting to analytics at all.</p>, <p>My purpose in publishing this article is to share with the community at large some guidelines to facilitate progress along the people analytics maturity curve and ensure an indelible impact that is realized by business leaders and sustained for the long-term. The material presented is neither a comprehensive set of guidelines nor a formula for success in every context, but my hope is that it will inspire and assist teams struggling to make some traction.</p>, <p>‘Pro employee’ thinking is addressed first and for good reason. I love people analytics and find great meaning and purpose in what I do. I believe this stems from a conviction that employees’ lives are in some way improved as a result of actions taken in response to the insights uncovered. Whether it is shedding light on an area of the business struggling with work-life balance or identifying developmental areas of which a group of leaders may be unaware, people analytics ideally improves employee well-being and effectively, the success of the business. It is important to embrace a ‘pro employee’ philosophy, as newfound knowledge could also have damaging repercussions if shared with the wrong people or if findings are disseminated without proper instruction on how to interpret and take action (e.g., disparate impact).</p>, <p>One way to error on the side of caution when considering whether or not to disseminate insights is to ask the following: “With this knowledge, could the recipient act in a manner that is inconsistent with our ‘pro employee’ philosophy?” If the answer to this question is not a clear “no”, discuss with your HRBPs, OD, and/or other HR leaders what was uncovered and together, determine how best to proceed. The decision may be to not share the findings with the intended audience at all or to develop a proper communication and training plan to ensure there is consistency in how recipients receive the insights and take action in response.</p>, <p>While building and scaling a people analytics function requires deep technical expertise, it also requires strong leadership. We all want to experience meaning and purpose in our work – to feel that we are working for something bigger than ourselves. Therefore, we need a clear vision of what could be to propel us forward. Coalescing the team around this vision is critical, though not necessarily easy. It requires leadership.</p>, <p>Change is hard, and expecting every member of a reporting team to be ecstatic about venturing into terrain which they likely know little about may be unrealistic. The reality is that some may not be interested in analytics and where the team is headed, but be sure to treat everyone with dignity and respect. If you are serious about advancing on your roadmap, do what you can to help the individual(s) move on to a role for which their skills and interests are better suited and then move forward. Without a team of people who are committed to the vision, there will be a degree of continual and unnecessary resistance to change, and that will only hinder progress.</p>, <p>Everyone is familiar with the old adage: garbage in, garbage out. All it takes is one instance of compromised quality to damage your reputation and cause consumers of your insights to view all findings as suspect. Be sure quality is atop your list of core values, and guard your team’s reputation at all costs. If users do not trust the insights provided, they will question what they receive which may in turn result in requests for additional reports to ‘tick-and-tie’ in order to gain confidence in the data. This is wasteful to both you and your user community.</p>, <p>To be clear, by ‘quality’ I am referring to results, which is dependent on data integrity in the source systems, proper data preparation steps, and many other factors. The majority of the data scientist’s time is spent on data preparation (data collection, cleaning and organizing, building training sets, mining for patterns, refining algorithms, etc.). If tight controls do not exist within the source application to support data integrity, data preparation efforts can only go so far in delivering reliable and valid findings. It is often the analysts who identify data integrity issues due to the nature of their work; therefore, close relationships should be formed with source application owners to put into place validation rules to proactively preclude the entry of problematic data or at the very least, exception/audit reports to identify and address the issues soon after the fact. Close relationships with application owners can also facilitate application changes that will help reduce laborious data preparation steps. For example, if the source application collects information on employees’ education via free-form text entries, it may make sense to discuss populating a selection list of schools to free analysts from having to scrub “U”, “University”, “Univ.”, etc. to produce a clean, unique list. These enhancements can save you significant amounts of time down the road.</p>, <p>While the allure may emerge to curtail important data preparation steps or make incorrect assumptions about the quality of data in the source and jump into modeling prematurely, resist the urge to take shortcuts. Ensure experienced analytics professionals are involved in the initial development of a roadmap so that decision makers who may not be as familiar with the technical minutia are better informed when creating timelines. If leaders broadcast deliverables that are not realistic, it will likely result in dangerous levels of pressure being applied to those doing the analysis which will increase the likelihood of shortcut exploitation to hit milestones. Be methodical in your approach and ensure you are progressing commensurate with a coherent and practical analytics roadmap (descriptive &gt;&gt; predictive &gt;&gt; prescriptive). If quality falls to the bottom of the priority list, all other efforts are exercises in futility and the people analytics function will face a significant risk of failure.</p>, <p>The role of automation in scaling a people analytics practice cannot be overstated. So many organizations haven’t made the leap from operational reporting to a proactive analytics focus because they are myopic in their thinking. With the technology and tools available today, I believe everyone should be continually thinking about automation. If you are performing a manual task on a recurring basis, there is a very high probability that the task can be automated; it is just a matter of whether or not it makes sense, which can be determined via a simple cost-benefit analysis. An introductory course in VBA may be all you need to build some macros and free yourself from all of those manual steps taken each week to deliver reports per your senior leaders’ specifications.</p>, <p>With respect to reducing ad-hoc report request volume, there is hope. By spending some time categorizing the report requests received over the last <em>x</em> months, and then building and automating reports and interactive dashboards to satisfy the majority of the needs, reporting responsibilities can be quickly and significantly reduced. Get serious about viewing every report request through the following prism: “What can we implement to ensure we never again receive a request for this data?” To be clear, I am not an idealist who believes that all ad-hoc report requests will eventually disappear, because that likely will never happen. However, this helps to frame a proper perspective of the report request queue so that analysts are not simply living in the moment, reacting to the deluge of data requests. Proceeding from this angle not only requires the development of an appropriate reporting solution but an effective change management process as well (e.g., canned responses that inform requestors on how the data can be obtained without the assistance of reporting resources).</p>, <p>Change is hard but if you have 30 different versions of an employee changes report, it may be time to build a single report that returns the superset of data from all 30; then, educate users on the filter and hide features in Excel to remove unwanted rows and columns. Having support up the chain is instrumental in addressing the pushback when decommissioning the superfluous versions. Rest assured, overcustomizing and maintaining many versions of the same report will only hinder progression along the people analytics maturity curve.</p>, <p>It would be an unfortunate miss to omit from this article the talent gap that needs to be addressed when transitioning from reporting to analytics. There often is not a team of experienced data scientists sitting idle and prepared to hit the ground running with a set of requirements, nor is there usually the budget to hire them. Most commonly, there exists a leadership opportunity (one that I find exciting) to augment the skillset of the existing reporting team. If the members have interest and possess initiative, the skills can usually be learned. Consider starting up a weekly “tech talk” with an environment that is safe, informal, and highly interactive to develop the requisite skills your team needs to succeed. Not only is this a cost-effective alternative to formal training, it is a great team-building exercise.</p>, <p>Change is inevitable but in our field, the rate of change is increasing exponentially. People analytics leaders are pushing the envelope daily to advance the discipline. To this end, I believe a key to success is continual learning – regardless of the current skillset of the team. I would much prefer to possess an understanding of more tools and techniques than I have time to deploy than to be approached with a high-stakes project but lack the know-how to adequately undertake it. I also believe it is important to expand horizons and continually add to our knowledge base; the moment we stop, we are behind. There are many useful statistical learning techniques (e.g., support vector machines, survival models, clustering, NLP, etc.) that are not widely employed in the social sciences but are being introduced by newcomers with computer science, statistics, and other technical backgrounds. It is important to understand the utility of each.</p>, <p>To be sure, those infographics being circulated on the characteristics of the superhero data scientist are unrealistic if the implication is that they exist within a single individual. No one person can be exceptionally proficient at all things, and we need to team with others with specialized skills to offset our shortcomings. Consider scheduling an analytics collaborative on a recurring basis, wherein resources from the organization’s various analytics pockets come together (physically or virtually) to share current and upcoming projects. I have made many connections this way and thanks to the diversity of thought, I gained exposure to new ways of looking at problems. As an added benefit, there may be synergies that can be realized due to breaking down the silos. So, make friends with the marketing analytics folks down the hall and consider the portability of their work on customer defection models to your work on employee attrition risk models.</p>, <p>People analytics teams must position themselves as strategic business partners in order to have the intended effect on the organization’s success and secure a seat at the table. When you begin having business leaders approach you to collaborate on how to obtain insights of a non-trivial nature vis-à-vis their people (rather than sending a report request so that they can work on it themselves), you have likely turned the corner and are succeeding in your plans to deliver real value to the business. This requires meeting regularly with business leaders to understand their challenges and identify viable initiatives to aid in overcoming them – a shift from a reactive to a proactive orientation. It also entails keeping abreast of industry trends and anticipating future needs to bring to these meetings relevant insights to inform future projects.</p>, <p>You may be wondering why I am suggesting an upgrade from Excel, and effectively skillsets, in an article intended to assist those with ‘limited’ resources. I have included this because in most cases Excel is inadequate when moving beyond descriptive analysis, and the software I am recommending is free. While many commercial-grade analytics toolsets are very costly, R is an open-source statistical software package that can be downloaded free of charge. It is incredibly powerful, and there is a package for just about any statistical technique you wish to utilize. It is also widely used in highly regulated environments. What I like most is the actively engaged user community, from which I am continually learning.</p>, <p>Everyone learns differently, but I will offer some resources that assisted in my understanding of statistical learning techniques and their application in R in case readers wish to follow a similar path. To be clear, the path outlined here does assume a fairly solid foundation in statistics and probability as well as computing. If you lack a foundation in stats, I recommend taking a course that covers both descriptive and inferential statistics to become comfortable with measures of spread and central tendency, variable types, measurement scales, hypothesis testing, sampling methods, probability distributions, correlation, simple/multiple linear regression, and analysis of variance. If you lack a computing background, I suggest at least an entry-level programming course to become familiar with basic computing concepts (variable declarations and assignments, arrays, loops, conditional and iterative statements, etc.). You do not need to be an expert coder to execute data analysis packages in R, but it will be helpful to understand the basics. A course in linear algebra will be helpful as well, but it is not required to learn R. With a proper command of stats and computing, there are four books that I found instrumental in building a foundation in data science techniques and deploying them within the R environment:</p>, <p>Multivariate Data Analysis was a required text for my PhD and marked my first foray into more robust social science methods such as hierarchical multiple regression, logistic regression, factorial ANOVA, principal components analysis, and structural equation modeling. This is an excellent text, of which I have a highly favorable opinion. The second text, Data Science for Business, was one I read to gain exposure to key data science concepts beyond what is conventionally employed in social science research (e.g., overfitting problems, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, cross-validation, ROC curves, etc.). This text is more conceptual than technical and easy to comprehend. With respect to the latter two texts, I found these quite helpful both in expanding my repertoire of techniques as well as applying the methods covered in the first two texts within the R environment. Though these texts are math-light, depending upon the strength of your statistical foundation most will find that they are not easy reads.</p>, <p>In addition to these texts, I learn a lot from <a href=""http://www.r-bloggers.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.r-bloggers.com</a> as well as the LinkedIn group, “The R Project for Statistical Computing”. The community is very willing to share and assist others with troubleshooting code. You might begin in more of a spectator role and as your knowledge increases, transition to an active contributor on the threads. There are many other useful online resources as well, which I hope readers will add.</p>, <p>If you learn best from education of a more formal variety, check out the panoply of options compiled by KDnuggets: <a href=""http://www.kdnuggets.com/education/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kdnuggets.com/education/index.html</a>.</p>, <p>Level one people analytics tends to utilize only the delivered fields from the HRIS (e.g., location, job profile, org tenure, etc.), but a good next step is to derive smarter variables from these fields. These can then be used to slice and dice turnover and engagement data differently, use as inputs in attrition risk models, etc. Below are some ideas to get you started:</p>, <p>At this point, it would not hurt to reread the content related to the first guideline: Think ‘Pro Employee’. While people analytics ideally improves the lives of employees and generates solid returns for the business, providing ‘interesting’ insights to managers without the proper training on how to interpret and act on them can do more harm than good. In fact, it may not be appropriate to share the finding with managers at all. If it is found that generationally isolated employees, for example, are less engaged or more likely to term than those who are not, this finding may be best used to tweak the curriculum for leadership development programs to raise awareness, with supplementary instruction on how to apply the research findings in leaders’ particular contexts. If there is any question as to how findings may be acted upon by managers, always discuss with HRBPs, OD, and/or key HR leaders before disseminating.</p>, <p>Also, remember to compute variables consistent with a need (e.g., is there reason to believe generationally isolated employees are more likely to term?). There is certainly a time and place for undertaking data mining initiatives with no a priori theories about what may be uncovered; however, more often than not, our efforts should be tied to specific hypotheses the business needs tested, which have sound theoretical underpinnings.</p>, <p>I personally prefer labels such as people analytics, workforce analytics, or talent analytics over HR analytics when describing the discipline which Bersin by Deloitte defines as “the use of measurement and analysis techniques to understand, improve, and optimize the people side of the business.” I see the distinction being more substantive than semantical. HR analytics seems to suggest a practice that seeks answers to HR’s questions and perceived challenges (which may or may not be aligned with what the business cares about) rather than proactively undertaking projects that support key people challenges limiting the success of the business. As well, HR analytics tends to leverage only HR data sources rather than integrating data from the myriad of often underutilized sources available within an organization. People analytics, on the other hand, ideally leverages many data sources, HR and non-HR, which house potentially valuable data points throughout the lifecycle of each employee. People analytics seeks to support non-trivial challenges the business needs to overcome by converting ambiguous problem statements into clearly defined research questions and testable hypotheses. Per these definitions, HR analytics is positioned as a relatively elementary stage on the people analytics continuum.</p>, <p>The failure to test HR’s deep-seated assumptions is precisely why employee engagement has received so much controversy over years past. It has long been accepted as fact that engagement has a positive impact on a company’s bottom line but very little has been done to substantiate this claim. Testing this theory, of course, requires data beyond what is usually housed in HR systems. Engagement aside, people analytics initiatives often position ‘success’ or ‘performance’ as an outcome variable (e.g., identifying why top performers leave, predicting on-the-job performance pre-hire, etc.), but what makes an employee a top performer is a loaded question. While people analytics utilize the HRIS, onboarding survey data, engagement results, exit survey data, and other data that often lives in HR, it should also leverage sources that can provide a more comprehensive and valid measure of ‘success’ (e.g., customer leads by employee, success of customers served by employee, sales by employee, etc.). The additional predictors also aid in separating the signal from the noise (e.g., economic factors explaining variance in sales, customer retention issues, etc.). While valuable insights can be captured from performance appraisals, I believe this type of subjective data is best married with hard numbers such as sales figures when modeling employee success for customer-facing roles. For other roles, performance is of course more difficult to quantify and the way in which success is defined is highly situational. In any case, more data sources can only increase the robustness of the measure and provide more broadly accepted conceptions.</p>, <p>The effective utilization of many data sources requires collaboration with other pockets of analytics across the organization as well as working closely with SMEs to understand the data and leverage it appropriately. With the utilization of additional data sources comes significant risk if one believes he/she can fully understand the intricacies of data from all systems. So, be sure to make some friends across departmental lines and ask for help before attempting to incorporate data about which you are relatively unfamiliar.</p>, <p>In addition, I encourage thinking about everything as another potential data source – apart from the conventional data sources such as CRM, ERP, etc. The world is awash with data and like it or not, data is collected on just about everything we do today. So, consider what is relevant and appropriate (always error on the side of caution when unsure and think ‘pro-employee’), and be creative. Sure, the data generated from the source may be unstructured and require munging; however, the value it may provide may very well warrant the effort of converting those free-form comments into dummy-coded quantitative variables for use in models. Also, that analytics collaborative may very well lead to knowledge of data sources you never knew existed.</p>, <p>One word of warning with respect to strategies for collecting additional data: caution should be exercised when incenting people for it. It is plausible that many won't feel comfortable providing an honest assessment of what is being requested (e.g., perceptions of one's direct superior) but since they really want the free month of casual days, there exists a risk that they will open a survey, provide straight line or socially desirable responses, and invalidate the results. At least in the case of survey research, I am not an advocate of incenting participation to achieve a higher response rate unless the data requested is unequivocally non-sensitive in nature.</p>, <p>Last, but certainly not least, is the need to facilitate and demonstrate the impact of people analytics. Implicit in demonstrating a return is that there is a measurable impact to be shown; therefore, it is important to first highlight the importance of facilitating actionable results.</p>, <p>If we believe a project will not result in findings that are actionable, why should we conduct the project in the first place? That is obvious, yet the extent to which the findings are actionable is not always easily ascertained up front because of the uncertainty around what will be found. However, the following questions may prove helpful when designing the project: “If this hypothesis is supported, what actions can be taken? If it is not supported, what actions can be taken? If we measure <em>X</em> on our next pulse survey, what can we do if the score is unfavorable?” If the answer to these questions is, “nothing, but it would be interesting to test/measure”, focus on something that is more likely to benefit the business.</p>, <p>One way to facilitate greater impact is ensuring decision makers fully understand the findings being presented so that there is clear direction on how to proceed. If there is ambiguity around what was found due to using technical nomenclature that is confusing for the target audience, the potential for impact is limited. Replace “variable <em>X</em> explained significant variance in variable <em>Y</em>” with “<em>X</em> drives <em>Y</em>” or “<em>X</em> influences <em>Y</em>”. Effective storytelling with data is key, yet often difficult for highly technical folks. Also, it may be tempting to employ the most flexible and sophisticated techniques in your toolbox but if the results produced by them are difficult to explain to a non-technical audience, you may want to entertain an alternative if the project does not warrant exceptional robustness and precision (e.g., for classification, most will find decision trees more intuitive than the log odds from a logistic regression model). Furthermore, the importance of effective visualizations in data storytelling cannot be overstated. While you may be comfortable with numbers, there is a significant risk that the meaning you wish to convey will be lost in translation without visuals. Always know your audience and tailor the presentation accordingly.</p>, <p>With respect to demonstrating the ROI, I know of very few organizations that are doing this. We should not assume that our efforts are delivering what we presumed they would at the outset; we should validate the outcomes empirically. If turnover was an issue and action plans were rolled out as a result of attrition risk models, follow up to see if the treatment had an effect on turnover by comparing rates at time 1 and time 2. If it is leadership training outcomes that are of interest, track changes to scores on relevant engagement drivers (if surveys are administered frequently) to gauge the size of the effect and whether it is sustained over time.</p>, <p>The ability to quantify the impact of our efforts can go a long way when justifying the need to grow a people analytics function or when programs are on the chopping block and their impact can be substantiated. As well, insight into the efficacy of actions will inform future action plans when analytics reveal similar issues that warrant attention. Be sure not to do something purely because other organizations are doing it or because it is currently the ‘popular’ thing to do in people analytics circles. Take on initiatives because they have the potential to generate insights that are important to the business; after all, supporting the success of the business is why the people analytics function exists, and we should never lose sight of that.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>Please join the conversation: </strong>I look forward to the dialogue around the material covered here. What are some of the most unconventional data sources you have leveraged for people analytics projects, and did the resulting insights prove significant? What are some ways in which you have demonstrated the ROI of your initiatives, and what was the response? What are some additional guidelines that may position a people analytics function for success?</p>]"
Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,The Three Types of People Analytics Projects,5. Lorenzo Canlas,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-types-talent-analytics-projects-lorenzo-canlas,"[<p>In my previous post I shared how our team’s focus on impact has helped us increase the <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/roi-talent-analytics-lorenzo-canlas"" target=""_blank"">ROI on talent analytics</a> from zero in 2014 to over 10X projected for 2017. An important step for our team has been learning to more clearly define the desired outcome at the beginning of a project before we start any work. Over time, we have learned that project outcomes fall into one of three categories: inform, insight, or actions &amp; accountability. Our success as a team has been determined by our ability to recognize the difference between these types of outcomes and balance our business partners’ needs for each type of work.</p>, <p><strong>Conditions of satisfaction</strong></p>, <p>When we first started the team we diligently recorded our Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) for the quarter. At the end of each quarter we would rush to complete each OKR. But besides completing the work (e.g., provide a pretty presentation with lots of cuts of data), the majority of time the work ended there and no specific decisions or actions were implemented.</p>, <p>We wanted the team to be more intentional about what defined success for a project besides ""the client was happy."" So we borrowed the concept of “<a href=""http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/clarifying-the-relationship-between-definition-of-done-and-conditions-of-sa"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Conditions of Satisfaction</a>” (COS) from our experiences with the data warehouse team using the Agile development process. In Agile, the COS differentiates “did we write the code?” from “did the code provide the intended functionality for the user?”</p>, <p>We realized that up to this point we had completed lots of work, but had no idea if we accomplished the Conditions of Satisfaction because we never defined them in the first place. So we started asking what success means at the beginning of each project.</p>, <p><strong>COS fall into three buckets</strong></p>, <p>At first every project we did had COS that was “complete the work.” But with time and experience we learned that success generally falls into three buckets:</p>, <p>Below are some examples of each type of project:</p>, <p><strong>The wisdom to know the difference….</strong></p>, <p>All three types of projects are valuable, but the real game changer comes from educating our clients on what type of work we do and improving alignment on what we are trying to accomplish. For example:</p>, <p><strong>Signal to noise</strong></p>, <p>Business leaders deserve to be informed about basic talent metrics, but there are times when anecdotes or rumors create noise in the organization. Simple charts and dashboards provide the facts in these situations. However sometimes we go overboard on custom analysis when a few simple metrics would do, which only reduces the signal to noise ratio.</p>, <p><strong>Actionable insights</strong></p>, <p>The best insights have obvious next steps, such as: “the large volume of internal transfers in Q4 are causing X millions of dollars in lost sales…” The obvious next step would be to reduce the rate of internal transfers in Q4.</p>, <p>With other insights the next step is less clear: “we predict that these 100 people are at high risk of leaving next year…” Predicting attrition is interesting but what do we do with it? Is there anything we can do to reduce the risk those 100 people leaving? Are they in business critical roles? Without additional information then predicting who will leave next year is merely informative.</p>, <p>It has taken some team for our team to learn to recognize between analysis that is actionable or merely informative. Once the team learned the difference, we started asking at the beginning of a project: “<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-question-you-should-ask-before-taking-new-research-andrew-kritzer"" target=""_blank"">what would we do if you knew the answer to this question</a>?” Determining up front if the answer is going to inform or drive actions helps us better scope and prioritize work that is most likely to be implemented.</p>, <p><strong>Fish or cut bait</strong></p>, <p>When we complete an analysis we need to make a decision on what to do next. Did we identify clear next steps or do we need to do more analysis? What specific actions will move the needed and how will we implement them?</p>, <p>In our early days we completed lots of projects then started new fishing expeditions without ever tracking if any decisions or actions were implemented.</p>, <p>Now we try to make an informed decision when to “fish or cut bait.” i.e., when to get involved in the messy business of cross functional alignment on what actions are needed and how we will measure success, or when to adjust our priorities if we did not identify anything actionable or there is limited appetite for implementation.</p>, <p><strong>Beyond mountains there are mountains...</strong></p>, <p>To meet the needs of our business partners, all three types of projects (inform, insights, and actions &amp; accountability) have their place. In our first year as a team, almost all of our work was informative. In 2016 we pushed very hard to provide more actionable insights and drive impact. Our goal for this year is to do great work in all three areas while helping individual analysts learn to better align with their respective partners on what we are trying to accomplish.</p>]"

Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,Why informal networks are set to revolutionise HR and People Analytics,9. Greg Newman,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-informal-networks-set-revolutionize-hr-people-analytics-newman,"[<p>To date, very little work has been done on harnessing the power of informal networks and teams in the world of both global HR and global HR systems. The fluidity and informality of teamwork has always meant that capturing ever changing team membership and dynamics has been virtually impossible at any scale.</p>, <p>While the science behind Organisational Network Analytics (ONA) pioneered by the likes of <a href=""http://www.drkaren.us/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Karen Stephenson</a> and <a href=""http://www.robcross.org/network_ona.htm"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> is well established, tried and tested, the ability to scale these insights has always been a major hurdle to these powerful data points going mainstream.</p>, <p>There is no doubt that traditional survey based ONA produces great results, but its ‘point in time’ nature and high cost overheads means that while the teams and connections can be identified and measured, keeping the data up to date is virtually impossible.</p>, <p><strong>Informal networks are finally visible</strong></p>, <p><em>Figure 1: Revealing the relationships that underpin the formal hierachy.</em></p>, <p>Recent technological leaps by companies like my own (trustsphere.com) which have moved ONA from a paper based process into a real time continuous flow of data have transformed the ability of organization’s to map their informal networks and understand the way that work really gets done.</p>, <p>And as HR and newly formed People Analytics/Workforce Analytics teams try to tackle the seemingly Sisyphean challenges of trying to measure engagement, productivity and employee happiness, as a straight forward alternative, ONA is well placed to supply hard data and answer specific business questions.</p>, <p>I predict that 2017 will be the year that ONA goes mainstream and finally gets the recognition that it deserves, as it demonstrates how it can quickly shine a light on these types of business critical questions:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>Who are our most influential employees?</strong></p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Finding the hidden influencers that hold the network together.</em></p>, <p>By measuring the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Betweenness Centrality</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector_centrality"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Eigenvector Centrality</a> (and some other secret sauce), ONA can quickly quantify the ability of an employee to exert their influence (and even who within the organization they can actually influence in their informal network).This enables organisations to find the hidden influencers in their organisation who can help drive change and support business transformation.</p>, <p><strong>Who do we actually need to be succession planning for?</strong></p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Who has the most unique and useful networks?</em></p>, <p>Succession planning has always been a fairly formulaic and cursory process, with target roles identified by looking simply at an employee’s place in the formal hierarchy. By looking at every employee’s network, its uniqueness, isolation and amount of overlap, ONA helps organisations find those employees who are key to managing critical internal and external networks and where succession planning effort should actually be directed. The next step is to understand which employee would be the best fit, who has already built a similar network or show the network potential of a possible successor.</p>, <p><strong>How immersed are my employees in our organization?</strong></p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Mapping an employees changing network immersion.</em></p>, <p>From tracking the speed and spread of a new starters network to identifying hidden <a href=""http://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/are-you-a-zombie-employee-over-half-of-singapore-companies-have-them"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">zombies</a>, <a href=""http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/3-employees-who-secretly-kill-productivity.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">vampires</a> and identifying potential flight risk, ONA can be used to provide real time insights on the growth, plateau, stagnation and shrinkage of employees internal and external networks, a key signal in overall engagement and performance.</p>, <p><strong>What does good leadership behavior look like?</strong></p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Quantified evidence of leaderships behaviours.</em></p>, <p>Measuring the number of strong relationships that a line manager has with their direct reports, understanding how a great leaders network is spread across the organisation and benchmarking the networks of the best leaders is all now possible. Supplying vital data and action oriented coaching advice helps organisations develop their own leaders.</p>, <p><strong>Where are we collaborating well, and where aren’t we?</strong></p>, <p><em>Figure 6: Measuring collaboration for individuals and teams.</em></p>, <p>Measuring collaboration has always been difficult, measuring changes in collaboration, virtually impossible, but ONA supplies data on the flows of information, the strength of relationships and the network activity of individuals and the teams and units they work in. Suddenly collaboration has gone from abstract and theoretical, to measurable and actionable.</p>, <p>ONA’s amazing ability to help identify all of these behaviors and activities and then monitor the changes in them is providing organizations all around the world with unique competitive advantages in identifying, developing and retaining top talent.</p>, <p>HR teams have focussed a lot on the formal structure and hierarchy of the organization, but with computational advances and innovative technologies in the market, it is finally possible to study the informal networks in an organization, at scale. If you could see the network of human activity that powers your organization, what do you think would be the first thing that it would reveal?</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>&lt;&lt;UPDATE &gt;&gt;</p>, <p>Thanks for all your feedback (and public and private messages), its great to hear about other people as excited as we are about ONA.</p>, <p>If you are interested in learning more about ONA from a practioners point of view, please check out this excellent piece from my good friend Antony Ebelle:</p>, <p>Please follow me for more regular updates on ONA....</p>]"
Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,86% of Executives Can’t Find Value in Analytics - Why not?,10. Tracey Smith,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/86-executives-cant-find-value-analytics-tracey-smith,"[<p>In April 2016, a McKinsey survey revealed that,</p>, <p>To be clear, we’re speaking of all analytics programs and not just those in any one functional area. So what went wrong? According to the McKinsey survey, the number one reason put forth by leaders is the need to design a structure to support analytics. Here are a few thoughts on their organizational comment.</p>, <p>When people come to me and ask advice about taking on a new leadership role in analytics, I always tell them to look at the org structure carefully. To whom does analytics report? Is the analytics team further down the org chart or much higher up? The higher up it resides, the more serious the company likely is about using analytics for decision-making.</p>, <p>When the function resides higher up, the leader of the analytics team has enough exposure and access to executives who have the “pull” to move projects forward. Gaining leadership support and the support of employees below these executives who likely need to reside on some of your projects, is much easier.</p>, <p>That said, you can still fail under this high-level structure in many ways. These failure modes exist regardless of where analytics reports. Here are a few:</p>, <p>If the analytics function resides further down, failure is not inevitable but it is more probable. However, I highly recommend putting an analytics leader in place who has a thick skin and is an absolute go-getter who deems failure to never be an option! This person will have to fight for the support he / she needs in order to move projects forward. This leader will need to lead by example and prove the value of analytics in order to get that support.</p>, <p>By proof, I don’t mean a “pie in the sky” PowerPoint deck about the theoretical benefits of analytics that anyone can drum up off the internet. I mean hard-core proof of analytical benefits using the company’s own data. Yes, that takes effort but we have our “go-getter / failure is not an option” leader, right?</p>, <p>This leader will need to “get out into the business” and speak to more layers of the organization than the analytics leader who reports higher up. This leader will need to “rally the troops” even if those troops are purely volunteers. It can be done.</p>, <p>Regardless of the levels, one main failure mode remains the most common one I see…</p>, <p><strong>There is no plan; there is no strategy.</strong></p>, <p>The analytics being conducted is “whatever lands on our desks.” The team is in firefighting mode with no time to plan. This isn’t true for all analytics teams, but it does seem common enough to mention.</p>, <p>Without a plan, some teams get caught in the very long duration of “trying to get ALL of our data in one place” or trying to be like Walmart and Amazon. Value will pass you by.</p>, <p>If you put a strategy in place, it’s quite the opposite approach. We are not concerned about ALL data. For 99% of companies, we are not trying to be Walmart or Amazon. We are concerned with defining what we need to know and concerned only with the data associated with that.

Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,Fantastic People Analysts - and where to find them,18. Sam Hill,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fantastic-people-analysts-where-find-them-sam-hill,"[<p>Consider this scenario:</p>, <p>You are responsible for executive recruitment at a serious organisation, probably listed on the FTSE 100, S&amp;P 500 or an equivalent national index.</p>, <p>And because they are a serious organisation they have made a strategic commitment to invest in a first class People Analytics proposition.</p>, <p>The first step, and your responsibility, is to find the right individual to head up, build and embed the function.</p>, <p>However, this presents a challenge – genuine, experienced People Analytics leaders are hard to find; there is no formal qualification or recognised career path – how do you find and attract the right individual?</p>, <p>One of the advisory services we offer at Workforce Dimensions is to support organisations in making strategic, data-driven HR appointments; so here are some tips on sourcing a leader, evangelist and steward for your People Analytics function.</p>, <p><strong>Don’t dilute the role</strong></p>, <p>If you want to attract the very best, the position holder should report directly into the CHRO. Possibly the CEO or COO, but almost certainly not the CIO (more on this in a moment).</p>, <p>This isn’t about a lack of seniority or a (perceived or actual) lack of decision-power, although this will inevitably limit the number of senior candidates you can attract; it’s about the scope of the role.</p>, <p>A great People Analytics proposition must reach across the full breadth of people actions, behaviours and configuration, so to have the leader of the function reporting into, for example the HR Director for Talent, would be restrictive and quite probably dysfunctional.</p>, <p><strong>Understand that People Analytics is not a sub-set of Management Information (MI)</strong></p>, <p>In my opinion, in broad terms, there are three capabilities required to deliver a robust People Analytics proposition. In summary:</p>, <p><em>Providing Data Foundations: </em></p>, <p><em>Generating Insight:</em></p>, <p><em>Communicating Insight:</em></p>, <p>My view is that communicating insight is vital for your People Analytics leader, generating insight is very important, and the provision of data foundations is a ‘nice to have’ (as long as they have access to these skills).</p>, <p>So in the context of this niche, I’d suggest MI is actually a sub-set of People Analytics; and if you accept this, why would have your People Analytics leader sitting within the silo of the CIO?</p>, <p><strong>Be open minded on qualification</strong></p>, <p>A practice that is becoming more prevalent, and one that I personally applaud, is the adoption of blind recruitment to help eliminate bias. Organisations can choose just how ‘blind’ they want to be; but many are moving beyond the realm of diversity, and removing university, and in some cases qualification from the initial stages of candidate selection.</p>, <p>So for the niche of People Analytics, where there is no specific qualification, why would we artificially introduce a requirement for a degree (or similar) in a vaguely related discipline?</p>, <p>This is unnecessary, restrictive and just a little lazy; similarly, why specify industry experience as an absolute requirement?</p>, <p>I’m not suggesting education and industry exposure are not factors; but there are many other more important considerations.</p>, <p><strong>Ask for advice – but be selective</strong></p>, <p>People Analytics is a specialist discipline, and as such it is likely that you are making your first appointment into this space; so it’s natural that you may seek advice and guidance. But where do you turn?</p>, <p>A recruitment agency may – or may not be the answer. The question is; do they have the appropriate expertise to be effective in this niche?</p>, <p>If they intend to passively take your brief, then use the questionable filters described above to form a shortlist of candidates drawn from a largely MI dominated database – then they won’t add value and they certainly won’t justify their fee.</p>, <p>However, if you can find an advisor who can demonstrate an understanding of People Analytics, will partner with you to craft a brief, develop a Job Description tailored to the requirements of this specific role, and who will support you by reviewing applications.</p>, <p>And if this partner will help you shape interview questions, conduct interviews, review delegate performance and offer advice on selection – then you have a trusted advisor, and I would suggest you would have shortened the odds of making the right hire.</p>, <p>________</p>, <p>So, you’ve reached the interview stage, you’ve tested for the capabilities outlined above (and embedded in the job description), and in the process assessed whether the individual would be a good fit in your organisation.</p>, <p>What else should you consider? Here are 2 suggestions:</p>, <p><strong>Assess how your prospective People Analytics leader will develop and embed the function</strong></p>, <p>I’m often asked which organisations ‘do people analytics well’. I’m hesitant to answer this question as many of the examples I could offer soon become time-expired. This is because success has been delivered on the back of a maverick individual who built a function, crafted great work, forged a reputation - and then continued their career elsewhere leaving no structure for ongoing success.</p>, <p>So, with this in mind, my advice is to probe how your potential senior hire will attract, mentor and coach a team of people analysts; and just as importantly, how will they educate the customer base to demand, and support investment in, a dedicated team of specialists?</p>, <p>Clearly I have a passion for the discipline, so I may be ‘partisan’ in my outlook, but I firmly believe that People Analytics is a critical enabler that will confirm HR as a strategic partner to the business, and therefore the proposition must be embedded into business as usual.</p>, <p>So yes, your lead player should be a visionary, but they must also take on a stewardship role and leave robust frameworks in place for those who will follow in their footsteps.</p>, <p><strong>Beware of the Dilettante</strong></p>, <p>Finally, here is a thought that has only recently developed in my mind – in fact while interviewing for a mid-level people analyst on behalf of a client.</p>, <p>One of the candidates under consideration gave text-book answers to almost every question asked of them, had a comprehensive knowledge of emerging trends and had clearly researched a raft of thought leaders in the People Analytics space.</p>, <p>However, when pressed for examples of well-constructed investigations that genuinely influenced workforce and business decisions, it was clear that this individual had limited personal experience of delivering positive outcomes; either as a practitioner or as a consultant.</p>, <p>In this case, it wasn’t a deal breaker; after all we weren’t trying to source a people analytics leader, and in overall terms this was a very impressive candidate</p>, <p>However, if you are responsible for recruitment at that FTSE 100 organisation and you are looking for that strategic hire to build and develop your people analytics function, I’d caution against recruiting someone who simply comments on events, you need someone who will shape them.</p>, <p>Be wary of the candidate who applauds everything, but creates nothing – beware the dilettante!</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> is Managing Consultant and Founder of <a href=""http://www.workforcedimensions.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Workforce Dimensions</a> who partner with organisations seeking to understand and maximise the contribution their people make to business imperatives.</p>, <p>Workforce Dimensions provides advisory, recruitment and educational services exclusively in the field of Strategic Workforce Planning and People Analytics.</p>, <p>Twitter: <a href=""http://twitter.com/Sam_Hill_WFD"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> | <a href=""http://twitter.com/WFDimensions"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Workforce Dimensions</a></p>]"
Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,"Developing a Talent Analytics function: Build, Buy or Borrow",19. Ben Eubanks,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/developing-talent-analytics-function-build-buy-borrow-ben-eubanks,"[<p><em>I'm currently in the midst of a research project examining how some of the best and brightest companies in the world hire people analytics talent. This is a part of that research. If you're interested in more details that don't make it into my blog or LinkedIn Pulse content, feel free to </em><a href=""http://mailto:ben.eubanks@lhra.io"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>reach out to me</em></a><em>.</em></p>, <p>Building a people analytics team for the first time isn't like hiring a new administrative assistant or a new accountant. In many cases, companies have never hired anyone for these types of roles, or they have limited experience hiring for the specific skill sets necessary for success. In the last eight months I have met with a variety of HR, talent, and learning leaders to understand more about how their organizations seek out, develop, and leverage these types of individuals. In the end the basic options for filling these roles are very similar to what we might expect, but there are interesting twists because of the uniqueness of where the role sits on the organizational chart.</p>, <p>In addition, building a need for analytics usage is similar to building the business case for strategic workforce planning. If someone walks in with a ""strategic workforce plan"" in a binder, drops it on your desk, and forgets about it, then they have failed at their goal. If the person in charge of this practice instead regularly checks the pulse of the organization's talent around hiring and development decisions, that's what is critical. In the end, it has to be a continuous, iterative process. It can't be static and based on a single snapshot in time, and that includes our discussion of talent analytics as well. It's not a destination, but an ongoing journey.</p>, <p>One key element to making the run at talent analytics stick within the organization is to adopt a more evidence-based approach to HR. When decisions of all types are filtered through the framework of evidence-based HR, it conditions the audience to always be looking for data to prove (or disprove) theory and conjecture. While there's nothing inherently wrong with opinions and ideas, it's always more powerful when you can demonstrate <strong>with evidence</strong> the potential results of a decision or direction. With that in mind, let's look at our three avenues for creating a powerful people analytics function: <a href=""http://lhra.io/blog/gig-economy-impact-talent-decisions/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">build, buy, or borrow</a>.</p>, <p>In the <a href=""http://hros.co/blog/2016/2/5/opower-how-we-use-data-to-optimize-our-talent-acquisition-team"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Opower case study</a> shared on the HR Open Source network, we see the company's gradual adoption of talent analytics and the power this has on the credibility and results achieved by the talent acquisition function. It's a fascinating read, and what I liked in particular was the explanation of how the company's talent team used existing resources to <strong>flex</strong> them into analytics roles.</p>, <p>While the team didn't have a ton of experience with analytics specifically, it was clear that each person knew the team, the company, and the mission well. This allowed them to back into what to track, what was important, and so on. Again, I highly recommend the case study because it includes before and after images of dashboards and measurement practices to provide insight into the transition.</p>, <p>This is an example of how companies can <strong>build talent analytics teams</strong> by flexing internal talent to meet the new demands.</p>, <p>There is quite a market for data scientists, and as Glassdoor's data shows, companies are trying to hire these workers to get on the analytics bandwagon. As part of this research project I have been examining data from a variety of companies. These are a few interesting examples of what companies are looking for in their talent analytics hires:</p>, <p>While many companies are hiring talent analytics teams, the requirements have some similarities and some differences, based on the company philosophy, industry, and maturity level.</p>, <p>This is an example of how companies can <strong>buy talent analytics teams</strong> by hiring for the key skills necessary for a strong measurement function.</p>, <p>I was speaking at the IBM HR Summit last fall in Boston, and an attendee told me this as part of her company's story of growth and maturity in its people analytics function. This discussion intrigued me immensely, because this is how we can scale HR analytics practices quickly without having to wait on training or education to catch up.</p>, <p>The company in question was just getting started with analytics and didn't have the budget to hire a dedicated person for the talent team. It was hard to prove an internal business case for talent analytics without having something to show for it, so she gained the support to use an internal person as a part-time resource, enabling the HR team to improve its credibility with data and drive results in support of organizational objectives.</p>, <p>This is an example of how companies can <strong>borrow other talent to build an analytics team</strong>, sharing internal resources as the function develops over time.</p>, <p><em><strong>For those of you at companies with a talent analytics function, I'd love to learn more about how you have made the journey. What direction did you take? What did you do right, or wrong, throughout the process?</strong></em></p>]"
Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,Why Analytics needs intuition and (rock) music,20. Thomas Rasmussen,http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-analytics-needs-intuition-rock-music-thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST,"[<p>In case you haven't seen <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film)"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Big Short</a>, Christian Bale plays <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Michael Burry</a> - a neurologist-turned-hedge-fund-manager who predicts the global housing crisis - and listens to (very loud Rock) music while analyzing data.</p>, <p>It made me smile because listening to music while analyzing data is widespread practice for researchers, financial analysts, and yes - folks doing People Analytics (and for IT experts coding). Those of you who have seen series like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSI:_Crime_Scene_Investigation"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CSI</a> may have noticed the scenes of people analyzing evidence while listening to music, that pays tribute to this, and cognitive psychology has for long accepted the role of intuition in expertise: experts also widely <em>feel</em> as part of their work, i.e. use their accumulated experience via intuition, and this includes areas like statistical analysis. Music helps focus the intuitive expertise. I've even heard people that have different preferences depending on the type of analysis they do ('I prefer Lounge for descriptive statistics and data exploration, but I do Metallica for regressions'). You may have seen some positioning 'analytics' as the opposite of '<em>feeling</em>' (and also as something for cold, logical people and eventually AI/software) but I actually argue that there is a place for intuition in (people) Analytics (and plenty of space for fun people too) - also for the people doing the analytics. In fact, Dave Ulrich and I argue that Analytics should supplement - not replace - intuition, experience, and business understanding in People Analytics in our 2015 <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090261615000443"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">paper</a>.</p>, <p>Some <a href=""https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2007/07/music-moves-brain-to-pay-attention-stanford-study-finds.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">research</a> from Stanford has looked into the role of music for analytics, and found three active ingredients:</p>, <p>'The research team showed that music engages the areas of the brain involved with <strong>paying attention</strong>, <strong>making predictions</strong> and <strong>updating the event in memory</strong>.'</p>, <p>People that do analytics as part of their job also recognize the 'flow' feeling they get, when deeply immersed in analysis, regressions, etc.: 'It's like really being one with the data, intuitively sensing multiple parallel patterns in the data, moderators that impact them etc., while applying hard logic and formulas at the same time'. So just like most experts truly enjoy what they are very good at (coding, professional sports, etc.) - with ease doing what seems so hard to the rest of us - analytics professionals get a lot of joy out of analyzing data, finding patterns and insights and it actually feels very joyful and intuitive (provided you are already an expert at the technical statistical elements of analytics). Recently, there's been some focus on all the different skills/roles needed for (People) Analytics: change agent, storyteller, business partner etc. - which are surely useful - but I'd recommend emphasis on really enjoying analytics, and my #1 interview question would be: ""What kind of music do you listen to when you analyze data?"". </p>, <p>So what kind of music works best? Well, no definitive answer to that, but it seems that it has to be something you enjoy, and maybe something with small periods of silence included (found in Techno, Rock, and Classical Music): ""Peak brain activity occurred during a short period of silence between musical movements - when seemingly nothing was happening""</p>, <p>And the implication for (People) Analytics? Let your experts use their expert intuition and Rock-on when they do their Analytics, as it's actually helpful, and makes their work more joyful - and maybe think twice before telling your kids to turn off their music while studying at home - perhaps it's you, who needs to turn it up instead.</p>]"

The 20 best HR Analytics articles: Jul & Aug 2017,People Analytics: What’s the big deal?,5. Keith McNulty,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-whats-big-deal-keith-mcnulty,"[<p>Someone asked me recently why they are seeing so much more hype and publishing around the subject of People Analytics. I thought it was a fair question. It's not like we only recently discovered we could analyze data about people. Psychologists and Sociologists have been doing that already for a long time. I've personally been analyzing data about people for at least the past 15 years.</p>, <p>So I understood their question to mean 'What's new?' What has changed that has suddenly propelled this topic onto the radar screens of CEOs, CHROs, academics, journalists and others who just want to learn more about it? Why are organizations suddenly setting up and growing dedicated People Analytics groups out of their limited scatterings of erstwhile workforce analysts?</p>, <p>Some people have suggested that organizations have reached a tipping point in volume where they can now regard their people data as 'big data', and that this now explains the fuss. I disagree. As Peter Capelli points out in a <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-big-data-in-hr"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">recent HBR article</a>, it's not really about 'big data'. It's erroneous to think that insight automatically follows from volume. Richness and variety of data is equally important, and structure is the key to almost all effective analytics. When analyzing any form of data, there is always a tension between, quantity, variability and dimensionality. Quantity in and of itself never wins out.</p>, <p>So what is it about? In my opinion the answer lies in technology - in the massive levels of digital growth and innovation that we have experienced in the past 5 years. Technology is giving us new ways of looking at the world around us and challenging accepted wisdoms like never before. As a few people have recently pointed out, 20 years ago we were told never to get in a car with a stranger and never to meet people on the internet. Now we are literally summoning strangers from the internet to get in their cars.</p>, <p>In the same way, technology is giving us ways to understand and analyze people that I would never have dreamed possible when I started out as a young psychometrician in the early noughties.</p>, <p>As is my wont, let me put some structure to this. In the past 5 years, technological development has offered up exciting opportunities to <strong>enrich the digital exhaust, </strong> <strong>obtain new people data to analyze</strong> and to<strong> analyze people data in new ways. </strong>Here are some examples of what I mean.</p>, <p>Many organizations are experiencing a better quality and richer digital exhaust in recent years. The quality and richness of the data imprint of members and employees is vastly superior to the situation even 5 years ago. This is due to:</p>, <p>The past 5 years has seen the realization by organizations and entrepreneurs that people data is a valuable asset that can be harvested and harnessed by new technology. This has led to exciting innovations both in how to capture this data and in how to offer it to potential consumers. Here are some current examples of this.</p>, <p>All this rich exhaust and new data wouldn't have been much use to us 5 years ago. The word 'data scientist' was just coined, and the majority of analysts were limited by the size of their processor or hard drive and the UI limitations of Microsoft Excel or SPSS. Now a whole host of technology has entered the fray which offer up a wealth of capability.</p>, <p>We are in the midst of a genuine paradigm shift in how we gather and analyze people data, and it's the technology that has taken us here. Even though many are still trying to wrap their heads around such a rapidly moving space, there is no doubt that it's a big deal, and it will continue to be for some time.</p>, <p><em>I lead McKinsey's internal People Analytics and Measurement function. Originally I was a Pure Mathematician, then I became a Psychometrician. I am passionate about applying the rigor of both those disciplines to complex people questions.

David Green,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-reasons-why-people-analytics-central-future-hr-david-green,"[<p>The Danish physicist and Nobel Prize winner Niels Bohr once mused, “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.”</p>, <p>This is partly why I have finally given up predicting at the start of each season that Liverpool will win the Premier League, and have demurred in forecasting that 2017 will be the year that people analytics will go mainstream.</p>, <p>There are many reasons why people analytics has not yet crossed the chasm and widened its adoptees beyond visionaries to pragmatists.</p>, <p>Firstly, like pretty much any business trend, growth tends to be exponential rather than linear.</p>, <p>Secondly, and perhaps more pertinently, many professionals (in particular Chief Human Resource Leaders and HR Leaders) have still not grasped what people analytics is (clue – it’s not reporting) and the potential it offers to drive better business outcomes as well as improved employee experience and wellbeing.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, there are reasons for optimism as a number of indicators suggest exponential growth is close. As such I feel safe in writing that in the next three to five years, analytics will become a core and central discipline of HR.</p>, <p>Here are six reasons why I believe that people analytics is shifting from the periphery to the centre of the HR agenda.</p>, <p>We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution.

The 20 best HR Analytics articles: Jul & Aug 2017,Workforce planning that really is strategic,11. Alec Levenson & Alexis Fink,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/workforce-planning-really-strategic-alec-levenson,"[<p>(co-authored with Alexis Fink)</p>, <p>Most workforce planning efforts are fairly short sighted and narrow, and could more accurately be called 12 month hiring plans. Strategic workforce planning promises to deliver greater value by using a longer time horizon and a talent supply chain approach. The problem, however, is that even then it’s still too narrowly focused on the low hanging fruit of butts in seats. In order for HR to really raise its game, workforce planning has to be much more focused on addressing holistically the systemic talent issues that impede business performance.</p>, <p>Workforce planning traditionally has meant annual forecasts for how many people are needed in a role, with the forecasts happening less than six months before the end of the fiscal year as part of the budget-setting process. Strategic workforce planning focuses farther out on how the business’ needs will evolve over two or more years, to anticipate and solve talent gaps that are too hard to address in six months or less. For example, strategic workforce planning often includes identifying roles staffed with a large number of older people who are on the verge of retirement, and making plans in advance to ensure a stable talent pipeline of people to succeed them. Another common example is identifying key areas where the business plans to grow and calculating how to meet the talent demands and avoid shortages.</p>, <p>That type of analytics is essential to avoid big gaps in the number of people needed to do the work. But that only focuses on who does the work, not how it gets done. Most of the people-related issues that arise from the work design cannot be easily addressed through adjusting headcount. The “how” is essential for truly strategic workforce planning because it opens the door to reconsidering the barriers to strategy execution that are rooted in how roles and responsibilities are designed, and the competency and recruiting profiles used to evaluate how talent contributes to organizational success.</p>, <p>There is a great opportunity for heads of talent analytics and their teams to play an important role positioning their organizations for success through this work. But it requires a different orientation than thinking about the problem as workforce planning, one which looks beyond the job to the system of work in which the job is embedded. This includes taking into consideration business objectives such as capacity utilization, cost minimization and more. For people working in talent analytics, the issue is not much different from the business coming to you and asking for help on how to optimize productivity and employee engagement. The challenge is learning how to do so by looking at the bigger picture of the system of work, and incorporating perspectives such as job design and organization design which go beyond the data typically available for talent analytics.</p>, <p><strong>“Strategic” workforce planning today.</strong> Strategic workforce planning focuses on existing or new roles, matching up labor forecasts with analysis of the supply of people to fill those roles. For example, consider account managers at a bank. Strategic workforce planning would look at where the banks’ services are growing the most, taking into account which lines of business and geographies are expected to have the greatest increase in demand. It would then plan on hiring more account managers where the forecasted gap is highest.</p>, <p>Yet forecasting the number of account managers and where they need to grow the fastest does not address any root causes of performance that come from how the work is designed. The ultimate goal is not necessarily avoiding vacancies in the account manager role. Instead, the bigger picture is how the bank delivers its products and services in a cost effective way. When talent analytics leaders take as given the way roles are currently defined, they perpetuate inefficiencies in the work design that can lead to hiring people who are over- or underqualified for the work, and overpaying for skills which aren’t needed or underpaying for ones that are. Any future looking strategy must take into account things like redesigning the work to increase efficiency and increasing opportunity for automation as a disrupter of work processes.</p>, <p>In the bank’s case, the ultimate objectives are customer service, selling more high-margin products and services, and getting customers to use the bank for a greater proportion of their banking needs. Customer service is important because it keeps people from leaving, lowering the acquisition cost of the bank’s assets. Higher-margin products and services increase the bank’s profitability. Getting customers to use the bank for a greater share of their banking needs increases retention and lowers acquisition costs. </p>, <p>Hiring more and better account managers <em>may</em> help the bank improve its performance along those dimensions. Account managers definitely contribute to customer service, higher-margin sales, and cross-selling. Yet they are only one contributor to improved business performance. Improving those business metrics often requires other changes in the work system that complement what account managers do. </p>, <p>Take customer service, for example. Account managers are important contributors to the customer experience, but they alone do not define it. The phone system the customer first encounters when calling in, the employees who interact with the customer both in person and over the phone, and other employees in the branch aside from the account managers also contribute to customer service. Just focusing on the account managers alone through traditional workforce planning almost always won’t be enough to meet the bank’s objectives for customer service. You have to consider the broader ways the organizational system creates the customer experience.</p>, <p><strong>Apply job analysis for better workforce planning.</strong> The fundamental problem for talent analytics leaders is that “strategic” workforce planning focuses only on the number of people needed to fill anticipated vacancies. Taking a longer horizon look and considering the talent supply chain are useful innovations over traditional workforce planning, and those significant advances in the field have increased its relevance and contribution in recent years. Yet they are still too narrowly focused on the job as it currently exists. A much better approach diagnoses the job design to find the bottlenecks to performance, and uses that analysis to design more holistic solutions.</p>, <p>Consider the example of health care. Doctors are the most expensive, highest-skilled labor in healthcare delivery and the main bottlenecks to improved, cost-effective performance. Having doctors spend more time on patient care is key to improving health outcomes in many settings, yet typically it is too expensive to just add more doctors. That’s why the health care system centuries ago created the role of nurse, a less expensive counterpart to doctors. For the longest time, nurses were the main workforce planning solution used to solve the problem of increasing the number of patients treated per hour each doctor works.</p>, <p>However, in more recent decades nursing shortages have pushed the health care industry to innovate further, increasing the use of roles such as physician assistant to free up both doctors and nurses to treat more patients per hour. The insight of creating the role of physician assistant never came from a traditional workforce planning approach. It also never would have emerged from what passes for the current state of the art in “strategic” workforce planning, which focuses on existing roles. Instead, the analysis that led to creating the physician assistant role required a holistic diagnosis of the health care delivery system and the constraints on both doctors’ and nurses’ time. </p>, <p>The key is expanding the analysis from focusing on vacancies and hours worked in one job (role) to the set of roles that make up a complete work process. So rather than focus solely on the physicians and how many hours they work, the diagnosis hones in on the number of patients served per hour the physician works. The key question is how to optimize the number of patients treated per hour by the entire system of roles, not just the single role of physician. If the total labor cost per patient served can be lowered, then the total number of patients treated per hour can be expanded more cost effectively than by simply adding additional physician hours. </p>, <p>The larger point here is that the focus needs to start with the business objectives. In a healthcare system, for example, the strategic objectives are treating patients effectively and efficiently to minimize costs and optimize health outcomes. Workforce planning focuses only on jobs, not the other parts of the system that need to be optimized. In a hospital, capacity utilization (keeping the beds full) is a critical objective so that the fixed costs of running the building can be spread over as many patients per day as possible. In a medical practice, the same principle applies: keep the exam rooms full and minimize the amount of time needed to treat each patient by the doctors.</p>, <p>The key for talent analytics leaders who want to improve the strategic relevance of workforce planning is to take the perspective of a forward thinking business partner. This means going beyond looking at the existing jobs and engaging in the “what if” questions around how best to optimize the work design. In the medical practice case, taking this approach broadens the scope of the analysis to include questions such as “how can we free up doctors to spend more time on effective patient care per hour?” Viewed this way, the solutions can come from many different approaches, not all of which involve traditional health care jobs. For example, electronic medical records cut down on the amount of time doctors have to spend reading paper records on patient care, while increasing the amount of information doctors can access while treating each patient; this happens through aggregation of medical records that previously were located in each doctor’s office and not instantaneously accessible by other physicians treating the same patient. Advocating for electronic medical records would never emerge from today’s strategic workforce planning approaches, and yet any conversations about implementing electronic medical records should include talent analytics representatives because of the new jobs needed to make it happen.</p>, <p><strong>Take a holistic view of the team, not just one job.</strong> The main message is that workforce planning has to go beyond the traditional focus on jobs and instead focus on teams. And rather than think about the work one role at a time, talent analytics leaders need to consider specific tasks and bottlenecks to performance that are rooted in parts of the job. </p>, <p>Going back to our health care example, even today with the team approach of doctor, nurse and physician assistant, physician time is still the bottleneck to improved performance in many cases. If we could just free up doctors to spend more time with patients, efficiencies and patient outcomes could be improved further. The roles of nurse and physician assistant evolved as ways to take parts of the health care delivery system out of doctors’ hands and give them to others with different skillsets but who nonetheless can perform a lot of skilled tasks without needing a doctor in the room at the same time. The question is what additional changes or innovations can free up doctors further.</p>, <p>The most recent answer is medical scribes. These are people who accompany doctors as they do their patient visits, transcribing the details of the patient’s condition and the doctor’s instructions for care. Using scribes frees up doctors from the very time consuming task of writing up the notes from the patient visit. </p>, <p>The job of medical scribe would never have been identified by today’s strategic workforce planning approaches. Instead, a systems diagnostic of the work and the challenge of doctors’ time being very expensive led health care organizations to realize there was another way to cheaply solve the bottleneck of physician time. The solution lay in adding lower-priced skilled labor that frees up the doctor to spend more time on what only they can uniquely do: diagnose and treat patients. The job of physician assistant, like nurse, is a traditional extender role which requires medical training and decision making. The scribe role, in contrast, broadens the focus to include non-clinical roles. Medical scribes need to be skilled enough to write down accurately what they hear, but they do not have to be trained and certified as medical providers to add value. Medical scribe roles are a lot like court reporter roles: court reporters have to know enough about the legal process to record everything accurately, yet they are not as highly skilled on legal issues as lawyers or even law associates. </p>, <p>The team-based diagnostic approach takes into account how the work is performed, and considers reconfiguring tasks across jobs to make more robust talent systems. These more robust systems can increase flexibility and efficiency by identifying the optimal way for the organization as a whole to function. Take for example the different tasks that have to be performed in supply chain operations. Optimizing the supply chain includes determining which tasks and roles can be outsourced when there are suppliers that have expertise that complements or even exceeds what the organization can do on its own. Yet the decision on outsourcing is not a simple one of the cost of services and availability of people to provide them. Even more critical is how those services fit into the creation and preservation of the company’s competitive advantage.</p>, <p>Evolution in organizational size, complexity, product offerings, competitive threats, and technology combine to create a dynamic reality for organizations. The perfect solution two years ago may be suboptimal today. Something impractical two years ago may offer significant competitive advantage today. For example, in the near future, the role of scribe may further evolve to be completed by a virtual digital assistant, as voice recognition capability improves. Workforce needs are not static. To succeed, organizations must continually adapt and adjust their workforce planning.  </p>, <p><em>This post is based in part on my book </em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Analytics-Advancing-Organizational-Effectiveness/dp/1626560552"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Strategic Analytics</em></a><em>.</em></p>, <p>Related posts:</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/talent-organizational-capability-alec-levenson"" target=""_blank"">Talent is an organizational capability</a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beware-hr-analytic-barbarians-alec-levenson"" target=""_blank"">Beware the HR analytic barbarians</a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/high-performance-work-design-trumps-employee-alec-levenson"" target=""_blank"">High performance work design trumps employee engagement</a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-solemnly-swear-hr-data-analytics-manifesto-alec-levenson"" target=""_blank"">HR data and analytics manifesto</a></p>]"

The biggest accusations (apart from the obvious) included creating a culture that made it hard for women to succeed and climb the corporate ladder. His departure (or termination) in 2016 was followed with a promise from the network to do better and they embarked on one of their first ever documented People Analytics programs*.</p>, <p>**********************************************************************</p>, <p>I build People Analytics models everyday. Broadly, the models I build fall into two categories and for the purpose of this blog let me call them:</p>, <p>So how are they different? Both can be predictive. Both can solve business questions. Both can involve machine learning algorithms. However, performance models require a variable that is a proxy to employee performance and this makes building them incredibly complex and risky. <u>The validity of the model depends entirely on the practitioner's definition of employee performance and the reliability of the associated data points</u>.</p>, <p>Let me use Fox News as an example of how building Performance Models can be really tricky. To counter their hitherto terrible hiring practices, they introduced a machine-learning algorithm that sought out the best potentials to promote. The model would go through years of historic data to identify the common characteristics of Fox News employees who succeeded which would then be used in future promotion decisions. That sounds like great news, right? The model would remove human bias against gender and race and choose candidates purely on merit.</p>, <p>To build the model, their scientists defined success for an employee as ""staying there for five years and being promoted twice"". It's the first step in an Employee Performance model. They then trained their model to identify what these ""successful"" employees had in common which would in turn be applied to the current pool of applicants to find the best people to promote. It all went awfully wrong. The model built to help eliminate gender bias ended up systematically removing women from its selection process. Because many women in the past were not allowed to climb the corporate ladder - and therefore did not make it to the ""successful employee"" training data set. <strong>The model failed the moment scientists chose the wrong proxy for performance</strong>. This for me is a sublime example of how tricky building Performance Models can be.</p>, <p>Practitioners often choose from the following four categories (examples of each can be found below) of employee performance metrics when building performance models. Remember, Fox News used a tenure of 5 years as a way of defining performance.</p>, <p>I have to admit - choosing reliable proxies from data that companies usually collect on performance is hard. In my experience, I have had to deal with:</p>, <p>It's not all doom and gloom. Building good performance models is not impossible. Depending on which side the performance metric exists on the model, here are some things you can do:</p>, <p><em>So how would you estimate employee performance? Have you built any models and how would you circumnavigate the issues I mentioned in this blog? What advice could you offer practitioners in the space? Comment!</em></p>, <p><em>*The methods used by the Fox people analytics program were published in the book by Cathy O'Neil, titled Weapons of Math Destruction.</em></p>]"

The 20 best HR Analytics articles: Jul & Aug 2017,Organizational Network Analysis: Going Beyond Email,15. Philip Arkcoll,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/organizational-network-analysis-going-beyond-email-philip-arkcoll,"[<p>Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) is fast proving itself as an invaluable tool with a broad set of applications in people analytics, ranging from organizational design, to operational efficiency and change management. Data on employee relationships within an organization can provide rich insight into how teams and departments operate and share information.</p>, <p>A large portion of the analyses in this space are now performed using data gathered from email networks, extracted from tools like Microsoft Exchange. These networks infer employee relationships by assuming that sending or receiving an email indicates some connection between two or more people. The more emails sent or received, the stronger the connections might be.</p>, <p>Email networks are of course a great source of network data but when used alone they provide an incomplete picture. The number of digital tools used in most workplaces has ballooned and email has decreased sharply as a relative portion of digital collaboration. The average enterprise organization now uses <a href=""https://www.skyhighnetworks.com/cloud-computing-trends-2016/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">100s of different cloud tools</a>, including new communication products like Slack and Microsoft Teams, which aim to replace email. Each of these new tools contains data on one, if not multiple employee networks. Even tools like Sales CRMs, ticket management systems, source code repositories and intranets contain rich sets network data.</p>, <p>Below is a diagram of six networks collected from different tools within the same organization. Each diagram shows a completely different set of relationships. It's clear from this that there are a large number of strong employee relationships that exist in some networks but don't show up in email.</p>, <p><strong>Diagram showing some of the many networks that exist within tools in a single organization</strong></p>, <p>If you were analyzing something like <em>the growth of employee networks during an onboarding process</em>, it would be misleading to look at only the email network above. You might incorrectly infer that certain groups of individuals don’t have any internal networks, when really they are just using a variety of different tools to collaborate.</p>, <p>In organizations we’ve analyzed, as many as 30% of employees may not send any email for months at a time and this percentage seems to be increasing. Our research indicates that email tends to be heavily used by more senior managers but that most team members make far greater use of other tools for collaboration.</p>, <p>It’s also worth thinking about the nature of the relationship indicated by each type of network. Email is a broadcast communication tool and it’s relatively common that large numbers of people are included in threads. Email networks tend to be very dense as a result. Everyone is connected to everyone else! But being included in an email thread may not indicate any real working relationship. On the other hand, a network from a document management tool such as OneDrive or Dropbox, shows people who have actively worked together on the same documents. They’ve actually edited or reviewed each other’s work. This is clearly a far stronger indication of a collaborative relationship!</p>, <p>The advantage of email network data is that it’s relatively easily accessible and simple to process. In many cases, however, it is not the best or only source you should consider. It’s worth taking time to think about which networks are best suited to each particular analysis. For some analyses, it makes sense to use multiple networks together to get a clearer global picture of an organization.</p>]"
