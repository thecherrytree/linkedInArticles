David R. Green,"May 7, 2019",The best HR and People Analytics articles of April 2019,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-april-2019-david-green/,"[<p>The term ‘Golden Age’ was first popularised in Ancient Greece and is defined as a period in a field of endeavour when great tasks were accomplished. As Amit Mohindra writes in the article of the month, this can certainly be applied to the field of quantum physics in the first 30 years of the 20th Century. Like Amit, I wonder whether history will come to recognise that we are currently in the midst of a similar halcyon period for people analytics.</p>, <p>Certainly, my experiences in April auger well and confirm that the field of people analytics continues to gather momentum, is broadening and deepening its scope and is increasing its impact both in terms of business outcomes and employee experience. This was evident in the Wharton People Analytics (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflections-wharton-people-analytics-conference-2019-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">see key reflections</a>) and <a href=""https://pafow.com/london19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW London</a> (see a selection of takeaways from Michael Carty [<a href=""https://www.xperthr.com/people-analytics/2019/04/30/strategic-people-analytics-in-action/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>], Pauli Dahlbom [<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-future-work-london-day-1-summary-pauli-dahlbom/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>] and Hans Donckers [<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-challenges-future-people-analytics-hans-donckers/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>]) conferences that bookended April. It can also be seen throughout the 2019 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends report, which was launched in the middle of April.</p>, <p>Before we dive into the articles selected this month, I’ve got a small favour to ask of readers. As the trailer below explains, I’m launching the Digital HR Leaders Podcast on myHRfuture on 14th May. In each episode, I’ll be speaking to a senior HR leader who is driving transformation in their organisations, as well as other acknowledged experts in the field on how HR can prepare for the future and what HR leaders need to do to prepare for the Future of Work.</p>, <p>The small favour I’d ask of readers is i) to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFgEZIXtLik"" target=""_blank"">watch the trailer</a>, then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coming-soon-digital-hr-leaders-podcast-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">read the article</a> and <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/subscribe"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">subscribe to the podcast</a>, ii) <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coming-soon-digital-hr-leaders-podcast-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">share the article</a> with your friends and colleagues. As ever, your support is much appreciated.</p>, <p>Now on with the countdown for April…</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A fascinating and educational piece as ever from the cerebral <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a> in which he ponders whether the emergence of people analytics in the first 20 years of the current century can be compared to the rise of quantum physics in the first 30 years of the 20th Century. It’s a tantalising thought especially as 17 of the 29 people featured in the photo below from the fifth Solvay Conference (a regular gathering of physicists and chemists to collaborate and share – rather like PAFOW or the Wharton People Analytics Conference?) in 1927 went on to win Nobel Prizes. Will we see a similar flood of winners from the people analytics field? Only time will tell…</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>112 pages organised into three main sections dealing with the Future of the Workforce, the Future of the Organisation and the Future of HR and with essays on each of the ten trends identified for 2019. The Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends for 2019 is the usual absorbing read. For those working in the people analytics space, the discipline is not called out individually as one of the ten trends – it was joint #1 last year. I see this as a sign that the field has matured as data and analytics is central to most if not all of the ten trends identified for 2019. The whole report is worth a read, but the essays on ‘From employee experience to human experience: Putting meaning back into work’, ‘Organisational performance: It’s a team sport’ and ‘Learning in the flow of life’ are especially essential.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: </em></strong><em>When experience is bottom-up and personal, it becomes focused on “human experience” (Source: Deloitte Analysis)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It’s become almost cliché to say the toughest challenge in any digital transformation isn’t the technology — it’s the people. The underlying assumption is that most employees don’t understand what’s coming and are resistant to change. That myth is busted in a fascinating new study of 6,500 business leaders and 11.000 workers, which suggests leaders are seriously underestimating their people. The study finds workers are ""<em>much more eager to embrace change and learn new skills than their employers gave them credit for</em>.” The article goes on to describe how employers can better help their workforce with two recommendations really resonating: i) Create a learning culture, and ii) Engage the workforce in the transition instead of herding them into it.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: </em></strong><em>Six forces shaping the future of work (Source: Created from Fuller et al, Harvard Business Review)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A terrific read from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> in which he espouses the need for HR to play an active role in the dilemmas arising from the potential impact of AI (“should AI be built to predict an outcome or mimic human behaviour?”). As Boudreau explains, the latter will often be faster, cheaper and more tempting, but may obscure important values, tradeoffs, and biases. He goes on to advocate that AI gives HR an opportunity to understand these dilemmas, articulate the tradeoffs and lead – not just when it comes to using AI in HR but throughout the organisation.  </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> describes, work is increasingly not just accomplished by full-time, part-time, or contracted workers, but also through automation and technology. This forms the basis of his article, which presents his methodology (see <strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong>) for a shift in thinking from workforce to worktask planning. This entails routine and standard tasks being allocated to technology and automation with people being assigned strategic, creative and unique responsibilities. This shift means HR professionals and people analytics teams need to broaden their horizon from a sole focus on full- and part- time employees to incorporate contractors, technology and automation too. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: </em></strong><em>A model for Worktask Planning (Source: Dave Ulrich)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> outlines a common challenge that is frequently experienced by People Analytics leaders - identifying value in People Analytics Projects. Leveraging the <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/nine-dimensions"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nine Dimensions in People Analytics Model</a> Jonathan and I co-created to help clients navigate this challenge led us to identify seven questions that People Analytics leaders should be asking themselves to ensure they’re on the right path to success. These questions cover areas such as leadership, ethics, governance and the levels of data literacy amongst HR business partners. The article also provides access to <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/survey"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a short survey that will help you identify your current level of excellence in People Analytics</a>. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4</em></strong><em>: The recommended composition for a ‘Board for People Analytics,’ which increases awareness of and provides direction for people analytics (Source: Jonathan Ferrar)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A fascinating read about how the HR team plays a pivotal role in keeping Amazon’s fabled Day 1 culture alive, which Jeff Bezos believes is crucial in enabling the company to continue to innovate and remain customer focused. The article covers Amazon’s agile ‘two-pizza’ team design, Single-Threaded Owner (STO) methodology, use of ONA to evaluate team structures (see example in <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>), practices to enable adaptive space and much more. This article comes from <a href=""https://www.hrps.org/resources/people-strategy-journal/Spring2019/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">SHRM’s spring 2019 People + Strategy magazine</a>, which is devoted to articles on ONA and advancing adaptive space. I highly recommend getting hold of a copy and enjoying other articles from the likes of Michael Arena, Mary Uhl-Bien, Rob Cross, Anna Tavis, Kristin Supancich, John Healy and Debra R. France. It’s an absolute treasure trove of insights. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>Execution Network and reasons for slow decision-making (Source: Galeti et al, SHRM People + Strategy Journal, Spring 2019)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a> shares with me his two-year journey of scaling people analytics at Capital One including insights on i) how he grew the team from 25 to 75 people, ii) how and why he developed a Centre of Excellence (see <strong><em>FIG 6)</em></strong>, iii) his philosophy on hiring and developing the team, iv) the dual focus on creating business impact as well as supporting employee experience and career development, v) his key responsibilities as leader plus his views on enablers of success. Guru has built one of the leading people analytics functions on the planet, so there is plenty to learn from here.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 6: </em></strong><em>Reasons to create a Centre of Excellence for People Analytics (Source: Guru Sethupathy)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This article documents the findings of a fascinating study by Google’s People Analytics team to understand the impact of distributed work on teams in areas such as well-being, performance and connectedness, before providing some recommendations to keep those things consistent.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The May-June edition of Harvard Business Review contains a trio of excellent articles on the state of recruiting in the wake of the use of social media, technology and algorithms. Two of these articles are by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-cappelli-14936a3/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cappelli</a> and simply have to be read. In the first article, Cappelli eschews the trend for “passive” candidates highlighting that there’s no evidence to suggest these candidates perform better, that the approach marginalises talented internal candidates, costs more and is largely unproven. In the second article, Cappelli is similarly scornful about the risks of using predictive algorithms for hiring. A sobering but important read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> writes in his latest appraisal of the dynamics affecting the market, the evolution of employee engagement continues to gather pace. He reminisces that it was only ten years ago that over 60% of companies didn’t survey their employees at all, and those that did only did it once a year. Now, a large number of companies have created the ability for workers to provide continuous feedback and the emphasis has shifted towards taking action – invariably via managers - as Josh outlines in <strong><em>FIG 7</em></strong> below. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 7: </em></strong><em>Process for taking action on insights from engagement feedback (Source: Josh Bersin)</em> </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock/"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a> paints a familiar picture of counterproductive employee engagement surveys including failure to measure what matters, analysis paralysis and no action on issues workers care most about. Fortunately, things don’t have to be this way and Bock outlines four steps companies can take to ensure efforts to solicit employee feedback don’t come back to haunt them.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As Culture Amp CEO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/didierelzinga/"" target=""_blank"">Didier Elzinga</a> writes in this insightful piece, CEOs are increasingly seeking competitive advantage through the ability of their organisation to take people and grow them faster and better than anybody else – and they’re turning to their CHROs to achieve this. The five questions Didier outlines that CEOs should ask their CHROs cover areas including: inclusion, engagement, leadership capability and employee experience at key touchpoints. A mandatory read for any current or aspiring CHRO.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’ve always enjoyed <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>’s articles as not only do they tackle interesting and important topics in people analytics, but they are invariably also rather provocative. That’s certainly the case with Max’s latest piece penned together with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-holdstock-09204239/"" target=""_blank"">James Holdstock</a>, which presents the case against the use of flight risk models because the authors feel they are creepy and open to abuse by employers. Whilst the scene painted here is contrary to what I’ve seen from the organisations I’ve worked with it is relatively certain that people analytics will at some point experience its own ‘Cambridge Analytica’ moment.  As such, as a community we must continue to put ethics and people analytics for good at the forefront remembering it’s not enough to just decide whether a model is ethical, but also how it is going to be used and applied. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Nudge theory dictates that the best way to drive change in a complex organisation is through a series of small incremental changes, which will consequently deliver significant and substantial business results. The theory was popularised by Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler, who stole the show at the recent Wharton People Analytics Conference in Philadelphia. In tribute to Professor Thaler, I’ve collected four recent articles highlighting the growth of nudges and behavioural economics in the workplace. Much of the attention in this area is focused on the work <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock/"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a> is doing with his new company Humu, and his interview with Yale describes how behavioural science, combined with an understanding of human feeling and careful attention to privacy, can help organisations run better. The second article comes from Humu’s <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanie-m-tignor-056a10104/"" target=""_blank"">Stephanie Tignor</a> and is adapted from her enthralling presentation at Wharton PAC (see also <strong><em>FIG 8</em></strong>). Next, an excellent long read in People Management really captures the essence of how nudge theory can help persuade people to change behaviour.  Finally, McKinsey outlines six areas to consider before setting up a nudge unit with two covering how to demonstrate impact and the critical topic of ethics.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8: </em></strong><em>Having a bad manager can actually make you more likely to stay at your job (Source: Stephanie Tignor)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As the Wharton PAC and PAFOW conferences both demonstrated, the rise of data-driven diversity and inclusion continues to gather pace. This is a good thing as people analytics has the potential to finally unlock the business value of D&amp;I. These four articles provide further evidence. First, Turban et al outline their fascinating research, which found that beliefs about gender diversity create a self-fulfilling cycle. Countries and industries that view gender diversity as important capture benefits from it. Those that don’t, don’t. In the second article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryyoung4/"" target=""_blank"">Mary Young</a> explores how firms are increasingly combining traditional HR data and performance metrics with previously untapped data sources to measure inclusion and track its progress over time. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drtomaschamorro/"" target=""_blank"">Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic</a> outlines three factors that make some leaders more committed to diversity than others. Finally, Peakon’s excellent new Heartbeat series delves into data from 60,000 employees under 3,000 managers, across 43 countries to answer the tantalising question: <em>How do female-led companies differ from male-led companies?</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’ve been doing a lot of research on podcasts in readiness for the launch of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coming-soon-digital-hr-leaders-podcast-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Digital HR Leaders</a> on 14th May. The absolute masters of this genre from a HR themed perspective are <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattalder/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Alder</a>. I could have picked any episode of Adam’s mesmerising Worklife podcast but really enjoyed his take on playing to your strengths – at the right time. Matt Alder has overseen over 180 episodes of his consistently excellent Recruiting Future Podcast. The pick from April has to be this deep dive into the world of recruiting automation. I can also recommend <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsschmidt/"" target=""_blank"">Lars Schmidt</a>’s excellent new 21st Century HR Podcast, with this episode seeing him reunited with his HR Open Source sparring partner <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambrosiavertesi/"" target=""_blank"">Ambrosia Vertesi</a> for insights on how she scaled people teams and infrastructure at Hootsuite and Duo Security.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Jason Averbook is one of the most knowledgeable, lively and most interesting speakers on the circuit, so this video of his masterclass at the recent People Matters Tech HR conference in Singapore on how HR leaders can build a holistic digital experience is definitely worth a watch.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It’s perhaps a good sign that the growth in people analytics has finally seen the addition of ‘People Analytics for Dummies’ to the long-running series of similarly titled how-to guides. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcwest/"" target=""_blank"">Mike West</a>, the author, is a seriously good egg and has been in the people analytics space longer than most. He has helped large and small companies alike in setting up successful people analytics functions, so has a lot of knowledge to impart. As such this book is a good starting point for anyone ready to dip into the deep end of people analytics. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>For the third consecutive year, I made the pilgrimage to Philadelphia for the Wharton People Analytics Conference. The conference deserves its lofty reputation, and despite the high bar set in 2017 and 2018, this year’s event was the best yet. My reflections on the two days feature the likes of Richard Thaler, Allyson Felix, Marcus Buckingham and Deloitte's CEO Cathy Engelbert along with the Wharton team of Adam Grant, Cade Massey and Laura Zarrow. The topics covered in Philadelphia were diverse with three themes coming to the fore: Diversity and Inclusion, Organisational Network Analysis and Nudges. I strongly recommend that everyone working in or interested in people analytics should try and get along to Wharton PAC at least once in their careers.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’d also like to offer a big thank you to HRE and the HR Technology Conference team for including me in their inaugural <a href=""http://hrexecutive.com/top-100/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Top 100 HRTech Influencers</strong></a><strong> </strong>list, which was announced last week. I should say that I'm typically not a huge fan of lists like these as they can be a bit arbitrary and subjective - for example my list of favourite albums (e.g. Low, The Stone Roses [30 years old last week], This Is Big Audio Dynamite [see below], London Calling etc) is likely to be completely different to most others.</p>, <p>However, this list is a pretty solid one and features genuine giants of our industry like Josh Bersin, Adam Grant, Dave Ulrich, Diane Gherson, Jason Averbook and Laszlo Bock. The list is a real feather in the cap for Insight222 and myHRfuture too as it features three of our team – Jonathan Ferrar and Al Adamsen as well as me. <a href=""http://hrexecutive.com/top-100/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>You can check out the full list here</strong></a>.</p>, <p>I’ll be chairing and/or speaking about people analytics, data-driven HR and the <em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</em> model at the following events until the end of October 2019. </p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>David is a globally respected writer, speaker, conference chair, and executive consultant on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

David R. Green,"April 15, 2019",Reflections on the Wharton People Analytics Conference 2019,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflections-wharton-people-analytics-conference-2019-david-green/,"[<p>The most successful female Olympian sprinter in history, a Nobel Prize winner and the CEO of Deloitte. The sixth edition of the Wharton People Analytics Conference provided a heady mix of outstanding speakers, cutting-edge insights, ground-breaking innovation and plenty to inspire a passionate and knowledgeable sell-out crowd.</p>, <p>In his opening remarks, <strong>Cade Massey</strong> encapsulated the two key drivers as to why he, <strong>Adam Grant</strong>, <strong>Laura Zarrow</strong> and the Wharton team created the conference - to share ideas and to build community. This is something the team has achieved with aplomb.</p>, <p>This was the third successive year I’ve attended Wharton PAC and incredibly, given the high bar set by the first two, the 2019 edition was the best yet.</p>, <p>The three main themes of the conference for me were diversity and <strong>inclusion</strong> (you cannot succeed with the former without the latter), the (mainly still as yet untapped) power of <strong>networks</strong>, and the use of <strong>nudges</strong> to drive better decisions and behavioural change. Throughout the two days, the majority of speakers outlined how one or a combination of these three themes (allied to people analytics) can help propel improvements in both business performance and employee experience/wellbeing.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>…remarked Nobel Prize winner and originator of the ‘nudge’, <strong>Richard Thaler</strong>, in his insightful conversation on the main stage with <strong>Cade Massey</strong>. Thaler added that in his view most companies are still not paying as much attention to people analytics as they should be. It’s hard to disagree in spite of the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">significant growth in the adoption of people analytics</a> in the last 18 months – and despite <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6517660308696371200/"" target=""_blank"">research showing that people analytics is the one skill most HR professionals want to learn in 2019</a>. The HR profession needs to change. It needs to embrace digital and become more analytical to deliver greater business value. As <strong>Geoff Garrett</strong>, Dean of the Wharton School, remarked “<em>organisations flourish when people within them flourish</em>.” People analytics and science can help.</p>, <p><em>Richard Thaler in discussion with Cade Massey</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>How can you drive change in a complex organisation? The science of the ‘nudge’ as popularised by Thaler outlines how a series of small incremental changes can deliver significant and substantial business results. Thaler’s interview with Massey provided several insights into how to use nudges wisely. These included:</p>, <p>Any doubts about the impact small changes can have was dispelled when six-times Olympic gold medal winner <strong>Allyson Felix</strong> explained to <strong>Daniel Pink</strong> (who gave an impeccable example of how to conduct an interview) some of the minor improvements she made to her training regime having won silver at both the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games. The marginal gains Felix made helped her finally win gold in the 200 metres at the 2012 Olympics in London.</p>, <p>There was more on nudges throughout the two days. <strong>Kelly Monahan</strong> of Accenture (who together with Kimberly Fazio was the winner of the White Paper Competition), described how nudges played a significant part in successfully shifting technical managers at a professional services company towards providing a greater emphasis on coaching. We also heard from <strong>Stephanie Tignor</strong> on how <a href=""https://humu.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humu</a> has built nudging into its employee engagement technology. I’ve seen similar functionality from the likes of <a href=""https://peakon.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peakon</a> and <a href=""https://www.cultureamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Culture Amp</a> to name but two other providers. Together, technologies like these are helping people analytics teams and their organisations effect behavioural change when it comes to engagement and culture.</p>, <p><em>Images from Wharton PAC 19: (L to R) Daniel Pink interviews Allyson Felix, Stephanie Tignor of Humu and Kelly Monahan, the winner of the White Paper Competition, of Accenture</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>From a personal point of view, I was delighted to see <strong>Manish Goel</strong> on the main stage at Wharton PAC. I’ve been a board advisor at <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> for a year and known Manish and the team since 2016. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">The market for Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) – both the active and passive variations – is heating up</a> and is now being actively used by a growing number of organisations to help generate business value and improve wellbeing in the workplace. <strong>RJ Milnor</strong> provided a compelling example of the power of network analytics through his use of TrustSphere at McKesson. The insights that the analysis highlighted included: i) high performing sales teams build stronger and more balanced internal and external networks, ii) top sales representatives and sales managers form different network profiles from their peers, and iii) HiPOs develop stronger and more balanced networks than their peers. Together these insights have helped McKesson understand better the networking habits that help drives high performance in sales teams and managers.</p>, <p><em>RJ Milnor (McKesson) and Manish Goel (TrustSphere) on how insights from ONA helps drive business results</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Diversity and perhaps more importantly inclusion were prominent themes throughout the conference. We all know (or should know) that the case for D&amp;I is compelling – not just because it is the right thing to do, but because numerous studies suggest it can drive better business performance too. People analytics provides the means to highlight improvements that can be made in our companies and also prove the value. Examples over the two days included:</p>, <p><em>Images from Wharton PAC 19: (L to R): Stephanie Lampkin (Blendoor), Shuba Gopal and Andy Porter (Broad Institute) and Cathy Engelbert (CEO, Deloitte) in conversation with Angela Duckworth</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Following on from <a href=""https://wpa.wharton.upenn.edu/content/video/wharton-people-analytics-conference-2018-keynote-presentation-dj-patil-charles-duhigg/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">last year’s fascinating discussion between DJ Patil and Charles Duhigg</a>, which featured the topic prominently, came a panel on the ethics of people analytics chaired by <strong>Lyle Unger</strong> and featuring <strong>Arvind Narayanan</strong> and <strong>Meg Mitchell</strong> of Google. With the adoption of people analytics continuing to grow, the amount of data rising exponentially and emerging sources of data making what we analyse much broader, ethics will continue to be at the forefront of concerns about the extent to which we use data to make people decisions. What’s at stake if we get it wrong could be the future of the whole field itself.</p>, <p><strong>Adam Grant</strong> put this into context in his closing remarks when he described his biggest fear about the field. I’m sure he spoke for many in the audience by raising his concerns about how far some analytics is moving ahead of science particularly in the field of hiring and selection. Grant had some pretty strong words here emphasising that vendors need to first validate that these tools reliably predict performance, and that failure to do was not only scientifically irresponsible but immoral too. It will be interesting to see if any vendors take up Grant’s challenge of open sourcing their data so it can be subject to review.</p>, <p>Back to the panel. Unger, Narayanan and Mitchell had plenty of words of wisdom around the wise and ethical use of people analytics. These included:</p>, <p>For more on the wise and ethical use of people analytics, please refer to my <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2019/3/22/how-to-create-a-people-analytics-function-for-good"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">recent collaboration with Dawn Klinghoffer</a> (who leads People Analytics at Microsoft).</p>, <p><em>Adam Grant gives his closing remarks at Wharton PAC 19</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>Cathy Engelbert</strong> also provided a powerful insight of what it means to be a leader in the digital age. The rise of employee activism means that leaders need to be more transparent, authentic and responsive. Engelbert gave an example where an employee group went to the New York Times in an effort to force Deloitte to stop working with one US Government Agency. This meant that not only did Engelbert and her team need to work through the night to prepare a communication to employees before the New York Times sought comment, but that they also knew that they would have to provide a copy of the email to the newspaper. Engelbert added that one of the hardest challenges for leaders is striking the balance on when is the right time to add your voice, explaining that if you use it too often your impact will be diminished.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>Marcus Buckingham</strong> had some pretty candid observations about how organisations are (incorrectly in his opinion) measuring performance, leadership effectiveness and potential. In what proved an enjoyable tête-à-tête with Adam Grant, Buckingham eschewed many of the programs that are commonplace in our organisations. On potential, Buckingham observed that the way we select HiPOs has “<em>created a form of apartheid within our companies.</em>” On ratings, Buckingham stressed that these are more a measure of the rater than the ratee, citing studies that shows that the rating from the previous year strongly correlates with the rating an employee will be given the following year. On feedback, Buckingham emphasised his view that the belief people want feedback is actually a lie. Instead, Buckingham believes the focus should instead be on cultivating people’s strengths rather than focusing on their weaknesses. When the Wharton team get around to releasing the videos of the sessions from the event, I highly recommend watching Buckingham’s and Grant’s conversation so you can make up your own mind. For now, have a read of Buckingham’s recent HBR article penned with Ashley Goodall <a href=""https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘The Feedback Fallacy.’</a></p>, <p><a href=""https://hbr.org/2015/04/reinventing-performance-management"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Buckingham worked with Deloitte to help overhaul their performance reviews</a>, so there was a nice segue way to<strong> Cathy Engelbert</strong>'s session where she outlined why Deloitte had replaced its ratings-based performance management system. The move was controversial especially as the change applied to partners as well as employees. In explaining the transition to a feedback-based model, Engelbert revealed that she believes potential is as important, if not more so, than performance. </p>, <p><em>Adam Grant and Marcus Buckingham during their absorbing tête-à-tête</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the distinguishing features of Wharton PAC from other people analytics conferences I’ve attended is the the amount of learning from outside of the field. As well as speakers like Allyson Felix, Richard Thaler and Cathy Englebert, this extended to other areas where we can learn from and apply to the field of people analytics:</p>, <p><em>Images from Wharton PAC 19 (L to R): Rita Singh, Sebastian Wernicke and Ayreann Luedders</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In a departure from his usual approach to closing the conference, <strong>Adam Grant</strong> answered questions posed from the audience. The question from Jennifer Kurkoski (<em>“What concerns you most about the growth in the field?”</em>) has already been covered earlier under ‘Ethics…’ Inspired by Allyson Felix describing her sense of relief – as opposed to euphoria – when finally winning an Olympic Gold Medal at the third attempts (and echoed by the reaction Richard Thaler said he had on learning he had won the Nobel Prize), Grant also said he’d love to see a study on whether you want the person who loves to win or instead the person who hates to lose. He hypothesised that this likely depends on the task and the person, but a deeper understanding of when you want each motivation could be interesting. I wonder if we’ll see someone presenting on this topic at Wharton PAC in 2020?</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Allyson Felix wasn’t the only gold medallist on stage in Philadelphia. One of my favourite features is the competitions at Wharton PAC as they shine a light on innovation in the field as well as showcasing new talent. For 2019, the number of categories rose to four and the standard was consistently high.</p>, <p>The winners were as follows:</p>, <p>Iceland’s <a href=""http://www.payanalytics.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>PayAnalytics</strong></a> emerged from the pack with founder <strong>Margrét Bjarnadóttir</strong> giving a compelling presentation of her company’s technology that is designed to help customers close the gender pay gap. The four other finalists also warrant a mention: <a href=""https://www.organizationview.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Organization View</a> (see <strong>Andrew Marritt</strong>’s <a href=""https://www.organizationview.com/insights-articles/2019/4/7/wharton-people-analytics-presentation"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">outline of his presentation here</a>), <a href=""https://www.worklytics.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Worklytics</a>, <a href=""https://orgmapper.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">OrgMapper</a> and <a href=""https://www.atipicainc.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Atipica</a>.</p>, <p><em>Images from Wharton PAC 19 (L to R): Winner of the start up competition Margrét Bjarnadóttir (PayAnalytics) with runners-up Andrew Marritt (Organization View) and Philip Arkcoll (Worklytics)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The inaugural edition of this competition proved particularly popular with the people analytics leaders I spoke to as it featured real case studies practitioners had undertaken within their organisations. <strong>Kelly Monahan</strong> (Accenture) gave a terrific presentation on the use of behavioural science to help technical managers pivot towards coaching to take away the spoils. I enjoyed each of the other four finalists too: GM (<strong>Michael Arena</strong> and <strong>Nathaniel Bulkley</strong>) on using network analysis to enable adaptive space, IBM (<strong>Brian Johnston</strong>, <strong>Jonathan DeBusk</strong> and <strong>Pankaj Srivastava</strong>) on using machine learning to support reskilling, Uber (<strong>Schinria Islam</strong> and <strong>Dan Willard</strong>) on workplace inclusion, and Microsoft (<strong>Ankit Tandon</strong> and <strong>Spencer Buja</strong>) on understanding and measuring the productivity of software developers.</p>, <p><em>Images from Wharton PAC 19 (L to R): Winner of the White Paper Competition Kelly Monahan (Accenture) with fellow finalists Brian Johnston (IBM) and Michael Arena (GM)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The winner here saw a fascinating study by <strong>Roman Galperin</strong> and <strong>H. Colleen Stuart</strong> into the gender bias that exists even in expert-based roles such as patent examination. Two findings in their research were i) female patent experts take an average of two months longer than their male counterparts to get to a specific grade, ii) decisions by female experts are less likely to be accepted.</p>, <p>This competition saw student teams compete to submit analyses and recommendations for the Nurse-Family Partnership, with the winners coming from the University of Pennsylvania. Congratulations to <strong>Connor Joyce</strong>, <strong>Eric Lyons</strong> and <strong>Amarachi Nasa-Okolie</strong>. I’m sure a successful career in people analytics awaits each of them.</p>, <p><em>Images from Wharton PAC 19 (L to R): Roman Galperin, winner of the Research Paper Competition (with H. Colleen Stuart) and Connor Joyce, Eric Lyons and Amarechi Nasa-Okolie from the University of Pennsylvania - the winners of the Case Competition. </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As well as <strong>Lindsey Vonn</strong>, who is slated to speak at Wharton PAC next year, one other thing we can look forward to in 2020 is research on what it takes to run a successful and thriving people analytics team. <strong>Laura Zarrow</strong> announced that the Wharton team was taking this on as a research question and I for one will be eager to see the results, not least to see how this shapes up in comparison to the <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/8/9/nine-dimensions-for-excellence-in-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics Model</em></strong></a>, I launched last year with Jonathan Ferrar.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A huge congratulations again to the Wharton People Analytics team, particularly the students who did much of the organising of the conference and the creation of the program. Hats off to conference chair <strong>Tyler Caldwell</strong> and the team.</p>, <p>Summarising the key takeaways from a conference so rich and diverse in content is a real challenge, and I hope I have done Wharton PAC justice here. The only way to enjoy the full experience is to actually go to the conference in person, and I strongly recommend that everyone working in or interested in people analytics should try and get along to Wharton PAC at least once in their careers. <a href=""https://wpa.wharton.upenn.edu/conference/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Next year’s conference is on 2-3 April 2020</a>.</p>, <p>Finally, the best conferences put networking at the front and centre of proceedings, and this is something at which Wharton PAC excels – as Cade Massey commented it is a team sport to advance analytics. Unfortunately, my memory isn’t quite what it was so apologies in advance for not mentioning everyone, but other than those already mentioned I particularly enjoyed talking to: Sally Smith, Andrew Marritt, Lu Chang, Angela Crossman, Courtney McMahon, Nigel Guenole, Sheri Feinzig, Geetanjali Gamel, Phil Chambers, Caroline Pennartz, John Pernsteiner, Greg Newman, Rebecca White, Don Gray, Alex Currit, Michael Arena, Priya Bagga, Philip Arkcoll, Annabel Koh, Arun Sundar, Brad Hubbard, Arun Chidambaram, Sebastian Munoz, Scott Parrigon, Jeffrey Lee, Karyn Marciniak, Justine Harmant, Tyler Orr, Chongro Lee, Lei Pan, Ray Yang, Dirk Petersen, Dafna Aaronson, Olga Antonova and Meghan Anzelc.</p>, <p><em>The organisers of Wharton PAC 19 - mainly students - gathered on stage at the culmination of the conference (Pic courtesy of Chris Lyons, Worklytics)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The conference always inspires a number of blogs and articles and add these as they appear here:</p>, <p>I’ll be chairing and/or speaking about people analytics, data-driven HR and the <em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</em> model at the following events until the end of October 2019. </p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>David is a globally respected writer, speaker, conference chair, and executive consultant on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

David R. Green,"April 4, 2019",The best HR and People Analytics articles of March 2019,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-march-2019-david-green/,"[<p>March was a phenomenally busy yet rewarding month. It started with a meeting of members of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6512347460072017921/"" target=""_blank"">Insight222’s People Analytics Program at Swarovski’s HQ in Zürich</a>. Next it was <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6514177783709597698/"" target=""_blank"">a rambunctious UNLEASH</a> show in London (<a href=""https://www.slideshare.net/DavidGreen21/how-to-create-more-impact-with-people-analytics"" target=""_blank"">download my slides here</a>) before I headed off to Barcelona to speak at and chair the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6516209569344163840/"" target=""_blank"">Leading with Talent Analytics</a> conference. This week, I’ve hosted a TrustSphere and Culture Amp event on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6519155209422413824/"" target=""_blank"">Moving towards Data-Driven D&amp;I</a> in New York and will end my travels in Philadelphia for the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6518092204496556032/"" target=""_blank"">Wharton People Analytics Conference</a>.</p>, <p>What is abundantly clear from all of these events is that people analytics continues to grow and thrive. Data has emerged as a core foundation of all parts of HR – from recruiting to performance management, from efforts to design and improve the employee experience to programs focused on diversity and inclusion. The rise in use of organisational network analysis (ONA) continues and the focus of the community to ensure that people data is used for good remains.</p>, <p>Whilst trying to escape Brexit and the increasing ineptitude of the British political class, I’ve found plenty of solace in a vintage collection of articles this month. I hope you enjoy learning from them as much as I did.</p>, <p>Look out also at the end for news of the <a href=""https://pafow.com/london19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work conference in London on 24-25 April</a>, but without further ado let’s get into the articles I’ve selected for March:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There’s certainly not a shortage of ideas when it comes to people analytics, but as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> highlights in his excellent article, it can all be a bit overwhelming at times. Instead, in order to ensure analytics provides sustainable impact, Ulrich advocates organising these ideas into three relatively simple questions: How? (“analytics that matter and that improves decision making”), What? (“analytics that link to business outcomes”), and How? “making analytics actionable”). If that wasn’t enough, Ulrich also provides an assessment enabling users to conduct analysis on their own analytics (see <strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong><em>: Self-assessment of People Analytics efforts (Source: Dave Ulrich)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The Human Resources profession needs to change. It must become more digital and analytical to deliver greater business value – and as the findings of our recently published <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/skills-report"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Skills of the Future</a> study reveal, this is recognised by HR professionals themselves too. As <strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong> shows, 28% of respondents said People Analytics was the one skill they’d like to develop most in 2019. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> highlights some of the key findings in his analysis of the report covering the Skills of the Future as well as the Future of Learning. <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/skills-report"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The full report is available to download</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: </em></strong><em>People analytics is the number one skill that HR professionals want to develop (Source: myHRfuture, 2019 HR Skills of the Future)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> shares his latest thinking on some of the key methodologies for ‘Employee Experience’ (“design thinking, moments that matter, workforce segmentation, process harmonisation”), and the growing plethora of technology tools to help diagnose and improve employee experience. He goes on to provide a number of recommendations such as the need to pay special attention to onboarding, creating personas and engaging the people analytics team. Bersin has long spoken about creating the ‘irresistible organisation’ (see <strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong>), and implies heavily here that employee experience holds the key.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong><em>: The Irresistible Organisation – A complete Employee Experience (Source: Josh Bersin)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It’s become increasingly obvious that the business value of traditional performance management models has disintegrated. In this excellent MIT/McKinsey study on rethinking the field we learn how the future of performance management is more data-driven, more flexible, more continuous, more development-oriented and shifting towards teams. Features insights from a plethora of CHROs including Donna Morris (Adobe), Diane Gherson (IBM) and Dean Carter (Patagonia) as well as the likes of Peter Cappelli, Ben Waber and Anna Tavis.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A brilliant article from Deloitte, which outlines that against a climate of 90% of companies exploring organisational design, how ONA can help leaders understand the formal and informal networks in their company, and consequently provide insights that result in more successful organisational redesign and business performance. The immense promise of ONA is captured perfectly by the authors when they liken adding ONA to other organisational design indicators, to adding MRIs and brain scan capabilities to the humble x-ray. For more on ONA, please see my article: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">The role of ONA in People Analytics</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: </em></strong><em>Current and desired collaboration networks within the same part of an organisation as reported by employees (Source: Deloitte)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I was fortunate to catch-up recently with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, Head of People Analytics at Microsoft, to collaborate on an article that examines the role of employee trust in creating and sustaining an advanced people analytics function. As well as explaining her three core pillars of trust, Dawn provides an example of a people analytics/ONA project at Microsoft (see <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>) that provided demonstrable value to employees. The interview was inspired by Dawn’s recent speech at PAFOW in San Francisco.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>A manager’s email behaviour is related to their directs’ perceptions of work/life balance (Source: Dawn Klinghoffer)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this insightful study, IBM’s Smarter Workforce Institute team examine the nature of diversity and inclusion, explore biases as an inhibitor to more diverse and inclusive workplaces, and provide insights into the role that AI can play in mitigating biases. There are several interesting insights including <strong><em>FIG 6</em></strong> below, which highlights that over 20% of HR professionals are concerned that AI could perpetuate or worsen bias. Practical recommendations – including the need to use the right data and the right algorithms - are also offered to organisations looking to adopt AI in their HR practices.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 6</em></strong>: One in five HR professionals are concerned that AI could perpetuate or increase biases (Source: IBM and UNLEASH Professional HR Study, 2018)</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A pair of terrific articles on diversity and inclusion. In the first, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drtomaschamorro/"" target=""_blank"">Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic</a> (in a sneak preview of his new book, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Why-Many-Incompetent-Become-Leaders/dp/1633696324"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Why do so many incompetent men become leaders?</a>) discusses the need to stop associating leadership with masculine features in order to truly remove bias between the genders. The second article examines the impact of a lack of inclusion on individual employees, especially when they are a minority, and argues to put an end to costly workplace isolation (see <strong><em>FIG 7</em></strong>) experienced by many women, they should be clustered on teams and also improve the promotion process.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 7: </em></strong><em>LeanIn.Org and McKinsey Women in the Workplace study</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cade-massey-8036282/"" target=""_blank"">Cade Massey</a> writes “<em>in the messy real world of ambiguous evidence and contentious objectives, organizational decisions — especially those about the people you’re hiring, developing, managing, and trying to retain — usually hinge on relationships and trust</em>.” This means that black boxes should probably be avoided and instead if you work in people analytics, you must learn to deal in the currency of trust to make an impact. It’s not enough to be right. You also have to sell your model or idea. An excellent and thoughtful piece.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’m not sure how I missed this fabulous article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanpettman/"" target=""_blank"">Jordan Pettman</a> the first time around, but it’s time to redress the situation. Jordan, who is Global Head of People Analytics at Nestlé tackles the need to balance demand for reporting whilst ensuring that people analytics can realise its full promise. Jordan recommends a blend of harnessing technology to automate reporting together with a drive to help HR business partners improve their data literacy. All this is designed to give people analytics teams the time and space they need to increase their impact within the business.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A common mistake in people analytics is focussing on easily-accessible data, not the right data. In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> writes on how to combine qualitative and quantitative data to create better models and therefore make better decisions.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A terrific collection of the types of insights that can be generated through people analytics, with nine examples covering areas such as leadership, recruiting, diversity and network analytics from a series of organisations – large and small as well as from the public sector. Features commentary from a host of practitioners including Olly Britnell (Experian), Greig Aitken (RBS), Andrea Owen (Office of National Statistics) and Toby Culshaw (Philips).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Having a CHRO that sets the agenda for a data-driven approach is a critical element in creating impact, value and sustainable capability in people analytics. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarina-berg-5375074/"" target=""_blank"">Katarina Berg</a> is one such CHRO and her article describes the approach to people analytics at Spotify, which is composed of three distinct buckets related to i) process transformation, ii) cultural transformation and iii) top-down strategic transformation.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Some great analysis here from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Garr</a>, who having reviewed over 30 published articles and academic papers (some of which she highlights), summarises the key trends in the space including: growth and maturity, a focus on the employee, collaboration and ethics, as well as some of the gaps.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> writes here, building a great analytics function isn’t just about having the right people. Having access to the right technology is crucial to getting the most out of your team. Keith’s article then goes on to describe a multitude of technologies across four areas: collaboration (e.g. Slack and Circuit), agile management (e.g. Trello), document and app sharing (e.g. R and Python), and version control (e.g. GitHub).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjcook/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Cook</a> cuts through the hype associated with wearables, providing a powerful example of how Bank of America used wearable technology to identify that their call-centre employees with the fastest average call handling team were also their most social. The ensuing program the bank put in place generated a $15m uplift in annual productivity. Ian also provides a handy six-step process to unlocking the benefits of wearable data.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the most powerful examples of ONA is how GM used it to stimulate innovation and effectively disrupt themselves from the inside. The case study and the academic research behind it is documented in this wonderful MIT Sloan Management Review article. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">For more great articles on ONA, there is a list here.</a></p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8: </em></strong><em>Adaptive space is the network and organisational context that allows people, ideas, information, and resources to flow across the organisation and spur successful emergent innovation (Source: MIT SMR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of my favourite books of the past year is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amedmondson/"" target=""_blank"">Amy Edmondson</a>’s <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Organization-Psychological-Workplace-Innovation/dp/1119477247"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Fearless Organization</a>, so this episode of Let’s Fix Work is certainly worth a listen as Amy joins host <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurieruettimann/"" target=""_blank"">Laurie Reuttimann</a> to talk psychological safety, inviting participation, and creating a productive workplace of tomorrow.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Along with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/yvettecameron/"" target=""_blank"">Yvette Cameron</a>, who is also leading some ground-breaking work in this space, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Spence</a> has become my go-to when it comes to understanding the role Blockchain will play in the future of work and the HR function. In this speech from the recent People Matters TechHR show in Singapore, Andy provides four examples of how Blockchain is already being used in HR, sprinkles in a dose of James Bond as well as taking the opportunity to impart plenty of dry Mancunian humour.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arun-sundar-2290237/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Sundar</a> and I together with several senior HR leaders in Asia-Pacific examine how “Social Capital” can be leveraged to enhance collaboration within organisations and consequently drive improvements in business performance and team cohesion as well as a better employee experience. The article covers applications of passive ONA and is the third-part of a series of articles focusing on people analytics in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In my preview of the Wharton People Analytics Conference, I reflect on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a>’s closing remarks from last year’s conference. Grant outlined three challenges for the people analytics community to think about: (i) bringing your data to life to challenge intuition, (ii) researching the importance of sequencing, and (iii) studying the effect of our behaviour on others.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A few weeks back, I had the honour of being MC of the inaugural SHRM Tech EMEA conference in Dubai. This article summarises my key takeaways from the event with insights from the likes of Mark Levy, Jason Averbook, Anna Tavis and Rana Askoul, topics ranging from Employee Experience, HR Technology, the Future of Work and People Analytics and how this is shaping the future of HR.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I also spoke on the Influencers stage at UNLEASH in London recently on how to create more impact with people analytics. The <a href=""https://www.slideshare.net/DavidGreen21/how-to-create-more-impact-with-people-analytics"" target=""_blank"">deck is available to download on Slideshare</a> and includes data illustrating the rapid growth in adoption of people analytics, the Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics model I co-created with Jonathan Ferrar and a number of case studies highlighting how organisations have used people analytics to drive business outcomes and improve employee experience.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I had the pleasure of being a guest on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/walkeralan/"" target=""_blank"">Alan Walker</a>’s excellent Chat Talent webinar where I talked about the rise of people analytics, walked through some cases studies and presented highlights of the aforementioned <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/skills-report"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Skills of the Future</a> report.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Mercifully, April will be a quieter month than March and when I return from the Wharton People Analytics Conference in Philadelphia at the end of the week, I won’t be leaving the UK for the rest of the month – although with all the shenanigans about Brexit maybe that isn’t such a good thing after all.

Green,"March 4, 2019",The best HR and People Analytics articles of February 2019,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-february-2019-david-green/,"[<p>It may be the most diminutive month, but there certainly wasn’t a dearth of people analytics and data-driven HR themed articles in February. Indeed, whittling down the articles to the final list this month has proved an intensely gruelling task.</p>, <p>February started for me in San Francisco with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/four-strategic-imperatives-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">the biggest and most successful People Analytics &amp; Future of Work Conference yet</a>, which I co-chaired with Al Adamsen. Next stop was Birmingham for the <a href=""https://www.hrdsummit.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRD Summit</a>, where I spoke and also co-ran a workshop with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> on our <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/8/9/nine-dimensions-for-excellence-in-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics model</a>.</p>, <p>Finally, I’ve just returned from Dubai, where I chaired <a href=""https://www.shrmtech.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the inaugural SHRM Tech EMEA conference</a> – the personal highlight being the panel on the future of work I moderated with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/denaalmansoori/"" target=""_blank"">Dena Almansoori</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-levy-b695201/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Levy</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonaverbook/"" target=""_blank"">Jason Averbook</a>.</p>, <p>Gauging <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHtTJ7aBjTc"" target=""_blank"">the sound of the crowd</a> from all three shows was the recognition that HR simply has to evolve. Where data is concerned, this means embracing people analytics to help enable better business decisions, drive improvements to the workforce experience and consequently increase HR’s own impact. The articles selected this month are all designed to help support this theme.</p>, <p>  </p>, <p>Just as <a href=""https://www.organizationview.com/insights-articles/2018/5/25/sometimes-the-best-solutions-arent-the-most-sophisticated"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">people analytics doesn’t need to be sophisticated to unlock value</a>, nor do findings necessarily need to be a great leap forward to be useful. Indeed, as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> writes in this excellent piece for MIT SMR, quantifying obvious insights through people analytics can help gain trust and overcome three obstacles to change. These are: resistance to data (“But that’s not what my experience has shown”), resistance to change (“But that’s the way we’ve always done it”) and organisational uniqueness bias (“That will never work here”).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article, which previews his white paper collaboration with ServiceNow of the same name, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> describes the emergence of the Employee Experience Platform (EXP). He defines an EXP as a user-centric software layer that gives workers a single point of access for a range of services, thus shielding them from heterogeneous back-end systems. When implemented well, Josh suggests that the EXP platform should also enable AI, nudges, mobile apps, and cognitive interfaces to help drive personalisation, productivity and engagement.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: </em></strong><em>Employee journeys cross functional areas and systems (Source: Josh Bersin)</em> </p>, <p>  </p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> builds on Josh’s article, some of the other latest thinking on Employee Experience and his own experience designing EX programs at Cisco, advocating that HR should aim higher than just service-based excellence and efficiency. Instead, Ian implores HR to design people-centric platforms that create a great experience for the entire workforce (not just employees) that they actually want to use. In what is truly a coruscating piece, Ian also urges that <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/the-business-value-of-ex-no-employee-experience-impact-without-the-business"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">EX initiatives need to be linked to business value</a> as well as being focused on fixing the key touch points that matter in the employee journey. Finally, Ian tackles the thorny issue of data ownership, concluding that HR should lead the charge for workers to own their own data, so they can take it with them when they leave and build intrinsic value for managing their careers and promote lifelong employability.</p>, <p>Set a challenge by ING CHRO, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hein-knaapen-a879289/"" target=""_blank"">Hein Knaapen</a>, to explain the business value of Employee Experience (EX), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> pulls it off with aplomb in this terrific article. The model he describes (see <strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong>), shows the ‘What’ of <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TI-people</a>’s EX methodology on the right-hand side, which he connects to business value in the ‘Why’ part of the model. The two features Volker highlights is how the approach creates i) an engaging experience at ‘moments of truth’, and ii) an effortless experience of HR. He goes on to reveal that one company TI-people is working with has designed their EX initiative around the premise of “<em>Giving 1 million hours back to employees and managers each year</em>”. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: </em></strong><em>The business value of Employee Experience (Source: Volker Jacobs, TI-people)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Giving people their own data to help them learn and develop is one of the conclusions drawn from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebrebele/"" target=""_blank"">Reb Rebele</a>’s excellent analysis on the pros and cons of psychometric tests. Reb describes why personality testing and other ways of analysing potential present significant challenges. He explains that not all assessments pass the sniff test, and people’s personalities vary from moment to moment, often depending on the challenge at hand. Instead, Reb argues, we need a finer-grained understanding of human potential including a better consideration of context and measures designed with variability in mind. Reb’s and Adam Grant’s articles are both taken from a <a href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/columns/mit-smr-series-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">MIT SMR series on People Analytics</a>. Check out the other articles by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-duckworth-1289/"" target=""_blank"">Angela Duckworth</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-bidwell-4950061/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Bidwell</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/federica-de-stefano-1962b629/"" target=""_blank"">Federica De Stefano</a> too.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenporttom/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Davenport</a> has been referred to as ‘the father of analytics’, so when he writes that HR’s use of advanced analytics is 14% higher than in Finance (see <strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong>), one sits up and takes notice. Tom’s article, <a href=""https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/hr-analytics-report-ipaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">based on research he conducted in unison with Oracle</a>, goes further in presenting evidence that HR is not just employing analytics but also AI in significant and growing numbers. The research uncovered that just over half of HR organisations in the global survey now say they can perform advanced (predictive and prescriptive) analytics, with only 6% of HR respondents admitting they are “novices” at analytics. Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that 31% made AI the first choice of analytics they are using. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: </em></strong><em>Comparison of HR vs. Finance on analytical methodologies used (Source: Oracle - HR Moves Boldly into Advanced Analytics with Collaboration from Finance)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This in-depth case study describes in detail how IBM reimagined its performance management system (see <strong><em>FIG 4</em></strong>) by co-creating a model with employees that promoted speed, innovation, promoted feedback over assessment and strove to cultivate a high-performance culture. Insights are offered throughout by IBM’s CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-gherson-1b93b77/"" target=""_blank"">Diane Gherson</a> and VP Global Talent <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanna-daly-035b741/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Daly</a> with supporting commentary from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annatavis/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Tavis</a>. The MIT SMR article also describes how IBM overhauled and personalised learning to reflect that “<em>in today’s world, skills are actually more important than jobs.</em>” This platform uses data to infer which skills employees have and connects them with learning to build those skills that are increasingly in demand. If that wasn’t enough, the case study also outlines how IBM uses people analytics to predict and prevent attrition, as well as how the company has deployed chatbots and virtual assistants to improve the employee experience. A must-read.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: </em></strong><em>﻿The shift in IBM's approach to performance management (Source: MIT SMR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> cuts through the hype and distils what the digital revolution means for HR. He describes a four phased approach to evolve HR into a digital function. These are: i) Efficiency “using technology to streamline administrative and repetitive work”, ii) Innovation (see <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>) “using technology and apps to innovate HR practice”, iii) Information “using technology, data and analytics to support better decision making”, and; iv) Connection “using technology to create connections and enhance the employee experience to drive individual and organisational productivity.”</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>Examples of how HR can improve HR practices with technology applications (Source: Dave Ulrich)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As highlighted earlier, <a href=""https://pafow.com/pafow19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the PAFOW conference in San Francisco</a> was the biggest and most successful yet in the show’s thirteen-year history, as this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qbYmVj0Q0w"" target=""_blank"">highlights video shows</a>. Over the two days, some of the crème de la crème of the people analytics cognoscenti spoke, which meant I was able to create and organise my key takeaways around <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/four-strategic-imperatives-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">a manifesto of four strategic imperatives</a> for the field. The article features insights from the likes of: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bahubbard/"" target=""_blank"">Brad Hubbard</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-whiteman-ph-d-02a8097/"" target=""_blank"">Heather Whiteman</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/misael-cerpas-05972686/"" target=""_blank"">Misael Cerpas</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwhite612/"" target=""_blank"">David White</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyushmathur/"" target=""_blank"">Piyush Mathur</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-higgins-5875082/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Higgins</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardrosenow/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Rosenow</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Garr</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/manishgoelts/"" target=""_blank"">Manish Goel</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a>. It all augers well for <a href=""https://pafow.com/london19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW London on 24/25 April</a> and <a href=""https://pafow.com/philadelphia19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW Philadelphia on 11/12 September</a>. See you there!</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 6</em></strong><em>: Four Strategic Imperatives for People Analytics (Source: David Green)</em></p>, <p>I am often asked how to set up and focus people analytics in a small to medium enterprise, and it is true that the vast majority of case studies, articles conference speeches and research focuses on people analytics in large organisations. However, if you look carefully enough there are a several examples of smaller companies having significant success with people analytics. In this revealing piece, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/littal-shemer-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Littal Shemer Haim</a> interviews <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-shoval-ab05b93/"" target=""_blank"">Michal Shoval</a> on her journey at GIA - 'the motives, the obstacles, the quick win, the team participation, and more'.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Three must-read articles for those leading or working in people analytics teams. First the inimitable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> walks through the first question one should ask before building a model – namely is it intended to be explanatory (""created to help understand why something is happening"") or predictive (""created to make predictions as accurately as possible regarding what will happen""). The second article looks at the critical role of translators in analytics, providing guidance on hiring and developing translators, imbuing translator skills into the wider employee population and growing organisational ability to deliver analytics use cases. The third article, whilst focused on marketing, also highlights the need for a translator as well as seven other steps to take when conducting an experiment. As the authors state, experimentation promises the power of the scientific method to help reduce uncertainty.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Learning to navigate and manage the intense rise of collaborative demands in today’s workplace is, as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> writes in his article, a skill that is necessary to survive and thrive in today’s world. Rob’s article then describes seven habits of highly inefficient collaborators including ‘time vampires’, ‘black holes’, ‘calendar killers’ and ‘fear creators.’ <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjcook/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Cook</a> draws on further research from Rob in his article examining the business impact of collaborative overload such as burnout and ‘turnover contagion.’ Ian then explains how ONA can be deployed in conjunction with people analytics to reduce the risk of burnout by identifying influencers, uncovering turnover trends and quantifying the cost of the problem.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the emerging use cases for ONA is in measuring the effectiveness of diversity and inclusion initiatives through a social capital lens. This is the focus of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a>’s terrific article. Citing research from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/boris-groysberg-31a93a5/"" target=""_blank"">Boris Groysberg</a>, Greg describes how female and male employees tend to build stronger external and internal networks respectively and the impact this has when they move job. Greg also provides insights from some of <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a>’s clients on how networks can affect promotability, trust and collaboration. One example (see <strong><em>FIG 7</em></strong>) includes an organisation where if an employee had more than ten years tenure, they had virtually no strong working relationships with anyone with less than five years tenure. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the negative impact this will likely have on innovation, problem-solving and ultimately business performance.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 7: </em></strong><em>Example of ONA analysis showing the strongest relationships of employees with 10+ years tenure at one company (Source: TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-january-2019-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Last month’s collection</a> featured a landmark study by Accenture on <a href=""https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/future-workforce/workforce-data-organizational-dna"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">trust, data and unlocking value in the digital workplace</a>. This article looks at how companies can use workplace data in an effective, responsible, and ethical way. The authors present a framework of three key actions responsible leaders can take: i) Give employees more control, ii) Create a system of checks and balances, iii) Use Data to Elevate People, Not Penalise Them. Examples from the likes of Schlumberger, JP Morgan Chase and AXA are provided respectively to highlight each step of the framework. Interestingly and similar to the earlier articles by Ian Bailie and Reb Rebele, the study advocates that people data should be co-owned with employees so they can take it with them when they move jobs.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As technology and workforce expectations evolve along with the shift from roles to skills, lifelong learning has become the expected norm. This has moved the goalposts with regards to learning and development and has prompted a revolution in the space in the shape of the increased use of data, analytics and personalisation. These three articles collectively provide a comprehensive view of this shift. <a href=""http://Josh%20Bersin"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marczs/"" target=""_blank"">Marc-Zao Sanders</a> describe a new paradigm of ‘learning in the flow of work.’ The second article from McKinsey describe ‘lifelong employability’ and how this allows companies to get ahead of the skills challenge while in parallel making a better workplace for everyone. Finally, the Deloitte article provides an excellent primer on the what, why and how of learning analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulvanderlaken/"" target=""_blank"">Paul van der Laken</a> may well have produced with this list the best curation of books for the forward-thinking data-driven (or data-curious) HR professional in existence. Indeed, it almost deserves a Nobel Prize. Paul was inspired by a post by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredvaldron/"" target=""_blank"">Jared Valdron</a>’s call for book recommendations on people analytics on LinkedIn, which drew nearly 60 responses. Paul decided to merge these overviews and voila, the community now has a monumental resource to draw from. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>With the staggering but yet not surprising revelation from the World Economic Forum that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/18/global-gender-pay-gap-will-take-202-years-to-close-says-world-economic-forum"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">it will take 202 years to close the global gender pay gap</a>, it seems entirely appropriate to highlight some of the best D&amp;I themed articles that were published in February. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thestevenhuang/"" target=""_blank"">Steven Huang</a> provides a practical step-by-step guide on how to answer the question: “Is there a systematic bias in how Men vs. Women employees are paid?”. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellentaaffe/"" target=""_blank"">Ellen Taaffe</a> provides a number of tips for firms to turn good intentions around inclusion into actions – including studying the data. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisarabasca/"" target=""_blank"">Lisa Rabasca Roepe</a> describes how the difference in how men and women approach networking has a big impact on career opportunities, and outlines six ways how women can better leverage their connections. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/glencathey/"" target=""_blank"">Glen Cathey</a>’s lengthy but fascinating piece provides a compelling argument for neuro diversity based on research showing brain-level variances between introverts and extroverts that result in real differences in how they think, process information, interact with others, and work best. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Garr</a> outlines the updated RedThread Research and Mercer study into the growth of HR technology companies that service the diversity and inclusion field.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8: </em></strong><em>Problems D&amp;I technology is trying to solve (Source: Red Thread Research and Mercer)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Originally published in 2015, where it featured in my collection of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21-best-hr-analytics-articles-2015-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">the best people analytics articles of 2015</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a> presents his three ‘laws’ of people/workforce analytics in what continues to be both a popular and prescient article: i) The demand for workforce analytics grows exponentially; ii) The consumption of workforce analytics requires effort; iii) Workforce analytics trumps workforce planning – in most circumstances. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Two podcasts I recommend listening to this month are first <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/beneubanks/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Eubanks</a> in conversation with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Garr</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroleljackson/"" target=""_blank"">Carole Jackson</a> on the aforementioned Red Thread Research and Mercer study into the burgeoning diversity and inclusion technology field. In the second podcast, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> talks to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-sexton-brown-98831b36/"" target=""_blank"">Emily Sexton-Brown</a> about the current trends in HR, just how damaging technology can be and how the field needs to develop our ideas and current mindset for HR to evolve.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> is my go-to on employee listening and text analytics and in this interview with <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">myHRfuture</a>, he offers a number of great insights on the developments taking place in this space. His thoughts on the usefulness (or otherwise) of sentiment analysis are particularly illuminating.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the run up to SHRM Tech EMEA, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanadielsayyed/"" target=""_blank"">Hanadi El Sayyed</a> interviewed me about trends and challenges in the people analytics field.

David R. Green,"February 14, 2019",Four Strategic Imperatives for People Analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/four-strategic-imperatives-people-analytics-david-green/,"[<p>‘<em>People Data for Good</em>’ was the theme of what proved to be the biggest and most successful People Analytics &amp; Future of Work (PAFOW) show yet in San Francisco on 31 January and 1 February.</p>, <p>In terms of blending high-quality speakers, an absorbing program and the most innovative companies from a thriving vendor community with a highly knowledgeable, inquisitive and collaborative audience, PAFOW ranks as the premier people analytics conference on the planet.</p>, <p>The San Francisco show in particular is always one of my personal highlights of the year. So, I am particularly grateful to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> for inviting me into the PAFOW family three years ago to co-chair the tri-series of conferences (San Francisco, Philadelphia and now <a href=""https://pafow.com/london19/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">London on 24/25 April</a>). This was the 13th PAFOW Al has organised in San Francisco. From speaking to the significant number of delegates who have been attending the conference for years, the 2019 edition was undoubtedly the best yet.</p>, <p>Certainly, the presenters and discussions over the two days confirmed to me that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">the rise of people analytics</a> continues unabated. Moreover, what became even clearer from PAFOW was that people analytics continues to shift from an HR to a business focused initiative as the work of the more advanced teams expands into areas such as business strategy, productivity, performance and building the workforce of the future. </p>, <p>The extent to how <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-reasons-why-people-analytics-central-future-hr-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">people analytics has shifted from the periphery to the centre of HR</a> was highlighted when <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Josh Bersin</strong></a> (below with Al and me) opened PAFOW by presenting his research on <a href=""https://joshbersin.com/hr-tech-disruptions-for-2019/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the key HR technology disruptions for 2019</a>. Every prediction outlined by Josh had data and analytics as a core foundation. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As I was due to be the penultimate speaker on day two in San Francisco, I decided to build my presentation on the key themes covered by the speakers on day one of the show. This group of speakers represented some of the leading practitioners in our field. The work they and their teams are undertaking in their respective organisations ably demonstrates what is possible with people analytics.</p>, <p>In presenting some of the key takeaways, I have organised these into a ‘Manifesto for People Analytics’ - four strategic imperatives (see <strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong>) that must be embraced if we are to realise the promise of people analytics.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong><em>: Four Strategic Imperatives for People Analytics (Source: David Green)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>When it comes to connecting with CXO, people analytics teams need to focus their efforts on solving the most pressing business challenges that their organisations face. Start with the business problem rather than with the data. This means that before commencing a project, determining whether it will save the company money, make it more competitive, increase revenue and profit or improve operations. Connecting successfully with the C-Suite also means creating actionable insights, making a compelling case for change and managing stakeholders effectively as well as measuring and quantifying the outcomes of people analytics projects.  Throughout the two days numerous examples of how speakers had connected their people analytics teams and initiatives with their CXO were provided, including:<strong> </strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst people analytics undoubtedly has tremendous potential to make a huge difference to business performance, the opportunity is arguably even larger when it comes to enhancing workforce experience and wellbeing. In my speech I cited Jeffrey Pfeffer’s book ‘<em>Dying for a Paycheck’</em>. Pfeffer provides a damning indictment on how our workplaces are literally killing people and harming both the health of our employees and company performance. With people analytics, we have the opportunity to make workforce experience and wellbeing our North Star and shine a light on the damage the practices cited by Pfeffer cause to organisational performance and individual well-being. In this way, we can help to create better, fairer and more humane workplaces and also in parallel drive improvements to business performance. The overwhelming verdict from PAFOW is that many companies have taken this responsibility on board and are using people analytics to provide value to workers. Examples include: </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>To create sustainable capability in people analytics, it is absolutely vital that the rest of HR – particularly HR Business Partners – embrace a data driven approach to people decisions. Indeed, in Bersin by Deloitte’s landmark <a href=""http://marketing.bersin.com/rs/976-LMP-699/images/Infographic-HIPAN-TopFindings.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">High-Impact People Analytics research</a> from 2017, organisations with advanced maturity in people analytics are three times more likely to have a culture of data-driven decision making. In many respects this is the Holy Grail for our field, and it is certainly the challenge that consistently ranks highest whenever I speak to practitioners and CHROs. Indeed, at <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> we have embarked on a co-creation, as part of <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/the-people-analytics-program"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The People Analytics Program</a>, to support our member organisations in creating more business value through enabling their HRBP/HR communities to be more skilled in scoping, translating and driving action using people data and analytics. The speakers at PAFOW collectively offered a number of suggestions to effect, what is for the majority of organisations, change management. These included: </p>, <p><em>Developing a data-driven culture in HR: Fact-based HR Escape Room at ABN Amro (left), Insight222 Co-Creation Project with member organisations of the People Analytics Program</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As mentioned in the opening line of this article, the overarching theme of PAFOW (in San Francisco as well as in the upcoming shows in <a href=""https://pafow.com/london19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">London on 24/25 April</a> and <a href=""https://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Philadelphia on 11/12 September</a>) is ‘<em>People Data for Good</em>’. The theme was embraced wholeheartedly by speakers, vendors and delegates alike, which perhaps isn’t a surprise given that ethics, privacy and trust is perhaps the most important aspect of people analytics. There is tremendous potential for people analytics. If we get it right, then workers, managers and leaders will enjoy huge benefits. However, if we get it wrong then the whole field of people analytics could be derailed and set back a generation. Fortunately, the two days at PAFOW ably demonstrated that those leading the way in our field are prepared to grasp this responsibility, fiercely protect the sanctity of people data and ensure that our organisations are using people analytics for good. Examples over the two days included:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Achieving all the four ‘imperatives’ of the People Analytics Manifesto can be hard, but the rewards make it worth the effort. As well as providing demonstrable value to the business and the workforce in a wise and ethical way, people analytics teams are able to create sustainable capability through the evolution of a data-driven culture. The levers – or dimensions – to succeed were outlined by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Jonathan Ferrar</strong></a>, who kicked off day 2 of PAFOW with a detailed presentation based of our <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/8/9/nine-dimensions-for-excellence-in-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</em></a> model (see pic). The diagnostic is designed to help people analytics leaders identify and prioritise the dimensions to create more impact and value from your people analytics work.       </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Day two of PAFOW primarily saw the floor given to the vendor community as some of the most innovative technologies in the field were presented to an eager audience. </p>, <p>Industry analyst <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Stacia Garr</strong></a> kicked off the technology sessions with a walk through the maze of the people analytics technology landscape. The space is so dynamic, complex and innovative that many practitioners struggle to keep up with the market, which makes navigating the multitude of vendors extremely difficult.</p>, <p>As such, the research partnership outlined by Stacia that her company <a href=""https://redthreadresearch.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">RedThread Research</a> will be embarking on in 2019 with PAFOW and <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> was much appreciated by the practitioners in the audience. </p>, <p>The research will cover three key areas:</p>, <p>If you want to have a say in helping to shape the research head over to <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NGNKLHS"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>the survey at peopleanalyticstech.com and provide your comments by 22 February</strong></a>.</p>, <p>The breadth and depth of the vendors that presented and/or exhibited at PAFOW highlighted the continued investment, innovation, growth and diversity of the people analytics technology space.</p>, <p>PAFOW filmed the 13 vendors that presented - as well as the speeches by Stacia Garr, Jonathan Ferrar and me. These recordings will be made available via the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4gpRezhHS1hsQIE3Fcp5bQ"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW YouTube channel</a> in the coming weeks, so look out for those. For now, check out the vendors, which fell into the following broad categories:</p>, <p>A word also for the other vendors that exhibited at PAFOW: Cultivate, Splashbi, Office Vibe, People Insight, AON and HCMI. </p>, <p>Last but not least, a special mention should go to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-uchacz/"" target=""_blank"">Jessalyn Urchaz</a>, who despite having to cope with a technical fault that meant she was unable to show her slides, delivered a spellbinding speech on how Microsoft’s Workplace Analytics supports behavioural change within organisations.</p>, <p>Perhaps the best indication of the buzz created by PAFOW has been the response since the conference ended in San Francisco, which has seen the following blogs and mini-LinkedIn takeaway summaries published already:</p>, <p>Also stay tuned to the <a href=""https://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW site</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4gpRezhHS1hsQIE3Fcp5bQ"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW YouTube Channel</a> for pics and videos from the event. </p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>First, a huge thank you to Al and the rest of the PAFOW team: Liz Hammond, Chris Broderick and Dafna Aaronson (all in pic with Al and me below) as well as Blake Humble, Cameron Ellis, Jason Smith, Sarah Spernenn, Barry Swales and Jeff Brown.</p>, <p>The best conferences put networking at the front and centre of proceedings and PAFOW does this par excellence.

David R. Green,"February 7, 2019",The best HR & People Analytics articles of January 2019,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-january-2019-david-green/,"[<p>It’s been a lightning start to 2019 for the field of people analytics. I had the honour of speaking at and being co-chair with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> of the biggest and most successful People Analytics &amp; Future of Work (PAFOW) yet in <a href=""https://pafow.com/pafow19/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">San Francisco</a> last week.

This was reflected by many of the speakers at PAFOW including <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyushmathur/"" target=""_blank"">Piyush Mathur</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-whiteman-ph-d-02a8097/"" target=""_blank"">Heather Whiteman</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwhite612/"" target=""_blank"">David White</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bahubbard/"" target=""_blank"">Brad Hubbard</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardrosenow/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Rosenow</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>. It is also evidenced in the innovation being brought into the space from the vendor community, which witnessed more consolidation with the news last week that Culture Amp had acquired continuous performance management company Zugata (read <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Garr</a>’s article on the acquisition <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/smart-first-buy-culture-amp-acquires-zugata-stacia-sherman-garr/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p>, <p>The continued health and innovation in the field is also demonstrated in the quality and diversity of articles I’ve selected for this month’s collection. This proved to be one of the hardest selections yet as the longlist extended to 30 articles, all of which that would have been a shoo-in not so long ago.</p>, <p>The selections cover topics such as market analysis, workforce planning, organisational network analysis, diversity and inclusion, leadership and culture, creating a data-driven culture within HR and a number of hugely insightful articles by people analytics leaders. If that wasn’t enough then the first article from Accenture may well be the best published yet on the opportunity offered by successfully harnessing workforce data with trust to provide benefit to business and workers alike and unlock the massive economic opportunity offered by people analytics.</p>, <p>Enjoy, and if you do and haven’t yet done so, please <a href=""http://eepurl.com/dqO4_5"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">subscribe to my Data Driven HR newsletter</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A monumental study from Accenture on the risks and rewards inherent in harnessing workforce data and people analytics to unlock organisational DNA. There are a multitude of insights offered throughout the 68 pages not least that the if companies create trust – and therefore unlock the value of workforce data – the growth for the 6,000 largest publicly listed global companies alone equates to more than US$3 trillion. The study nimbly balances insights from business leaders (e.g. 77% of business leaders say that new sources of workforce data will grow the business) and workers (e.g. 92% are open to the collection of data providing it improves their performance or wellbeing or provides other benefits). Having demonstrated the criticality of trust, the study then provides guidance on how to elevate people using technology, share responsibility and benefits, as well as maximise the value to employers – and people – of workforce data. Read the full report here and check out the Slideshare featuring highlights from the report below.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The long-awaited analysis of the HR technology market in 2019 from the world’s premier HR analyst does not disappoint. The headline prediction is that AI, productivity, and focus on the Employee Experience will drive technology investments in the year ahead. From a data driven HR perspective, and as Josh outlined in his keynote at PAFOW, people analytics is a key foundation of the 11 predictions outlined as the focus shifts towards productivity, performance and teams (see <strong><em>Fig 1</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong><em>: From HCM to Talent Management to HR in the Flow of Work (Source: Josh Bersin)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This Perspective on the state of people analytics in 2019 was compiled by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annatavis/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Tavis</a> for the winter edition of SHRM’s People + Strategy Journal. I was delighted to contribute the lead article, which looks at the growth in the field, provides examples of how Nielsen, Virgin Media and Clarks have used analytics to help drive business outcomes, and introduces the Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics model (see <strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong>) Jonathan Ferrar and I co-created in 2018. The other articles from a stellar list of contributors provide a counterpoint to my article and collectively show both the rising importance of people analytics, but also how the field is both broadening and deepening.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong><em>: Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics (Source: Jonathan Ferrar and David Green)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Creating a culture of data-based decision making is key to achieving sustainable success with people analytics.

In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin/"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a> outlines research she conducted as part of Visier’s The Age of People Analytics study, which found that the vast majority of HRBPs are still not comfortable when it comes to using data. Indeed, a key obstacle to success of people analytics identified by the study was “<em>we do not have a ‘data-driven’ skillset within HR and / or our HR business partners</em>.” Lexy then outlines a number of recommendations both for HRBPs themselves and organisations to support, track and measure improvement including <strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong>, which highlights the key capabilities that HRBPs need to be most effective as promoters of people analytics usage.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong><em>: Key capabilities HRBPs need to be most effective as promoters of people analytics usage (Source: Visier)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As I wrote at #10 of my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-touch-10-predictions-hr-2019-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">HR predictions for 2019</a>, the skills and knowledge areas required by HR professionals is undergoing a significant revolution. In this excellent summary, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveweisbeck/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Weisbeck</a> describes four essential skills that are increasingly being required: i) connecting HR Decisions to Business Outcomes, ii) data-based reasoning and innovation, iii) social intelligence, and iv) creative problem solving. These fit in nicely with the six knowledge areas where we are building out online training with the <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/academy/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">myHRfuture academy</a> (see <strong><em>FIG 4</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: </em></strong><em>Six knowledge areas for HR to focus on to prepare for the future of work (Source: myHRfuture)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Inspired by his search for a new CFO, Concentra CEO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupertmorrison/"" target=""_blank"">Rupert Morrison</a> describes his ‘eureka’ moment where he realised that HR could take a leaf out of Finance’s book by restructuring itself into two distinct parts: HR operations, and Organisational planning and analysis (OP&amp;A) (see <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>). Rupert goes on to outline some of the key business questions OP&amp;A would answer (e.g. How should the organisation be redesigned to better deliver the business strategy, Who does what work, who should do it, and what new skills are required) as well as detailing five steps for HR to be future ready.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>As FP&amp;A is to Finance, so OP&amp;A is to HR (Source: Rupert Morrison)</em></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>This article from McKinsey presents how by looking at their supply of skills and talent in a new light today, organisations can take actions that better prepare their companies for tomorrow’s challenges. The article provides several examples including from a European bank whose market position was being threatened by new, more savvy digital rivals as well as outlining a five-step methodology to adjust the shortage or surplus of skills in a workforce (see <strong><em>FIG 6</em></strong>). An enlightening read.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 6: </em></strong><em>Five methods offering a variety of ways to adjust the shortage or surplus of skills in a workforce (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>My favourite articles on people analytics are ones penned by those leading people analytics teams as they provide first-hand views on the progress and challenges in the space. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a> describes the three broad areas of impact his team at Capital One are focused on: influencing talent strategy and policy, empowering better decision making and empowering the workforce to be their best – watch out for an upcoming article I am collaborating with Guru on. Like Guru, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> has been building his people analytics team (at McKinsey) for two years. His article outlines the six-step methodology (see <strong><em>FIG 7</em></strong>), he has evolved to support decision making and increase business impact. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferreras/"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Ferreras</a>, who leads people analytics at Nordstorm, uses a powerful example to warn of the danger of going down the rabbit hole of ‘best practice’ when comparing your own organisation against industry benchmarks and published research and case studies.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 7: </em></strong><em>The Analytics lifecycle (Source: Keith McNulty)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A tongue-in-cheek but painfully accurate list of 20 steps companies typically adopt to undermine and diminish the impact of advanced analytics teams. Whilst Ritesh’s article examines the impact on enterprise analytics teams, many of the examples offered are certainly relevant to people analytics too.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amedmondson/"" target=""_blank"">Amy Edmondson</a>, the Novartis Professor of Leadership and Management at Harvard Business School, was the first to identify the concept of psychological safety in work teams in 1999. Her research was the foundation of the famous <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Project Aristotle</a> study Google’s People Analytics team published a few years ago. In this excerpt from her new book, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Organization-Psychological-Workplace-Innovation/dp/1119477247"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Fearless Organization</a>, Amy describes three steps leaders can take to create psychological safety (see also <strong><em>FIG 8</em></strong>), the prerequisite for greater innovation and growth. Read alongside <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamishmore/"" target=""_blank"">Hamish More</a>’s terrific article on why an environment of psychological safety is required to successfully hire for team-fit and diversity.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8</em></strong><em>: The Leader’s Tool Kit for Building Psychological Safety (Source: Amy Edmondson, The Fearless Organization)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) continues to rise in importance as more companies adopt both the active and passive forms of network science to identify insights that drive collaboration, innovation, productivity and performance. This interview with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a>, Chief Talent Officer at GM and author of Adaptive Space, provides an illuminating insight into the opportunity for companies embracing ONA when it comes to organisational design.</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>One of the most powerful uses cases for ONA/People Analytics is in the domain of sales effectiveness. This case study describes how Microsoft combined passive ONA (calendar and email metadata) with organisational, CRM and sales outcome data to analyse the impact of a major sales transformation involving 20,000 people and over 100 countries. The analysis provided insights around critical areas such as internal and customer collaboration, ramp up of new hires, time spent with customers and impact on the business success of customers.</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>As this comprehensive report from BCG outlines, it is perplexing that with the level of effort companies have put into diversity that progress continues to be slow. Although most organisations now have diversity programs in place, the report finds that only 25% of employees in diverse groups feel that they have benefited. The report covers diversity in gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation as well as identifying specific solutions that can be implemented to accelerate progress. Diversity and inclusion is increasingly a focus for people analytics teams, so it is to be hoped that reports like these allied to a more data-driven approach will yield faster progress in this critical area sooner rather than later.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 9: </em></strong><em>The most effective Diversity initiatives (Source: BCG)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The Employee Engagement market continues to be subject to considerable disruption with Culture Amp’s acquisition of Zugata following hot on the heels of LinkedIn buying Glint and Qualtrics being snapped up by SAP. These articles collectively signify the change that is occurring. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> summarises nine trends that demonstrate the shift towards providing more benefit to employees. Next a terrific piece of investigative journalism from the Wall Street Journal highlights how a number of companies are trying to 'game' Glassdoor. This includes the insight that the share of 5 star Glassdoor ratings is now 28% of total ratings (see <strong><em>FIG 10</em></strong>). Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkverburg/"" target=""_blank"">Dirk Verburg</a> reminds us of the study by Harter et al, which found the significant impact of engagement on a myriad of business performance indicators. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpeoplegeek/"" target=""_blank"">Jason McPherson</a> examines the validity of the ‘best friend at work’ question, before Culture Amp colleague <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thestevenhuang/"" target=""_blank"">Steven Huang</a> outlines five D&amp;I questions you can include within your survey. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edans/"" target=""_blank"">Enrique Dans</a> looks at the emergence of Laszlo Bock’s Humu and the pros and cons of algorithmic based nudges that make personalised recommendations to workers on behaviours and how they work.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 10: </em></strong><em>Share of Glassdoor ratings by stars 2013-18 (Source: Wall Street Journal)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The article that arguably started it all and undoubtedly the one that brought people analytics to the attention of a wider audience – and certainly me – when it was published in 2010. The commentary, advice and case studies highlighted in this seminal HBR article still resonant today – not least the insight that Best Buy found that the value of a 0.1% increase in employee engagement was $100,000.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A selection of diverse and must-listen podcasts from February from three stalwarts of this medium.

David R. Green,"January 22, 2019",The rise of people analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-people-analytics-david-green/,"[<p>While interest in and adoption of people analytics has been rising steadily for a number of years, the rate of growth has surged in the last 18 months. The Corporate Research Forum's 2017 Strategic Workforce Analytics research found that 69 percent of organisations with 10,000 employees or more now have a people analytics team (1). Similarly, Bersin by Deloitte's 2017 High-Impact People Analytics research also found that 69 percent of companies are integrating HR data to build a 'single source of truth' data warehouse (2).</p>, <p>Consequently, there has been a swell of talent entering the field to feed this rapid rise in demand. According to a study by LinkedIn, there has been a three-fold increase since 2013 in the number of HR professionals in North America who list analytics skills in their profiles. </p>, <p>This phenomenon is not restricted to North America either. Global studies by LinkedIn, covering the APAC and EMEA regions, told a similar story with a 70-percent increase over the same five-year period in APAC, and a 61-percent rise in EMEA in the last 12 months alone (3). </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: </em></strong><em>The growth by region of HR professionals with skills in HR / People / Workforce analytics (Source: LinkedIn)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This sudden acceleration should not be seen as a surprise. People analytics— using insights from data to support decision-making—offers tremendous potential to organisations to drive business strategy, improve productivity and performance, and personalise and enhance the employee experience. </p>, <p>For a human resources discipline looking to assert itself in the new world of work, people analytics provides the basis for the function to boost its standing within the organisation and have a direct input to and impact on business strategy.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Three powerful examples of the positive impact of people analytics on business performance follow:</p>, <p>Nielsen, a global information, data, and measurement company with headquarters in New York City, found that for every 1-percent decrease of attrition, they could avoid $5 million in business costs. The same analysis identified internal mobility as the key driver of retention. As a result, leadership made it easier for employees to pursue opportunities within the company and an HR program was created to promote internal mobility. This program enabled Nielsen to save more than $10 million in the first eight months alone, increase the number of lateral moves, and was subsequently rolled out across the company (4).</p>, <p>UK footwear retailer Clarks found that engagement was a leading indicator of retail performance with a 1% improvement in engagement worth an additional 0.4% of improved business performance. Further analysis isolated the key drivers of engagement as team size in the store and tenure of the store manager. These insights enabled Clarks to develop a blueprint for high performing stores and HR to create a management development program to teach managers how to lead for high engagement (5).</p>, <p>UK telecoms company Virgin Media, a subsidiary of Liberty Global plc, discovered that in a 12 month period 7,500 customers cancelled their subscription within four weeks of being in the recruitment process as a result of direct candidate rejection or poor candidate experience. This equated to lost revenue of £4.4 million. As a result, Virgin Media used design thinking to radically overhaul its candidate experience journey to the extent that it is now viewed as a way to turn the previous £4.4 million loss into an opportunity to create a £5.3 million per year profit (6).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Despite evidence of the substantial benefits provided by people analytics, most organisations have barely scratched the surface of what is possible. </p>, <p>The good news is that the tide is turning. The people analytics space continues to attract new talent and is fiercely collaborative and open to sharing. This helps to accelerate progress, as do advances in technologies that enable real-time data collection and analysis of unstructured as well as structured data. As such, the rise of people analytics is set to continue as the discipline shifts from the periphery to the centre of the HR agenda. </p>, <p>People data is critical to helping businesses make decisions such as where to locate a new office or team, whether a merger or acquisition should proceed, and whether the organisation has the right number of employees and skill levels to deliver on the business strategy.</p>, <p>Developing capabilities in people analytics and supporting technologies to collect, store, and dynamically visualise data enables companies to put this information at the fingertips of the business leaders. This “democratisation” of data can also help guide managers on employee development and employees to better manage their performance and careers.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, the quest to make HR a data-driven function is not easy. Common challenges I regularly encounter when speaking to practitioners include concerns in areas such as data quality, HR capability and credibility, ethics and privacy, and making analytical insights actionable. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong><em>: Four groups that benefit from People Analytics (Source: David Green)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Even in organisations that have developed reasonable capability in people analytics, I am regularly asked three questions: How can I improve my impact? How can I create more value? What should I focus on?</p>, <p>This prompted Jonathan Ferrar and I to create the <em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</em> model (7), which is now being used by a number of global organisations who are members of <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/the-people-analytics-program/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>The People Analytics Program</em></a> to help drive increased impact in the discipline of people analytics. </p>, <p>The nine dimensions are grouped into three categories: foundational aspects (governance, methodology, and stakeholders), resources (skills, technology, and data), and value (workforce experiences, business outcomes, and culture). </p>, <p>In my experience, companies that have advanced capabilities across each of the nine dimensions are the ones that are enjoying the most benefit from people analytics and also the ones driving the field forward.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: </em></strong><em>The Nine Dimensions of Excellence in People Analytics (Source: Jonathan Ferrar, David Green, Insight222)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst not the sole reason, the fact that a recent study by Visier (8) reported that advanced organisations with a high level of people analytics process maturity financially outperform their peers is a good indicator that companies will continue to invest in people analytics. </p>, <p>People analytics is no longer a nice-to-have for companies but an absolute must-have for any Chief HR Officer that wants to provide a positive impact to the business, its employees, and ultimately to secure the future of the HR function itself. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The original version of 'The rise of people analytics' appeared as the lead article in a special Perspectives on <a href=""https://www.hrps.org/resources/people-strategy-journal/Winter2019/Pages/perspectives.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside-Out People Analytics</a> in the <a href=""https://www.hrps.org/resources/people-strategy-journal/Winter2019/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Winter 2019</a> edition of SHRM's People + Strategy Journal.

David R. Green,"January 7, 2019",Top 40 HR & People Analytics articles of 2018,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-40-hr-people-analytics-articles-2018-david-green/,"[<p>2018 proved to be a momentous year for people analytics as an increasing number of organisations embraced a data-driven approach to HR and people decisions.</p>, <p>According to a <a href=""https://www.crforum.co.uk/research-and-resources/research-report-strategic-workforce-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">study</a> from the Corporate Research Forum, 69% of large organisations (10,000+ employees) now have a people analytics team. Whilst <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/talent-intelligence/workforce/pdfs/Final_EMEA_Rise-of-Analytics-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">research</a> by LinkedIn found that the number of professionals in the EMEA region who list people analytics or HR analytics as a skill rose by 61% in the twelve months to June 2018 (regional research for <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/talent-intelligence/workforce/pdfs/NAMER---Rise-of-Analytics-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">North America</a> and <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/cx/2018/pdf/full-report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">APAC</a> saw similar growth).</p>, <p>Even more tellingly, Visier’s <a href=""https://www.visier.com/clarity/3-things-we-learned-from-the-age-of-people-analytics-report/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Age of People Analytics</a> study identified that the profit margins of organisations with advanced capability in people analytics are 56% higher than those of their peers. Statistics like this suggests that people analytics is here to stay.</p>, <p>For the last five years I have collated and published a collection of the ‘best’ articles of the preceding 12 months – see <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-2014-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2014</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21-best-hr-analytics-articles-2015-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2015</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/30-best-hr-analytics-articles-2016-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2016</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-40-hr-people-analytics-articles-2017-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2017</a> and following are my choices for the 40 best articles of 2018.</p>, <p>Why 40? I have to concede that it is partly down to my inability to prune down to 30 or 20 - although it was hard enough to get it down to 40! On a positive note, choosing to include 40 articles means I’ve been able to reflect the sheer diversity of how analytics is being applied to people decisions. The sheer quality and quantity of articles that have been published over the last 12 months also demonstrates the progress of the field. Together the articles selected should act as a venerable resource library for those working, researching or interested in the people analytics space. That is certainly the intention.</p>, <p>I have arranged the 40 articles into ten topics: State of the market, Future of work, The evolution of HR, Building capability, Articles by people analytics leaders, Ethics, Organisational Network Analysis, Employee experience and wellbeing, Diversity and Getting started before highlighting a few of my own articles at the end.</p>, <p>I hope you enjoy the articles selected, and if you do please do <a href=""http://eepurl.com/dqO4_5"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">subscribe</a> to my Data Driven HR newsletter.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There was a slew of excellent research published on people analytics in 2018 including the CRF, LinkedIn and Visier studies I’ve already referenced plus others by the likes of Josh Bersin, i4CP and IBM, which I collected together in my <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/blog/2018/8/21/data-driven-hr-4-research-on-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Compendium of People Analytics Research</a>. One example that perfectly captures the current state and future direction of people analytics comes from the CIPD…</p>, <p>The CIPD research provides a host of insights, not least that a strong people analytics culture leads to positive business outcomes as well as <strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong> below, which suggests that confidence in conducting analysis varies significantly in the regions covered by the research. It is interesting that the UK displays a distinct lack of confidence in analytics comparative to their peers. Features outstanding analysis from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Ed Houghton</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mel-green/"" target=""_blank"">Mel Green</a>, an astute Foreword by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/petercheese/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cheese</a> and significant contributions from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugeneburke/"" target=""_blank"">Eugene Burke</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-charlwood-14049622/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Charlwood</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: </em></strong><em>HR professionals in the UK lack the confidence to conduct advanced people analytics (Source: CIPD)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There’s a lot of buzz and a fair sprinkling of hype associated with the future of work and the likely consequences for HR. As I wrote in my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-touch-10-predictions-hr-2019-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2019 Predictions for HR</a>, research by the likes of the World Economic Forum and McKinsey suggests that AI will actually create more jobs than it replaces (which, will no doubt disappoint the doomsayers). Moreover, these new jobs will enable us to be more creative, more impactful and more human. As IBM’s recent research declares there is a strong <a href=""https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=81019981USEN"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">business case for AI in HR</a> but you can’t build AI in HR if you suck at people data and analytics. This all points to people analytics continuing to rise in prominence in the years ahead. Three articles pointing the way forward and laying out the opportunity for people analytics and HR follow:</p>, <p>Will the inexorable rise of technology render humans obsolete in the workplace or instead will the work humans do be continually reinvented? These are the two scenarios considered by the authors in this taster to their landmark book <a href=""https://hbr.org/product/reinventing-jobs-a-4-step-approach-for-applying-automation-to-work/10174-HBK-ENG"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Reinventing Jobs</em></a>. As the title suggests, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravinjesuthasan/"" target=""_blank"">Ravin Jesuthasan</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> believe the second scenario will prevail and as this transformation takes hold, humans will actually become more valuable in ways that would not be possible without automation. The frameworks outlined in the article (see example in <strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong>) are provided to help leaders consider how work should be ‘deconstructed’. A powerful example is also provided that analyses the job of pilots and flight attendants.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: </em></strong><em>A framework for optimising human and automated work (Source: Reinventing Jobs, Jesuthasan and Boudreau, Harvard Business Press, 2018)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Following up his brilliant <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-30-al-adamsen/"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics 3.0</a> article from 2017, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> examines the workforce composition of the future and introduces his Work Framework model to outline the value and changing make-up of the workforce (employees, contractors, consultants, outsource partners, machines etc). Al also outlines a model for Employee Experience Design (see <strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong>) and highlights how in tandem with a positive culture this can lead to improvements in engagement, retention, productivity, innovation and ultimately financial performance. As Al outlines, this challenge represents a unique opportunity for HR and People Analytics to lead the way and ensure that not only the organisation benefits, but employees do too.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: </em></strong><em>A model for Employee Experience Design (Source: Al Adamsen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Unilever is one of the companies setting the pace when it comes to incorporating AI, analytics and data into HR. In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> describes how Unilever has partnered with Pymetrics to screen and assess 1.8m job applicants per year. As well as enhancing the candidate experience, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nairleena/"" target=""_blank"">Leena Nair</a> (Unilever’s CHRO) confirms that the automated system has saved 70,000 hours previously spent on interviewing and assessing candidates. The article also describes Unabot, a NLP based bot that supports onboarding by providing information to employees when asked and which has already been successfully rolled out in 36 of Unilever’s 190 markets.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>HR is facing unprecedented change and increased expectations on the value and impact it needs to provide to the business – and employees. As such, the skills and capabilities required by HR professionals are also undergoing seismic change. Five articles describing the opportunity for the function - if it can evolve - follow, with the need to get jiggy with data front and centre.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> underlines the unprecedented change work is undergoing, and the extent to which this will revolutionise the capabilities HR needs to consequently develop in the coming years. Keith describes the evolution of HR, from 1.0 (predominantly focused on administration and industrial relations) to 2.0 (business partner, use of data restricted to reporting), and then argues that HR now needs to shift to 3.0. This third version of HR, as Keith explains, requires a more strategic focus in three ways: i) people analytics will be at HR’s core, ii) the HR function will be more agile and efficient, and iii) HR professionals will need to have better business acumen and possess problem-solving skills. This is one of many superb articles written by Keith in 2018 as his <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-human-capital-data-science-writing-compendium-2018-keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">compendium of writings</a> from the year ably demonstrates.</p>, <p>As Hung Lee described in a <a href=""http://www.recruitingbrainfood.com/issues/on-hiring-it-s-recruiting-brainfood-for-the-week-ahead-issue-115-151143"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">recent edition</a> of his excellent Brainfood newsletter, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laetitia-vitaud-1058ba82/"" target=""_blank"">Laetitia Vitaud</a><strong> </strong>is a quite brilliant analyst on the future of work. In this pair of articles, Laetitia first looks at how AI offers HR the opportunity to personalise the services it offers to employees. The second article, which Hung also featured, examines how changing workforce demands will transform the responsibility of ‘HR’.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Agility is described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> as the key organisational capability of our time. He goes on to explain that in our world of unrelenting change agility matters at four levels: strategic, organisational, individual and last but not least HR. Ulrich’s persuasive argument that “<em>HR practices around people, performance, information, and work can be crafted to foster strategic, organisation, and individual agility</em>” is both convincing and inspiring.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: </em></strong><em>The critical organisational capabilities to win have pivoted over time (Source: Dave Ulrich)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this compelling article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> defines design thinking and how it can be applied to shift HR’s thinking beyond its typical process-driven and programmatic approach to service delivery. Ian explains that HR's should focus instead on the experience and outcomes that it is looking to drive particularly with regards to creating and personalising the employee experience.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>March's HBR had a triumvirate of terrific articles on how tech is transforming HR under the banner of ‘<em>The new rules of talent management</em>’. The lead article from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-cappelli-14936a3/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cappelli</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annatavis/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Tavis</a> describes how the HR function is ""<em>finally getting its long awaited overhaul</em>"". Then an interview with CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-gherson-1b93b77/"" target=""_blank"">Diane Gherson</a> outlines how IBM has radically co-created the employee experience through a lens of the employee as customer. The third article from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicsbarton/"" target=""_blank"">Dominic Barton</a>, Dennis Carey and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcharan/"" target=""_blank"">Ram Charan</a> provides another case study, this time from ING, and describes how agile methodologies were used to design a team-based approach to deploying, developing, and assessing talent.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A major highlight for me in 2018 was working with Jonathan Ferrar to create the <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/nine-dimensions/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People</em></a> model and diagnostic for our member companies at Insight222. Jonathan’s article describing the model and four others under the building capability theme are presented below.</p>, <p>During 2018, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> and I mulled over the three key questions we regularly get asked by people analytics leaders: How can I improve my impact? How can I create more value? What should I focus on? This formed the basis for our <em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</em> model, which we created in the weeks following our discussion, and is now being used by several organisations to help evaluate, focus and prioritise their people analytics strategies. Jonathan’s article outlines each of the nine dimensions, which we grouped in three categories: foundational aspects, resources and value (see <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>). If you are a people analytics leader who wants to find out more, please <a href=""http://mailto:david.green@insight222.com?subject=RE:%20Nine%20Dimensions%20for%20Excellence%20in%20People%20Analytics%20model%20|%20Best%20People%20Analytics%20Articles%20for%20September"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">get in touch</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>The Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics - Value (Source: Jonathan Ferrar and David Green)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Two closely related articles from one of my favourite researchers in the space <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin/"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a>. First, Lexy outlines seven key responsibilities for CHROs to play an active role in selecting, enabling and modelling usage of people analytics within their companies. These include driving the vision for success as well as coaching business leaders on the value and outcome of analytics and establishing governance related to data privacy and ROI. Lexy’s second article looks at the pivotal role of the Head of People Analytics. Her analysis draws out the unique set of skills required to thrive in this challenging role, the reporting line (ideally direct to the CHRO), how to harness technology, drive change and create value.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Some of the best and most consistently excellent research on analytics comes from McKinsey. Here is a selection of articles published in 2018. The red flags identified in the first article include the absence of a clear vision from the executive team with regards to analytics, costly data cleansing exercises and an inability to attribute bottom line impact. Another red flag - the lack of analytics translators – is explored more deeply in the second article. Then insights are provided on how leading organisations are scaling analytical capability before the critical importance of data culture is addressed in the final article.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a> clearly sets out the importance of improving the data literacy of HR professionals. As Madhura describes (and as illustrated in <strong><em>FIG 6</em></strong><em> </em>below), the companies that develop advanced and sustainable capability in people analytics are those that focus on creating a culture of data-based decision making beyond that of the people analytics team itself.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 6: </em></strong><em>Percentage of organisations reporting basic data literacy skills by maturity level and function (Source: Bersin by Deloitte) </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing the theme of data literacy, this article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> first provides a smart categorisation of HR professionals that are analytically savvy, willing or resistant (see <strong><em>FIG 7</em></strong>), before describing ways you can hire for and/or develop analytical capability.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 7</em></strong><em>: Three categories of HR professionals and their analytical capabilities (Source: Nigel Guenole and Sheri Feinzig)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’m fortunate to spend a fair proportion of my time meeting with people analytics leaders and their teams. There are some seriously smart, passionate and collaborative people in these roles. Following are a selection of articles from people analytics leaders themselves, which taken together demonstrate that the space is in very capable hands.</p>, <p>A beautifully written piece by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a>, formerly people analytics leader at Apple. As Amit states at the outset ""<em>people analytics leaders are in the business of change management</em>"". He then proceeds to outline a clear vision on how this can be achieved drawing a clever parallel with his boyhood poem of choice “Where the Mind is Without Fear”.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetanjali-gamel-17209b68/"" target=""_blank"">Geetanjali Gamel</a> is passionate about her responsibility to develop the careers of her team in her role as Global Head of Workforce Analytics at Merck &amp; Co. In this interview with me, Geetanjali outlines the 'Three C Model' (see <strong><em>FIG 8</em></strong>) she uses to engender the development of her team. Our interview also covers: i) key attributes required by the people analytics leader, ii) how to create a data-driven culture, iii) ethics, and iv) what lies ahead for the field.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8: </em></strong><em>Creating career paths in people analytics - The Three 'C' model (Source: Geetanjali Gamel)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This article introduces <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a>’s ‘Second Wall for People Analytics’, which examines the challenge of developing continuous analytics. This leads neatly to the central topic of the article – the continuous listening journey at ABN AMRO (see <strong><em>FIG 9</em></strong>). <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-van-den-brink/"" target=""_blank"">Frank van den Brink</a> and Patrick define what ‘continuous listening’ means to the bank, describe the active and passive data sources in scope and then lay out the path ahead in this critical area of employee insight.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 9: </em></strong><em>The continuous listening journey at ABN Amro (Source: Patrick Coolen and Frank van den Brink)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Onboarding is a critical but often overlooked topic with bad experience and processes contributing to unnecessary and avoidable attrition. This case study describes how Microsoft’s People Analytics team combined qualitative (survey of new hires at seven and 90 days) and quantitative (calendar and email) data with engagement data to reveal insights to help inform the onboarding process moving forward. The key discovery being that it is critical for a new employee to have a one-on-one meeting with their manager during their first week. Those who did saw early growth in three key areas: network strength and centrality, better quality meetings and early team collaboration. Dawn’s article on another project that sought to gather insights on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/managers-like-box-chocolates-dawn-klinghoffer/"" target=""_blank"">‘What makes a great manager’</a> is also a required read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> believes (as do I) that the majority of maturity models for people analytics are incomplete as they mostly focus on techniques rather than far more important aspects such as business outcomes. The model Thomas presents in this article is much more rooted in reality as the ‘happy toddlers’ become ‘grumpy teenagers’ before making the final transition to a mature people analytics team.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A superb guide from data scientist <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-richmond/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Richmond</a>, who founded the people analytics team at WeWork, on how to predict employee turnover using R. I frequently get asked for practical guides such as this, and Brian's article is detailed, well-written and highly educational. As Brian writes, employee turnover is a challenge for many organisations, so this is likely to be an indispensable resource for many budding people analysts.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The Kinks once warned of the dangers of being a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-JKWDC6fDs"" target=""_blank"">dedicated follower of fashion</a>, and this excellent collaboration between <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottjuddpublic/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Judd</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-o-rourke-ph-d-7b304238/"" target=""_blank"">Eric O’Rourke</a> of Facebook’s people analytics team and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> suggests that the days of the humble employee survey may not be over yet. The team found that at Facebook surveys are still great predictors of behaviour, provide employees with the chance to be heard and are a great vehicle for changing behaviours.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As I wrote in <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/blog/2018/11/27/data-driven-hr-7-people-data-for-good"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘People Data for Good,’</a> ethics is arguably the most important element of people analytics and is a topic that continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing practitioners. It’s certainly a topic that we’ve explored in depth at <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> where we partnered with 15 of our member companies to <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/11/19/six-steps-to-ethically-sound-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">co-create an ethics charter</a> and guiding set of principles on the use of people data. Two superb articles on ethics from Josh Bersin and Ben Waber follow below:</p>, <p>Included as part of Deloitte’s Global Human Capital Trends for 2018, Josh Bersin describes the rapid growth of people analytics, the increase in the number and type of data sources being used, and the consequent risk this poses to privacy and data security. Josh highlights a potential blind spot (see <strong><em>FIG 10</em></strong>), where only a quarter of organisations are managing the potential impact of using people data on their consumer brand. 2018 was a particularly prolific year in terms of articles penned by Josh. Two other must-reads are his analyses of the ONA space (<a href=""https://joshbersin.com/2018/10/what-emails-reveal-about-your-performance-at-work/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">What Emails Reveal About Your Performance At Work</a>) and employee engagement market (<a href=""https://joshbersin.com/2018/10/employee-engagement-3-0-humu-launches-nudge-engine/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Employee Engagement 3.0</a>)</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 10: </em></strong><em>When it comes to people data, organisations are actively managing risks around employee perceptions and legal liability, but only a quarter are managing the potential impact on their consumer brand (Source: Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends)</em> </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Ben Waber takes a look at the multiple opportunities advances in technology and real-time data collection offer to the people analytics discipline. After outlining examples of how these technologies are e.g. helping reduce gender bias, fatigue and attrition, Ben walks through a playbook for the ethical and smart use of employee data (see <strong><em>FIG 11</em></strong>). As Ben concludes, the potential of people analytics to improve decision making is astounding, but failure by organisations to protect employee data could erode this potential for good.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 11: </em></strong><em>A Playbook for the ethical, smart use of employee data (Source: created by David Green from Ben Waber's 'The Happy Tracked Employee' article in HBR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As I explained in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><em>The Role of ONA in People Analytics</em></a>, Organisational Network Analysis is experiencing a renaissance as firms seek to gain insights into productivity and performance through analysing organisational networks and social capital. Three articles that document the burgeoning growth in ONA follow:</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/antony-ebelle-ebanda-07642b/"" target=""_blank"">Antony Ebelle-Ebanda</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> provide a terrific primer on what ONA is and why it is growing in importance. Most helpful are the practical examples offered on how ONA can be applied to support i) identification of HiPOs, ii) measurement of leadership behaviours (see example in <strong><em>FIG 12</em></strong>), iii) improving employee wellness, and iv) increasing diversity and inclusion.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 12: </em></strong><em>Quantified evidence of leaderships behaviours (Source: Greg Newman, TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> is leading the charge for ONA from a practitioner perspective in his work as Chief Talent Officer at GM and through his terrific book <a href=""https://www.adaptivespace.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Adaptive Space</em></a>. In this article, Michael contests that whilst human capital is undoubtedly a firm’s greatest asset, bringing <u>in</u> the best people is only part of the solution, and that organisations must also bring <u>out</u> the best in people. To do this entails a new frontier, unleashing social capital potential. Michael then outlines two primary aspects of social capital —group cohesion and brokerage— that are particularly relevant to future HR practices.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this brilliant HBR article <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-leonardi-45b67321/"" target=""_blank"">Paul Leonardi</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/noshcontractor/"" target=""_blank"">Noshir Contractor</a> contend that most people analytics teams rely on a narrow approach restricted to data on individuals. They argue that if the field is going to live up to the hype, analytics teams need to also explore data on the interplay between people to understand how they interact, who has influence, what fosters innovation etc. The result is one of the best articles I've read yet on the case for passive ONA (or as the authors describe it in the article – ‘relational analytics’). The Six Signatures of Relational Analytics that is presented (see <strong><em>FIG 13</em></strong>) covering Ideation, Influence, Efficiency, Innovation, Silos and Vulnerability is a powerful starting point for people analytics teams looking to mine the digital exhaust of their workforce. The future’s bright, the future’s ONA.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 13: </em></strong><em>Six signatures of relational analytics (Source: Paul Leonardi and Noshir Contractor)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/blog/2018/9/25/data-driven-hr-issue-5-employee-experience-special"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Employee Experience edition of Data Driven HR</a>, I explain that the potential of people analytics to help better understand, personalise and improve employee experience is considerable. Indeed, I believe this is THE biggest opportunity for people analytics. The first article below from Jeffrey Pfeffer helps establish the need for an employee centric approach and the four articles that follow provide an indication of the possibilities available and how people analytics can play a pivotal role.</p>, <p>In this interview about his 2018 book ‘<a href=""https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/dying-paycheck"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dying for a Paycheck</a>’, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-pfeffer-57a01b6/"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Pfeffer</a> provides a damning indictment on how the workplace is literally killing people. Not only do modern management practices engender stress, damage engagement and destroy the mental and physical health of employees, Pfeffer also emphasises the massive harm it causes company performance too. This is why the field of people analytics is so important as done well it can shine a light on the damage the practices cited by Pfeffer cause to organisational performance, team dynamics and individual well-being. One can only hope that business leaders around the world read Pfeffer’s book, heed his warnings, say enough is enough and reverse the damage they are causing.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the biggest focus areas for HR leaders continues to be the need to understand and improve employee experience. People analytics teams are increasingly at the forefront of efforts to analyse, design and personalise compelling work experiences across the employee lifecycle. As such, the maturity model outlined by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> (see also <strong><em>FIG 14</em></strong>) will undoubtedly assist many organisations in this effort. Look out for the examples provided on the ‘Moments that Matter’ in the employee journey. This is an approach and model that Volker and his team at <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TI People</a> have created together with over 20 member companies including the likes of BMW, Bosch, Cisco, Roche and Zalando.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 14: </em></strong><em>A maturity model for Employee Experience (Source: Volker Jacobs, TI People)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.cultureamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Culture Amp</a>’s Chief Scientist, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-mcpherson-0497209/"" target=""_blank"">Jason McPherson</a> examines the relationship between Glassdoor data and the annual benchmark data created from the aggregate engagement Culture Amp collects from its thousands of customers. The results are fascinating (see example in <strong><em>FIG 15</em></strong>) and as Jason writes point to some important trends, like the ability to use internal employee engagement data to predict how your company is perceived externally.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 15: </em></strong><em>The relationship between engagement and Glassdoor ratings (Source: Jason McPherson, Culture Amp)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a> has written a number of excellent articles on the role of people analytics in designing, measuring and deriving benefit from employee experience. This article, which provides four guiding principles to a successful continuous listening program – see the ‘4 C’s of Continuous Listening’ model in <strong><em>FIG 16</em></strong> below - may well be her best yet. </p>, <p><em> </em><strong><em>FIG 16: </em></strong><em>The 4 C's of Continuous Listening (Source: Laura Stevens)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> writes, most large organisations have vast amounts of employee text feedback that thus far they’ve done very little with (<strong><em>FIG 17</em></strong> provides some examples of the types of questions that can be answered with open-question employee text feedback). Given that this data is invariably the most valuable part of a questionnaire or survey, it is not surprising that many people analytics teams are looking to explore these potential gold mines. In the article, Andrew describes how to code or categorise employee feedback. The section on the difference between deductive and inductive coding is particularly illuminating even for this lay writer. For those that haven’t already subscribed to Andrew’s weekly <a href=""http://www.empiricalhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empirical HR newsletter</a>, I strongly recommend you do.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 17: </em></strong><em>Examples of questions that can be answered using text analysis (Source: Andrew Marritt) </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The case for diversity and inclusion in the workplace is compelling – not just because it is the right thing to do, but because numerous studies suggest it can drive better business performance too. As I write in the <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/blog/2018/10/30/data-driven-hr-6-diversity-and-inclusion"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Diversity and Inclusion edition of Data Driven HR</a>, with advances in technology and the growth of people analytics, HR increasingly has the tools it needs to promote and embed D&amp;I initiatives, and perhaps most critically prove that it can be a significant driver of business performance. Following are four superb articles on diversity.</p>, <p>If you want to understand the business case for diversity, look no further than this study from McKinsey. The key headline is the strong correlation between diversity and company financial performance. Companies in the top quartile for gender diversity were 21% more likely to experience above-average profitability than companies in the bottom quartile. For ethnic and cultural diversity, the likelihood of outperformance was even higher at 33%. The study is a treasure trove of information, and the advice offered (see <strong><em>FIG 18</em></strong>) on creating impact through diversity, which includes the use of analytics, is invaluable for HR and business leaders alike.</p>, <p><strong> <em>FIG 18: </em></strong><em>Four imperatives for building a successful inclusion and diversity (I&amp;D) strategy (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> presents some fascinating research on leadership effectiveness measured on 360 evaluations. The results (see <strong><em>FIG 19</em></strong>) show a stark difference between men and women with the gap widening as seniority increases. Morten's article outlines how women scored significantly higher on 12 out of 16 competencies (hard competencies as well as soft). Morten then examines four possible reasons for the results and provides a view on the effectiveness (or otherwise) of training to root out unconscious bias.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 19:</em></strong><em> Leadership effectiveness measured on 360 degree evaluations (Source: Zenger Folkman)</em></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Sherman Garr</a> summarises the highlights of her research collaboration with Mercer into the technologies that are helping drive diversity and inclusion forward. The research paper itself describes over 100 HR technology firms where diversity and inclusion is a focus or feature of their product as well as presenting numerous case studies. <strong><em>FIG 20</em></strong><em> </em>illustrates the focus areas of these technologies.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 20: </em></strong><em>Categories of D&amp;I Technology Within Talent Management Activities (Source: Stacia Sherman Garr, RedThread Research and Mercer)</em></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/suvarna-joshi-4823456b/"" target=""_blank"">Suvarna Joshi</a> describes four examples of how passive ONA can provide fresh sets of data to help organisations measure the impact of diversity and inclusion. These include i) Understanding gender differences in networking behaviour, ii) Measuring inclusion of diverse groups, and; iii) Identifying hidden stars (see <strong><em>FIG 21</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 21: </em></strong><em>Significant gender differences in networking behaviour (Source: TrustSphere)</em> </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’m approached at least three times a week by organisations looking to get people analytics off the ground. The first point to make is it’s never too late to start! The second is that there are an increasing abundance of resources to help. Five examples follow below to which I would also add the recent ‘<a href=""https://www.cipd.co.uk/knowledge/strategy/analytics/practitioner-guide"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Getting started with people analytics: a practitioner's guide</a>’ guide written by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68/"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Ed Houghton</a> on behalf of the CIPD.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardrosenow/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Rosenow</a> has rapidly become a tour de force within our space. This article is the ideal starting place for anyone interested in data driven HR. Richard collects together the best people analytics articles, case studies, books, podcasts, courses, advisory firms and conferences. It’s a veritable treasure trove of information that demands a mandatory bookmark.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geverduin/"" target=""_blank"">Giovanni Everduin</a> provides three steps to getting started with people analytics and gives primacy to formulating questions that are not just aimed at HR but are ones that the organisation’s leadership team want answered. Giovanni, who built people analytics from the ground-up at Tanfeeth, also highlights the importance of balancing small vs. big data as well as the imperative of getting the buy-in and active participation of key stakeholders within your company. Without this, you will not succeed.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Having good business acumen is a critical element of delivering value with people analytics, but what does this mean? As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> describes, good business acumen essentially means “<em>having the experience and wisdom to see the bigger picture and to be able to evaluate (in the case of analytics) whether a project is worth doing</em>”. Tracey then proceeds to provide some helpful guidance on how to establish whether a project has value as well as some practical steps to consider around areas such as privacy and security and the all- important question as to whether the organisation can/will act on the findings. For those that haven’t subscribed already, Tracey’s <a href=""https://www.numericalinsights.com/news/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Numerical Insights blog</a> is an absolute gold mine of material on data-driven HR.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this four-part series for HR Zone, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> outlines his model of Scientific People Analytics (SPA), and the many benefits it brings to businesses. Part 1 provides the rationale behind the methodology. Part 2 explains why SPA is useful for supporting human capital decisions made by organisational managers. Part 3 presents a methodology for deploying scientific people analytics – see <strong><em>FIG 22</em></strong> below, and Part 4 compares scientific people analytics to non-scientific people analytics approaches.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 22: </em></strong><em>Model for Scientific People Analytics (Source: Max Blumberg)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>What is the secret of a good HR dashboard? That is the question pondered by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman/"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a> in his article. He argues that instead of continually falling into the trap of redefining the right metrics, tirelessly cleaning data and inventing new visualisations we should instead base our dashboards on questions. Creelman goes on to provide an example (see <strong><em>FIG 23</em></strong>) emphasising the need to compose your dashboard with the right questions, as a precursor to then using data to provide answers.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 23: </em></strong><em>Example of a HR dashboard composed of questions (Source: David Creelman and Peter Navin - The CMO of People: Manage Employees Like Customers With an Immersive Predictable Experience That Drives Productivity and Performance)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I collected together my 30+ articles from last year in my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2018-year-review-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2018 Review</a>.

What case studies and resources are available?</p>, <p>In this article, I examine some of the ethical dilemmas of working with people data, summarise research I contributed to on the topic whilst I was at IBM and offer guidance to organisations looking to embed an ethical approach to their people analytics programs.</p>, <p>A two-part series together with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a>, Global Head of People Analytics at Pfizer.

Green,"December 31, 2018",2018: A Year in Review,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2018-year-review-david-green/,"[<p>It’s been a huge year for data driven HR as people analytics continues to grow into an indispensable component of any forward-thinking organisation’s strategy for surviving and thriving in the future of work.</p>, <p>A <a href=""https://www.crforum.co.uk/research-and-resources/research-report-strategic-workforce-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">study</a> by the Corporate Research Forum found that 69% of large organisations (10,000+ employees) now has a people analytics team. Whilst <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/talent-intelligence/workforce/pdfs/Final_EMEA_Rise-of-Analytics-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">research</a> by LinkedIn identified that the number of professionals on the platform with people analytics as a skill rose by 61% in the twelve months to June 2018. As such it seems safe to say that data-driven HR has truly arrived.</p>, <p>2018 has also been a big year personally. I left IBM, founded Zandel, created my <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">website</a> and took up board advisory roles at <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a>, <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> and <a href=""https://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW</a>. I’ve been fortunate to speak all over the world in cities including Sydney, Melbourne, Singapore, St Petersburg, Toronto, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Zürich, Budapest, Copenhagen and London.</p>, <p>This was also the year that I created my <a href=""https://us18.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=e0b52874f211caf2aa39d4929&amp;id=8848ad53e3"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Data Driven HR newsletter</a> (where the original version of this article was first published) and I am humbled that over 5,000 people have already subscribed. I hope that Data Driven HR has proved to be a useful resource on people analytics, employee experience and the future of work and will endeavour to make it even better in 2019. If you already receive and enjoy Data Driven HR, share the love and please encourage your friends and colleagues to <a href=""http://eepurl.com/dqO4_5"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">subscribe</a>.</p>, <p>Before we move into the review of 2018, I'd like to wish each and every one of you a <strong>Happy New Year</strong> as well as health, happiness and success for 2019. </p>, <p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>As we approach the end of 2018 and look back at the past 12 months, I thought I’d create an anthology of my 30+ articles from the year. Hopefully, having them all in one place will prove as useful to readers as it will likely prove to me!</p>, <p>As the original version of this article was the eighth Data Driven HR newsletter, it’s probably sensible to start by summarising the preceding seven editions. The basic formula being that I pick a theme related to data driven HR and then curate a selection of some of the best writings on the subject together with my own. The seven topics covered to date are: <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/blog/2018/11/27/data-driven-hr-7-people-data-for-good"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>People Data for Good</strong></a>, <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/blog/2018/10/30/data-driven-hr-6-diversity-and-inclusion"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Diversity and Inclusion</strong></a>, <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/blog/2018/9/25/data-driven-hr-issue-5-employee-experience-special"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Employee Experience</strong></a>, a <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/blog/2018/8/21/data-driven-hr-4-research-on-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Compendium of research on People Analytics</strong></a>, <a href=""https://us18.campaign-archive.com/?u=e0b52874f211caf2aa39d4929&amp;id=350f240dbe"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Organisational Network Analysis</strong></a> and the <a href=""https://us18.campaign-archive.com/?u=e0b52874f211caf2aa39d4929&amp;id=e8be94fcea"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Future of Work</strong></a> as well as the inaugural Data Driven HR, which focused on the <a href=""https://us18.campaign-archive.com/?u=e0b52874f211caf2aa39d4929&amp;id=b53d7bbb9b"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Datification of HR</strong></a>.</p>, <p>ONA continues to be one of the most talked about and fastest growing areas of people analytics as firms increasingly learn the value and insights offered through better understanding its social capital and how work actually gets done. My article on ‘<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><strong>The role of ONA in People Analytics</strong></a>’ intends to demystify the topic as well as answer the following questions I am regularly asked on the subject: What is ONA? Why is ONA rising in importance? What is the difference between active and passive ONA? What business questions can I answer with ONA? Who are the vendors driving innovation in the ONA space? What case studies and resources are available?</p>, <p>Ethics is the most important element of people analytics and also one of the main challenges for practitioners. In ‘<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dont-forget-h-hr-ethics-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Don’t forget the ‘H’ in HR</strong></a>’, I examine some of the ethical dilemmas of working with people data, summarise research I contributed to on the topic whilst I was at IBM and offer guidance to organisations looking to embed an ethical approach to their people analytics programs.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the highlights for me in 2018 was getting involved in creating two online courses on <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">myHRfuture</a>. If you are looking to learn more about data driven HR, my ‘<a href=""https://academy.myhrfuture.com/p/introduction-to-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>An Introduction to People Analytics</strong></a>’ course with Jonathan Ferrar may help accelerate your learning.

Having attended and spoken at the shows organised by Marc Coleman and his intrepid team since the first event back in 2011, it was a real thrill to take on the extra responsibility. I also spoke at the shows in London (on ethics) and Las Vegas (on ONA) as well as moderating the Smart Data breakout at both shows. The growth of UNLEASH in the US has been particularly impressive – my key takeaways from the show: <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/news/6-takeaways-from-unleash-america"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>The revolution will be televised</strong></a> should help explain why.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’ve written a number of articles on the continued growth of people analytics over the past 12 months.</p>, <p>Another highlight of the past 12 months was working with Jonathan Ferrar to create the <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/8/9/nine-dimensions-for-excellence-in-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</strong></a> model and diagnostic for Insight222 members (the link is to Jonathan's article describing the model).</p>, <p><em>Source: The Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics - Value (Jonathan Ferrar and David Green)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Most of you will be aware that I curate a monthly round-up of my favourite people analytics and data-themed articles.

David R. Green,"December 20, 2018",The best HR & People Analytics articles of December 2018,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-december-2018-david-green/,"[<p>Yes, I know that there are still a few days left before December closes and a New Year begins, but given I start my Christmas holiday tomorrow I wanted to publish the ‘Best Articles’ for December before I submerge myself in mince pies.</p>, <p>I had expected December to be a quiet month for articles – save those looking back on 2018 and the usual glut of articles predicting what will occur in 2019. But, I was wrong. The selections that follow are especially strong and reinforce how 2018 has been a pivotal year for people analytics and data-driven HR.</p>, <p>If I had to pick out two of the selections that point the way forward, it is those penned first by Ravin Jesuthasan and John Boudreau. Every business leader, CHRO and Head of People Analytics should read their article on the Future of Work. The strategic questions laid out are ones that every organisation will have to answer if it is to thrive moving forward. The second must-read article comes from Al Adamsen on the unique role HR needs to play in designing appropriate strategies to contend with how work gets done in the future and the workforce composition required to deliver it.   </p>, <p>I have also included a selection of predictions for 2019 towards the end of this article – including my own <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-touch-10-predictions-hr-2019-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">‘The Human Touch’</a>. Together they show that whilst HR is undoubtedly being disrupted like never before, it is also one of the most exciting areas of the business in which to work and the opportunities to increase our impact through better understanding the business as well as being more data-driven and employee centric are enormous.</p>, <p>Before we get on with this month’s selections, I just wanted to wish readers a Merry Christmas, happy holidays as well as a happy and successful 2019. </p>, <p>Right, on we go…  </p>, <p>Will the inexorable rise of technology render humans obsolete in the workplace or instead will the work humans do be continually reinvented? These are the two scenarios considered by the authors in this taster to their landmark book <a href=""https://hbr.org/product/reinventing-jobs-a-4-step-approach-for-applying-automation-to-work/10174-HBK-ENG"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Reinventing Jobs</em></a>. As the title of the book suggests, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravinjesuthasan/"" target=""_blank"">Ravin Jesuthasan</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> believe the second scenario will prevail and as this transformation takes hold, humans will actually become more valuable in ways that would not be possible without automation. The frameworks outlined in the article (see example in <strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong>) are provided to help leaders consider how work should be ‘deconstructed’. A powerful example is provided analysing the job of pilots and flight attendants. The issue of Workforce Solutions Review in which this article appears is also recommended - see <a href=""http://www.ihrimpublications.com/amember/WSR_Archives/WSR_October-December18.php"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> - as it also contains a number of other interesting analytics themed reads from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/royaltman/"" target=""_blank"">Roy Altman</a> (on using analytics to support organisational agility), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-friedman-b9450011/"" target=""_blank"">Helen Friedman</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annawmarley/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Marley</a> (on whether HR Business Partners are helping or hindering efforts to become more evidence based) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-higgins-5875082/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Higgins</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: A framework for optimising human and automated work (Source: Reinventing Jobs, Jesuthasan and Boudreau, Harvard Business Press, 2018)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Following up his brilliant <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-30-al-adamsen/"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics 3.0</a> article from last year, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> examines the workforce composition of the future and introduces his Work Framework model to outline the value and changing make-up of the workforce (employees, contractors, consultants, outsource partners, machines etc). Al also outlines a model for Employee Experience Design (see <strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong>) and highlights that in tandem with a positive culture how this can lead to improvements in engagement, retention, productivity, innovation and ultimately financial performance. As Al outlines, this challenge represents a unique opportunity for HR and People Analytics to lead the way and ensure that not only the organisation benefits, but employees do too. If you want to see Al speaking about how HR manages the amoeba, check out the section later on the <a href=""https://pafow.com/pafow19/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work conference</a> in San Francisco on 31st January and 1st February.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: Employee Experience Design (Source: Al Adamsen)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Agility is described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> in his article on HR.com as the key organisational capability of our time. He goes on to explain that in our world of unrelenting change agility matters at four levels: strategic, organisational, individual and last but not least HR. Ulrich’s persuasive argument that “<em>HR practices around people, performance, information, and work can be crafted to foster strategic, organisation, and individual agility</em>” is both convincing and inspiring.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: The critical organisational capabilities to win have pivoted over time (Source: Dave Ulrich)</em></strong></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiparkcoll/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Arkcoll</a> provides an example of how organisational network analysis was used to answer a key question from a business leader: “Is our turnover problem contagious?” In other words, when a key employee goes does this make their peers more vulnerable to leaving too? Based on his study, Philip found that yes it does, with direct peers being two to three times more likely to exit when an employee exits a team. The article also provides findings from a survey conducted with employees to find out why turnover can be contagious.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: Network analysis showing clusters of turnover (Source: Philip Arkcoll)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Much of the research on engagement is traditionally focused on external drivers such as organisational culture, quality of leaders and role characteristics. However, as the authors explain in this fascinating article, a new study suggests that close to 50% of engagement can be predicted through individual personality with four traits highlighted: positive affect, proactivity, conscientiousness, and extroversion. Together, these traits represent some of the core ingredients of emotional intelligence and resilience. A must-read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcarty/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Carty</a>’s write-up of the recent CIPD HR Analytics conference focuses on the three principles of effective people analytics he saw emerge from the conference. The first principle of understanding the business is paramount to having success with people analytics. Michael always provides superb summaries of the key takeaways from conferences, and this is one of his best yet. Features insights and case study examples from speakers including: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/greigaitken/"" target=""_blank"">Greig Aitken</a> (RBS), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-mahon-49167645/"" target=""_blank"">Elaine Mahon</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-saunders/"" target=""_blank"">Kim Saunders</a> (both Office of National Statistics), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/communitymike/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Collins</a> (River Island), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a>. For more on the key takeaways from this conference you should also checkout <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Edward Houghton</a>’s write-up <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coming-from-cold-moving-people-analytics-niche-core-hr-houghton/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>, <p>As interest in and adoption of people analytics continues to rise, so the number of students choosing to research the field grows. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulvanderlaken/"" target=""_blank"">Paul van der Laken</a>’s dissertation is one such example and is based in part, on the time Paul spent at Shell where he helped quantify the impact of global mobility as an analyst in the HR Data &amp; Analytics department. The whole dissertation is worth a read, but <a href=""https://www.publicatie-online.nl/uploaded/flipbook/15810-v-d-laken/8/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">chapter 1</a> and <a href=""https://www.publicatie-online.nl/uploaded/flipbook/15810-v-d-laken/144/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">chapter 7</a> are especially recommended. This is where Paul reflects on the past and future of people analytics, discussing machine learning complications, ethical issues, CSR, new avenues, and many more. One of my favourite sections is where Paul outlines his analysis on the monthly Google search interest for several labels describing the field between 2004 and 2018 (see <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: Monthly Google search interest on “people analytics” and related terms over time. Values are proportional to the maximum value and fit by locally weighted regression lines (Source: Paul van der Laken) </em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Unilever is one of the companies leading the way when it comes to incorporating AI into HR. In this piece, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> describes how Unilever has partnered with Pymetrics to screen and assess 1.8m job applicants per year. As well as enhancing the candidate experience, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nairleena/"" target=""_blank"">Leena Nair</a> (Unilever’s CHRO) confirms that the automated system has saved 70,000 hours previously spent on interviewing and assessing candidates. The article also describes Unabot, a NLP based bot that supports onboarding by providing information to employees when asked and which has already been successfully rolled out in 36 of Unilever’s 190 markets.</p>, <p>Taking the recent story about Amazon’s experience with a <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">sexist recruiting engine</a> as his cue, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjcook/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Cook</a> provides three tips on how to use AI to neutralise – rather than perpetuate – bias to support your diversity and recruiting goals. His first tip on pointing the technology at the specific parts of the recruiting process where you are falling short of your diversity goals makes a whole lot of sense. Ian’s overarching message of how AI should serve, not rule, human decision-making is one I fully concur with.</p>, <p>With technology continuing to outpace regulation, companies forging ahead with AI must establish their own ethical frameworks. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenporttom/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Davenport</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-vic-katyal-482166/"" target=""_blank"">Vivek Katyal</a>’s article provides a set of recommendations including making ethics a board-level issue, taking a proactive approach to minimising bias, being transparent with customers and employees and recognising that AI works best with - rather than without – humans. Ethics will continue to be one of the most important and challenging aspects of people analytics, and it’s worth highlighting that the approach of establishing an ethical framework is one <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> has already undertaken with member companies in its People Analytics Program, as described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkpetersen1/"" target=""_blank"">Dirk Petersen</a> in <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/11/19/six-steps-to-ethically-sound-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">6 steps to ethically sound people analytics</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It’s prediction season so I thought it would be helpful to collect some of the data-themed prophecies. First up, my ten predictions all related to and stress the importance of the ‘Human Touch’. Then Tom Haak provides an inspiring set of trends for 2019, which as he admits makes him as much of a ‘trendwisher’ as a ‘trendwatcher’. I also enjoyed Rob Scott’s list of predictions as well as Kathi Enderes’ prediction that people analytics will augment the workforce and workplace. Bernard Marr makes his second entry on this month’s list with five predictions on where AI is headed in 2019 with #4 “<em>More jobs will be created by AI than will be lost to it</em>” resonating with the earlier article from Ravin Jesuthasan and John Boudreau. Finally, Anita Lettink has performed the monumental task of collecting all of the best HR predictions and trends into one easily digestible repository.</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick</a> has been an inspiration to many in our field with his once or twice a year articles centred around the evolution of people analytics and fact-based HR at ABN Amro. One of his most popular articles is Patrick’s 10 Golden Rules, which he first published in 2014, updated in 2015 and then created this ‘crowd’ version in 2016. All of the rules Patrick outlines resonate, but rules #2 (only do business relevant research), #3 (create actionable insights) and #7 (preach and teach to the HR community) are especially important.   </p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>Two must-listen to podcasts to close the year. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-pfeffer-57a01b6/"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Pfeffer</a> talks to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobsutton1/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Sutton</a> on the FRICTION Podcast about his superb book ‘Dying for a Paycheck,’ and issues a clarion call that rather than increasing working hours in an attempt to drive productivity growth, firms should instead give employees more autonomy.

David R. Green,"December 13, 2018",The Human Touch: 10 Predictions for HR in 2019,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-touch-10-predictions-hr-2019-david-green/,"[<p>It’s that time of year again when Santa is readying his sleigh, the familiar refrain of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwHyuraau4Q"" target=""_blank"">Fairytale of New York</a> rings out across the airwaves, mince pies are being consumed by the dozen and the crystal ball is dusted off to guide my predictions for HR in 2019.</p>, <p>Predicting the future is, to quote Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy author Douglas Adams, fundamentally “a mug’s game” but essential given the sheer velocity of change means that we are going to have to live in the future, “probably next week”.</p>, <p>Whilst I wouldn’t dare to predict the outcome of Brexit (and live in hope it won’t actually happen), and demure at any prophecy of Liverpool’s Premier League aspirations for the current season, I’m happy to wade in when it comes to HR. Witness my previous predictions for <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-first-what-key-hr-trends-2018-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2018</a>, 2017, 2016, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-predictions-hr-recruiting-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2015</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140731073723-12091643-ten-predictions-for-talent-acquisition-in-2014-half-term-report-2-of-2/"" target=""_blank"">2014</a>.</p>, <p>So, with a tin hat securely in place, tongue firmly in cheek and a belly full of mulled wine, it’s time to jump into the abyss…</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst AI will undoubtedly revolutionise both the way we work and also the work we actually do, the dystopian commentary on how machines will consign us to unemployment and drudgery is simply wrong. Clearly, we are in the midst of huge disruption and many routine and repetitive tasks will indeed be automated. However, research from the likes of Gartner, the World Economic Forum (see <strong><em>Fig 1</em></strong>) and McKinsey all conclude that AI will create more jobs than it will replace. The jobs generated by AI will allow us to be more creative, more impactful and more human. As such, the trend that weaves its way through all my 2019 predictions share (to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85cNRQo1m3A"" target=""_blank"">quote Bruce Springsteen</a>) “a little of that Human Touch”. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: The Jobs landscape in 2022 (Source: World Economic Forum)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>My lead prediction for 2018 will I believe, go into overdrive in 2019 as HR continues to take inspiration from marketing to create personalised experiences for employees. This is a radical shift from the ‘one size fits all’ HR programs of the past. But business needs, technological capability and the expectations of employees themselves means that this retrograde practice needs to be consigned to the wastebasket of history. Instead, personalising the ‘moments that matter’ on the employee journey and providing recommendations to support for example onboarding, learning and mobility not only benefits employees but also the organisation in terms of providing data to support strategy, workforce planning, retention - and business performance.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>2018 was a landmark year for people analytics as interest and adoption in the field accelerated. With a Corporate Research Forum study finding that 69% of large organisations now have a people analytics team, the chasm of adoption seems to have finally been crossed. The work of people analytics teams is increasingly equally focused on providing value to employees as well as driving better business outcomes. Whilst, organisations still face numerous challenges in <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/8/9/nine-dimensions-for-excellence-in-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">achieving sustained excellence in people analytics</a> – not least in imbuing data literacy in the wider HR function and HR business partner community, expect more adoption in 2019 in line with people analytics continuing to shift from the periphery to the core of HR strategy. The business benefits of investing in people analytics are becoming more obvious too, with a recent study by Visier finding that the profit margins of organisations with advanced capability in people analytics are 56% higher than those of their peers. That sounds like the perfect clarion call for data-driven HR to me.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: The rise in adoption and business value of people analytics (Sources: Corporate Research Forum and Visier) </em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Ethics is the most important aspect of people analytics and also the field’s biggest challenge. 2018 saw the Cambridge Analytica scandal, news on Amazon’s biased hiring algorithm and the introduction of the EU’s GDPR. The potential of people analytics is enormous but the risk of getting it wrong and losing employee trust – perhaps irrevocably – is high. All of those who work in the field have a responsibility to ensure that people data is used for good. Fortunately, with the growing trend of providing personalised recommendations and insights to employees in exchange for the personal data that they share with their employers, the field is moving in the right direction. Coupled with a surge in the employee wellness market, expect to see the growth in ‘personal analytics’, whereby workers are given data-driven insights to make better personal and work-related decisions to increase exponentially in 2019.   </p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>One of the best books I’ve read in 2018 was Jeffrey Pfeffer’s Dying for a Paycheck, which provided a sobering and damning analysis on how our workplaces are literally killing people. Not only do modern management practices engender stress, damage engagement and destroy the mental and physical health of employees, Pfeffer also emphasises the massive harm it causes company performance too. This is why the field of people analytics is so important as is the focus on employee experience and wellness. The methodologies being employed to understand, design and measure employee experience are getting more sophisticated, more data-driven and more wide-ranging. These include active and passive listening tools such as surveys, ONA and wearables plus the analysis of unstructured data (e.g. text) that in combination provide signals on how employees think, feel and behave. Expect to see growth in companies providing their employees with the tools, data and “nudges” to support exercise, mental health, work/life balance and consequently motivation, happiness – and performance.   </p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>As companies seek to gain insights into what drives individual, team and organisational performance and productivity, there is a growing focus on maximising the value of the organisation’s social capital – namely how individuals and teams are connected within the enterprise. This has seen a rapid growth in companies using Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) to map relationships, identify key influencers, highlight employees at risk of burnout, get insights on performance and support innovation amongst other uses (see <strong><em>Fig 3</em></strong>). The ONA vendor market (also see <strong><em>Fig 3</em></strong>) is booming and is set to gather pace in 2019 as more companies adopt ONA. For more on this topic, please see <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">The Role of ONA in People Analytics</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: Typical ONA use cases (left) and vendor market scan (right) (Source: David Green, The role of ONA in People Analytics)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of my predictions from last year, which with the emergence of Humu from stealth mode and other vendors developing tools in this area, I expect to really come to the fore in 2019. To recap, HR is once again playing catch up with marketing here as companies have long sought to understand and influence consumer behaviour. Whilst examples in HR are still in short supply, I know a number of people analytics teams experimenting in this area. One of these is Google (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1482&amp;v=07I2Np5UWAU"" target=""_blank"">watch Prasad Setty speaking here</a>) where much of the work undertaken by the people analytics team is on research to help educate Googlers on how they make decisions and they can improve these over time. Expect to hear more about companies researching the impact of behaviour on employees, teams and organisations in the next 12 months. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In a backstage conversation at UNLEASH, Josh Bersin revealed to me that he is currently tracking 1,400 HR tech companies globally. Investment in the space is rising in parallel with the hype and the choice facing buyers is daunting. With the pace of technological capability quickening, the digital transformation of HR and rising employee expectations, investment, innovation and confusion are all also set to increase. 2018 saw LinkedIn launch Talent Insights and acquire Glint, SAP spend $8 billion on Qualtrics, the emergence of Humu and the growth of an increasingly impressive glut of start-ups. Expect more innovation – and more consolidation in the space in 2019. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As companies seek to be more agile and prepare themselves for the challenges and opportunities offered through AI and automation, so the focus on workforce segmentation needs to shift from roles to skills. Indeed, as research from TI People finds (see <strong><em>Fig 4</em></strong>), segmentation by skill/skill set is set to triple in organisations by 2020. Becoming a skills-based organisation is a significant shift and will take time, so expect increased impetus from HR leaders, people analytics teams – and the vendor community in 2019. The whole area of skills will continue to have an increasing impact on workforce planning (skills for the future, workforce composition), learning (workers will require new skills in the workplace of the future) and talent acquisition (nurturing of talent pools, hiring new skills, site location etc) as well as company M&amp;A strategy.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: Workforce segmentation today and in 2020 (Source TI People)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>HR is one of the most exciting areas to work in the business. This is partly due to the function facing perhaps unprecedented change and increased expectations on the value and impact it needs to provide to the business – and employees. As such, the skills and capabilities required by HR professionals are also undergoing seismic change. I’ve partnered recently with <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">myHRfuture</a> on a survey to understand what these skills are, and also which ones are most in demand from HR professionals themselves. <strong><em>Fig 5</em></strong> provides an illustration of these skills. With the traditional HR professional bodies struggling to incorporate these requirements into their certification programs, expect to see the rise of alternative providers (like myHRfuture) to fulfil this growing demand.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: What are the HR skills of the future (Source: myHRfuture)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>That’s the ten predictions for 2019 done, which just leaves me to wish you all a Merry Christmas and a prosperous data-driven, employee-focused (and Brexit-free?) 2019.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You might also want to read Anita Lettink’s extremely helpful collection of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ultimate-list-2019-hr-trends-anita-lettink/"" target=""_blank"">The Ultimate List of 2019 Trends</a> and if I could pick out one especially to read, it would be Tom Haak’s <a href=""https://hrtrendinstitute.com/2018/11/26/10-inspiring-hr-trends-for-2019/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">10 inspiring HR Trends for 2019</a>.</p>, <p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>I'm delighted to have contributed a cameo role to a new online course on myHRfuture, which was launched this week and covers <strong>'Creating a Digital HR Foundation'</strong>.

My first major conference is the People Analytics &amp; Future of Work Conference in San Francisco (<a href=""https://pafow.com/pafow19/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW</a>) on 31st January and 1st February, which I’ll once again be co-chairing with Al Adamsen along with a stellar list of speakers.

Enjoy and if you do, please do share with your network.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Despite the significant growth in adoption of people analytics, many people professionals still lack the confidence and skills to make the most of their workforce data. As the preamble to the latest in a growing number of superb resources from the CIPD on people analytics explains, this guide is designed to help all people professionals of any level learn the basics and improve their confidence and capability when using data. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68/"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Ed Houghton</a> have produced an excellent primer and, as <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> demonstrates, also contributed to the debate on whether the field should be called HR, Workforce or People Analytics. As one who prefers the latter, this image is particularly pleasing.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: Scope of People Analytics (Source: Workforce Dimensions, CIPD)</em></strong> </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>How should you run a people analytics project to maximise the opportunity for success? In this excellent guide, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> outlines the Eight Step Model for Purposeful Analytics (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>) Nigel Guenole, Sheri Feinzig and he developed for the landmark <a href=""https://www.thepowerofpeople.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">'The Power of People</a>' book. A summary of each step is provided with perhaps the key message being each project always starting with a clearly defined business question.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: The Eight Step model for purposeful analytics (Source: The Power of People by Nigel Guenole, Jonathan Ferrar and Sheri Feinzig)</em></strong></p>, <p>What is the secret of a good HR dashboard? That is the question pondered by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman/"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a> in his article. He argues that instead of continually falling into the trap of redefining the right metrics, tirelessly cleaning data and inventing new visualisations we should instead base our dashboards on questions. Creelman goes on to provide an example (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>) emphasising the need to compose your dashboard with the right questions, as a precursor to then using data to provide answers.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: Example of a HR dashboard composed of questions (Source: David Creelman and Peter Navin - The CMO of People: Manage Employees Like Customers With an Immersive Predictable Experience That Drives Productivity and Performance)</em></strong></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> shares my view that the majority of maturity models for people analytics are incomplete as they mostly focus on techniques rather than far more important aspects such as business outcomes. The model Thomas presents in this article is much more rooted in reality (see <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong>) as the happy toddlers become grumpy teenagers before making the final transition to a mature people analytics team.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: People Analytics Maturity (Source: Thomas Rasmussen)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The role of the people analytics leader is absolutely pivotal to the success - or otherwise – of creating, building and sustaining people analytics within an organisation. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin/"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a>’s analysis draws out the unique set of skills required to thrive in this pioneering and challenging role, the reporting line (ideally direct to the CHRO), how to harness technology, drive change and create value.</p>, <p>Fascinating analysis by McKinsey on the evolution of the Chief Analytics Officer role over time and how the dominant required persona of the 'Catalyst' has now emerged (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>). The article is a must-read for any Head of People Analytics as the opportunities and challenges outlined are very similar. The authors explain that the ‘Catalyst’ helps redefine the leadership role for adopting analytics and AI at scale. Five key areas where Catalysts lead the charge and facilitate change are outlined including the need to act as an agent of change to navigate organisational barriers to analytics adoption.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: The evolution of the role of Chief Analytics Officer (Source: McKinsey)</em></strong></p>, <p>People analytics leader <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-mahon-49167645/"" target=""_blank"">Elaine Mahon</a> describes how she is delivering positive change at the Office for National Statistics through four key activities with the easy to remember ABCD acronym. These are: Adopt an <strong>A</strong>gile approach, <strong>B</strong>uild senior level engagement, <strong>C</strong>reate tangible actions and <strong>D</strong>eploy the right skills. An inspiring read and it's good to see people analytics thriving in the public sector.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Earlier this year, <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> (where I am a board advisor) worked with 15 Global500 member companies to co-create an ethics charter and guiding set of principles for the use of people data (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong>). <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkpetersen1/"" target=""_blank"">Dirk Petersen</a>’s article describes the background and delivery of the project and six recommendations to help firms develop ethically sound people analytics. These include the need to i) align key stakeholders, and ii) demonstrate employee value. As Dirk concludes, getting management to take data ethics seriously is paramount to avoid a potentially fatal ‘Cambridge Analytica’ moment.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 6: People Analytics Ethics Decision Model (Source: Insight222)  </em></strong></p>, <p>For more on ethics, trust and people analytics for good, please check out the latest edition of Data Driven HR <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/zandel/data-driven-hr-7-nov-ethics-trust-people-data-244737"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, which collects together a wealth of resources on this most critical of topics.

Methodologies are outlined to drive excellence in both CX and EX encompassing strategy, design, measurement, adoption and culture. An example of employee journey mapping as undertaken by Frank and his team at ABN Amro is highlighted in <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong> below.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8: Employee Experience Journey Canvas at ABN Amro (Source: Frank Van Den Brink)</em></strong></p>, <p>2017’s excellent <a href=""http://marketing.bersin.com/rs/976-LMP-699/images/Infographic-HIPAN-TopFindings.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">High-Impact People Analytics</a> study by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a> for Bersin by Deloitte found that the biggest predictor of success in people analytics was the development of an organisational culture for data-driven decision making. A key element of this is to improve the data literacy of HR professionals. I featured a number of articles on this theme in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-october-2018-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">my October collection</a> and here are two more to digest. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drtomaschamorro/"" target=""_blank"">Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic</a> outlines three ways to build a data-driven team emphasising the need to foster critical thinking allied to training and hiring for the right skills. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomredman/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Redman</a> explains the need to think like a data scientist as one of his five concepts to helping your team be more data-driven.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A couple of articles for the more technically-minded. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hendrikfeddersen/"" target=""_blank"">Hendrik Feddersen</a> argues that partly due to the limitations of Excel in handling large amounts of data, budding HR analysts should instead learn how to use R, offering a number of compelling reasons why he believes this to be the case. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> examines the lack of use of control groups and regression to the mean in people analytics and how this threatens to undermine the evidence of business value created by the field. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The ‘classic article’ this month is actually a two-part piece by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a>, which presents the case for and the case against people analytics being under the auspices of the HR department. The articles provoked a healthy discussion four years ago, and the question of where the people analytics function should sit is a debate that continues to rage today. Which side of the fence do you fall down upon? Is people analytics stymied within the HR organisation or will its potential be unfulfilled if it is located within a group function focused on consumer analytics?

David R. Green,"November 5, 2018",The best HR & People Analytics articles of October 2018,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-october-2018-david-green/,"[<p>October proved to be another bumper month for the field of people analytics, with the personal highlight for me being my fireside chat with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a> on the main stage at UNLEASH where we discussed ‘The Moral Imperative of People Analytics’.</p>, <p>UNLEASH confirmed that people analytics is now a core component of strategic thinking around the future of the workforce and the HR organisation needed to support it. This can also be seen in the articles I’ve selected this month, which cover areas such as creating a data-driven culture, the role of the CHRO, the rise of organisational network analysis, the shift from HR strategies focused on people management to ones based on skills, the continued evolution of the employee engagement market, and a special selection of articles on algorithmic fairness in wake of the recent news that Amazon binned a hiring algorithm that was perpetuating bias against women. </p>, <p>Thanks to Amit for his wise words and to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/leah-narodetsky-1299a095/"" target=""_blank"">Leah Narodetsky</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marccoleman/"" target=""_blank"">Marc Coleman</a> and the <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> team for making it happen and also for the opportunity to MC the main stage at what proved to be the biggest and best UNLEASH show yet.</p>, <p><em>TALKING ABOUT THE MORAL IMPERATIVE OF PEOPLE ANALYTICS WITH AMIT MOHINDRA AT UNLEASH IN AMSTERDAM</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Please note that the articles selected are ordered by topic, so on with the show...</p>, <p>Creating a culture of analytics within the wider HR function is a critical step in achieving sustainable capability in people analytics. This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> is invaluable in this regard. First, the authors provides a smart categorisation of HR professionals that are analytically savvy, willing or resistant. Then their article describes ways you can hire for and/or develop analytical capability. With people analytics now becoming table stakes, this is a very timely read.</p>, <p><em>FIG 1: THREE CATEGORIES OF HR PROFESSIONALS AND THEIR ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES</em></p>, <p>A really helpful and practical guide to five key barriers that inhibit the progress of people analytics and the creation of a data-driven HR function. The article which describes barriers such as a lack of trust in data, an inability for companies to focus on solving real business problems and the very real risk of misunderstanding the basics of data. The advice offered by contributors to the article – particularly <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a> but also <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhousman/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Housman</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/danstaleyhr/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Staley</a> provide a good guide to organisations seeking to overcome these obstacles.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Only 11% of business leaders trust HR to use data to anticipate and help them fill their talent needs. That's the worrying finding in the 2018 DDI, Conference Board and EY Global Leadership Survey featured in this article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar/"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccalearay/"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca Ray</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-canwell/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Canwell</a>. The authors offer four steps for HR leaders to improve their data literacy as illustrated in Figure 2 below.</p>, <p><em>FIG 2: FOUR STEPS FOR HR LEADERS TO IMPROVE THEIR DATA LITERACY</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article from the November-December issue of HBR, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-leonardi-45b67321/"" target=""_blank"">Paul Leonardi</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/noshcontractor/"" target=""_blank"">Noshir Contractor</a> state that most people analytics teams rely on a narrow approach restricted to data on individuals. They argue that if the field is going to live up to the hype, people analytics teams need to also explore data on the interplay between people to understand how they interact, who has influence, what fosters innovation etc. The result is one of the best articles I've read yet on the case for passive organisational network analysis (or as the authors describe it in the article – ‘relational analytics’). The Six Signatures of Relational Analytics that is presented (see <em>Figure 3</em>) covering Ideation, Influence, Efficiency, Innovation, Silos and Vulnerability is a powerful starting point for people analytics teams looking to mine the digital exhaust of their workforce. The future’s bright, the future’s ONA. For more on ONA including several case studies, please read my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><em>The Role of ONA in People Analytics</em></a> primer. You also might want to read <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-study-accelerating-multibillion-dollar-telecom-merger-mar%C3%ADn/"" target=""_blank"">this case study</a> from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscomarinruz/"" target=""_blank"">Francisco Marin</a> on how ONA helped accelerate a multi-million dollar merger of two telecom companies in Europe.</p>, <p><em>FIG 3: THE SIX SIGNATURES OF RELATIONAL ANALYTICS (SOURCE: PAUL LEONARDI AND NOSHIR CONTRACTOR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the not too distant future I believe that the GDPR will be seen as a positive for people analytics as it should help curtail projects that are simply 'creepy'. For that to happen, HR must take ownership of GDPR, embrace the new responsibilities and use the legislation to add value to the business. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/spherehr-spheredp/"" target=""_blank"">Kim Bradford</a> is not only an expert on the GDPR but is also a HR practitioner, and her article offers practical guidance for HR on how they can seize the opportunity offered through GDPR. Her message that ""<em>HR is an ideal business partner for implementing GDPR compliance within businesses</em>"" certainly resonates. Kim has recently launched a course on GDPR for HR professionals over on myHRfuture. Click <a href=""https://academy.myhrfuture.com/p/introduction-to-gdpr-for-hr"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> to find out more.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A superb guide from data scientist <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-richmond/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Richmond</a>, who founded the people analytics team at WeWork, on how to predict employee turnover Using R. I frequently get asked for practical guides such as this, and Brian's article is detailed, well-written and highly educational. As Brian writes, employee turnover is a challenge for many organisations, so this is likely to be an indispensable resource for many budding people analysts.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong><em>: TERMINATIONS BY REASON AND DEPARTMENT (SOURCE: BRIAN RICHMOND)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This McKinsey study provides a broad view on the opportunities and challenges presented by the new age of artificial intelligence. One of the six focus areas investigated zeroes in on the profound impact AI and automation will have on the world of work (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below). The key takeaway from the study from a people perspective is that workers will need different skills to thrive in the workplace of the future.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>AUTOMATION WILL HAVE A FAR-REACHING EFFECT ON THE GLOBAL WORKFORCE (SOURCE: MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Josh’s second entry on the countdown this month plots a course through the history of the employee engagement market. He argues that with the launch of Humu – which Josh refers to as the first behavioural company in our space – the engagement market has reached a third major evolution (see <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong>) that could even see disruptors like Culture Amp, Glint (now owned of course by LinkedIn) and Peakon being disrupted themselves by Humu and other players that will doubtless enter this market. An absolute must-read.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8</em></strong><em> – THE EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT MARKET EVOLVES (SOURCE: JOSH BERSIN)</em></p>, <p>Just as digital technology has transformed the customer experience so is it now entering the workplace in the form of the consumerisation of HR. In his article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumyasanto/"" target=""_blank"">Soumyasanto Sen</a> outlines how companies are redesigning HR to provide positive touchpoints at every stage of the employee lifecycle. He emphasises the need to balance automation in some interactions with the desire from employees to have more human interaction in other HR-related tasks (see <strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong>). This blend of digital and human is perhaps best encapsulated in the evolution of how organisations are developing employee experience with technology enabling the personalisation of HR services to its workforce.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 9</em></strong><em> – THE GROWING DIGITAL AND HUMAN INTERACTIONS AT WORK (SOURCE: SOUMYASANTO SEN, BASED ON PWC)</em></p>, <p>A new addition to this column, which recognises that there have been so many wonderful articles written previously about people analytics. We start with one of the best articles ever written on the field…</p>, <p>This seminal paper provides a critique of the HR centric approach adopted by many organisations when it comes to analytics, instead advocating an “outside-in” method targeted at solving real business problems. Two excellent examples from Maersk Drilling are highlighted to support the argument. Case 1 examines the impact of leadership quality and crew competence on safety, operational performance, and customer satisfaction (see <strong><em>Figure 10</em></strong>) whilst Case 2 examines the ROI and Strategic Impact of a Technical Trainee Acceleration Program. Both cases show that analytics is far more effective when tackled from a business (rather than an inward-looking HR) perspective and that analytics needs to be treated as a change management process. The guidance offered by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> in this article is still highly relevant to the state of people analytics today.</p>, <p>I had the pleasure of interviewing <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosa-lee-33307a14/"" target=""_blank"">Rosa Lee</a> at the recent <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> Global Executive Retreat in Philadelphia about her experience of developing people analytics at Bosch, and of taking that critical step to build a data-driven culture in HR.

David R. Green,"October 18, 2018",New LinkedIn and Humu products show surge in people analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-linkedin-humu-products-show-surge-people-analytics-david-green/,"[<p>For someone like me who has been involved in the space for over five years, last week was the strongest signal yet that we reached a tipping point with people analytics.</p>, <p>Amidst much fanfare, LinkedIn made a series of announcements immediately before and during its flagship <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/events/talent-connect/all-access#all"" target=""_blank"">Talent Connect</a> show. As well as confirming the acquisition of Glint, LinkedIn also announced the launch of a series of data driven products including its own Talent Hub ATS the long awaited Talent Insights.</p>, <p>Last week also marked the emergence from stealth mode of former Google Chief People Officer <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock/"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a>’s new start-up <a href=""https://humu.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humu</a>, with the launch of its long anticipated Nudge Engine and the promise to blend ‘<em>science, machine learning, and a little love</em>’.</p>, <p>This article will focus on the new product offerings from LinkedIn and Humu, but before that it’s worth highlighting recent research that substantiates the growth of people analytics and explains why LinkedIn in particular is investing so much into this space.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>During the course of 2018, LinkedIn has published three regional versions of its research study into the growth of people analytics, The Rise of Analytics in HR. All three reports – for <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/cx/2018/pdf/full-report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">APAC</a>, <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/talent-intelligence/workforce/pdfs/NAMER---Rise-of-Analytics-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">North America</a> and <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/talent-intelligence/workforce-intelligence?tid=EMEA"" target=""_blank"">EMEA</a> – confirm that the number of HR professionals on LinkedIn who cite analytics as a skill is rising significantly (see <strong><em>Figure 1 </em></strong>below)</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1: </em></strong><em>The increase in HR professionals with analytics skills in their LinkedIn profiles is rising globally (Source: David Green, created from data in LinkedIn's The Rise of Analytics in HR research)</em></p>, <p>Each report also provides a fascinating insight into the countries (or cities in the case of the North American report) and sectors that are leading the charge, as well as the top use cases for people analytics (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below for example from the North American report).</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2: </em></strong><em>Top cities and use cases for HR Analytics in North America (Source: LinkedIn, The Rise of Analytics in HR)</em></p>, <p>One of the reasons why this research is so fascinating is that the insights were derived from the LinkedIn profiles of people analytics professionals. This may explain the low ranking for ‘Retention’ as a use case (the same also applied in the EMEA research). I’d like to think that this was an indicator of the growing maturity of people analytics, and that companies have moved on from the common initial use case of predicting attrition but suspect that it can more likely be attributed to the lack of ‘glamour’ associated with the topic of retention.</p>, <p>The key finding in LinkedIn’s research of the rise of analytics within HR echoes those found in other recent studies from the likes of the CIPD, Corporate Research Forum, Visier and Bersin by Deloitte. My recent <a href=""https://us18.campaign-archive.com/?u=e0b52874f211caf2aa39d4929&amp;id=783cdf9081"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘Research Special’</a> of Data Driven HR collated some of the best research, but two findings that illustrate the growth in people analytics and the business reason for doing so are:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The continued rise in adoption of the use of data in HR and the shift of analytics from the periphery to the core of HR strategy is also evidenced in the broadening and deepening of the work people analytics teams are undertaking.</p>, <p>This was all too evident at the <a href=""https://pafow.com/pafow18east/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work</a> conference (PAFOW), I had the pleasure of co-chairing with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> in Philadelphia at the beginning of October.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As Josh Bersin writes in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-announces-lot-josh-bersin/"" target=""_blank"">his typically superb analysis</a>, LinkedIn is now unquestionably a powerhouse in the talent solutions market, with offerings covering recruiting, learning, engagement and performance management. When you factor in parent company Microsoft, the combination of LinkedIn and Microsoft will have the more traditional HR technology giants quaking in their boots.</p>, <p>The acquisition of <a href=""https://www.glintinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glint</a> is a masterstroke. The employee engagement market has shifted significantly away from traditional consulting led survey providers to technology enabled tools that have analytics at their heart. Along with the likes of Culture Amp and Peakon, Glint has been one of the vendors leading the way – and their growth has been remarkable.</p>, <p>What makes the Glint acquisition so shrewd is that it will enable LinkedIn to combine Glint’s internal view of what drives engagement within companies with LinkedIn’s unique data set on the wider workforce. This acquisition offers the potential for LinkedIn to use the insights gleaned from Glint’s engagement and performance management tools to personalise feedback to managers and also LinkedIn learning programs.     </p>, <p>I’m really excited about the introduction of Talent Insights, which I see as a unique and powerful tool to support recruiting, workforce planning and site location strategy.</p>, <p>I’ve seen at first-hand the excitement that Talent Insights has generated with HR and recruitment leaders having been fortunate to speak at the Talent Intelligence Experience events in Paris and Sydney over the summer.</p>, <p>LinkedIn used these events in part to demonstrate the power of Talent Insights by using examples from pilot customers like Atlassian (see <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/case-studies/talent-insights/atlassian"" target=""_blank"">Case Study</a> in <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below) to show how the product can provide accurate views of labour market trends and answer complex questions in minutes.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong><em>: Atlassian Talent Insights Case Study</em></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericowski/"" target=""_blank"">Eric Owski</a>’s article <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/product-updates/2018/linkedin-talent-insights-now-available"" target=""_blank"">here</a> provides more detail, but the power of Talent Insights to provide answers to questions such as - Where is the best location for us to open a new office or base a new team? Which companies am I losing talent to? Which competitors should I target to hire new talent from? – is a good reason why the recruiting leaders I spoke to in Sydney and Paris couldn’t wait to get their hands on the product.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong><em> – Example of Competitive Intelligence report on Talent Insights (Source: LinkedIn)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If the swell of new products from LinkedIn wasn’t enough, Humu finally emerged out of stealth mode after an incubation period that reminded me of the wait for the second Stone Roses album.</p>, <p>From the detail provided by Laszlo Bock confirming the launch, just like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJNbijG2M7Oyp4dKE3TIDjoV8wuSKgGo5"" target=""_blank"">The Second Coming</a>, Humu’s Nudge Engine appears to have been well worth the wait.</p>, <p>As the name implies, the Nudge Engine is a behavioural science product that draws on the work of the likes of Professor Richard Thaler, with the premise being that micro-interventions or ‘nudges’ have a significant and long-term effect on human behaviour and decision-making.</p>, <p>In his <a href=""https://humu.com/2018/10/08/humu-nudge-engine-make-work-better/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">article</a>, Laszlo describes how the Nudge Engine is designed to deploy thousands of customised nudges throughout the organisation to empower every employee, manager, team and leader as a change agent. He goes on to explain how that over time the engine learns about the timing, messaging and motivational techniques that ultimately inspire individual employees to take action. Humu’s mission is to make work better, for everyone and through this product, Humu believes its customers will be able to make the small incremental steps required to build happier, more capable and more successful organisations from the inside out and bottom up.</p>, <p>There has been a lot of excitement about Humu, partly because of Laszlo and fellow co-founders and ex-Googlers Wayne Crosby and Jessie Wisdom’s involvement, but also because of the scale of what they are attempting to achieve. If people analytics has one aim, surely it should be to build better organisations that make work better for employees at the same time as achieving improved business performance.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The launch of products like LinkedIn Talent Insights and Humu’s Nudge Engine are good for the field. The potential of people analytics is enormous, and the burgeoning vendor space coupled with the ambition of people analytics leaders I regularly meet with augers well for the future.</p>, <p>Are we ‘there’ yet? No, people analytics teams are still striving to grow their impact, create more value and improve focus (which inspired <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> and me to create the <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/8/9/nine-dimensions-for-excellence-in-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</em></a> model). Critically, many organisations still face challenges around improving the data literacy of the wider HR function, and certainly the debate around ethics and data privacy is set to top the agenda for the foreseeable future.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, there can be little doubt now that the practice of people analytics is here to stay, and the promise of a data driven HR function no longer resembles a pipe dream.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As mentioned in the article, I spoke at and attended LinkedIn’s Talent Intelligence Experience shows in Paris and Sydney earlier this year. I’d like to thank Carole Zibi, Ryan Batty and the team in EMEA as well as Sarah Husbands, Jason Laufer and the team in Sydney for looking after me. Both shows were amazing.</p>, <p>Thanks also to Eric Owski, Sarah O’Brien, Kate Hastings and team for letting me have an early view of Talent Insights, and also Laura Collins for getting me involved with the EMEA version of The Rise of Analytics in HR.</p>, <p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>I’m delighted to offer a 25% discount on the first three courses launched on <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">myHRfuture</a>.

I’ll be publishing something about the conference shortly, but for now do check out <a href=""https://bunch.ai/blog/people-analytics-trends-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this excellent writeup of PAFOW highlights</a> from Darja Gutnick.</p>, <p>Then two huge announcements this week confirmed that the people analytics field is accelerating faster than Lewis Hamilton is away from Sebastian Vettel's forlorn Ferrari in this year's Formula One World Championship. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-glint-helping-talent-leaders-build-winning-teams-shapero/"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn announced the acquisition of Glint</a> and then Laszlo Bock announced <a href=""https://humu.com/2018/10/08/humu-nudge-engine-make-work-better/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the official launch of Humu</a>, whose eagerly awaited Nudge Engine promises a blend of 'science, machine learning, and a little love'.</p>, <p>The main draw for the rest of October is the <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/amsterdam"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH World Conference</a> in Amsterdam on 23-24th October. If you haven’t been to an UNLEASH event before, I can promise you won’t be disappointed. If you have, well this year’s show is shaping up to be the best yet. If you are going, I look forward to seeing you there.</p>, <p>Now, without further ado let’s proceed to this month’s countdown:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>We start with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a>, who kicked off Insight222’s Global Executive Retreat with a mesmerising overview of the multiple opportunities advances in technology and real-time data collection offers to the people analytics discipline. Ben focused much of his time on privacy and ethics, drawing from what is arguably the definitive article written to date on this absolutely critical subject. After outlining examples of how these technologies are, for example, helping reduce gender bias, fatigue and attrition, Ben walks through a playbook for the ethical and smart use of employee data (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>). As Ben concludes, the potential of people analytics to improve decision making is astounding, but failure by organisations to protect employee data could erode this potential for good.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: A Playbook for the ethical, smart use of employee data (Source: created by David Green from Ben Waber's 'The Happy Tracked Employee' article in HBR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Earlier this year, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> and I mulled over the three key questions we regularly get asked by people analytics leaders: How can I improve my impact? How can I create more value? What should I focus on? This formed the basis for our <em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</em> model, which we created in the weeks following our discussion, and is now being used by several organisations to help evaluate, focus and prioritise their people analytics strategies. Jonathan’s article outlines each of the nine dimensions, which we grouped in three categories: foundational aspects (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>), resources and value. If you are a people analytics leader who wants to find out more, please <a href=""http://mailto:david.green@insight222.com?subject=RE:%20Nine%20Dimensions%20for%20Excellence%20in%20People%20Analytics%20model%20|%20Best%20People%20Analytics%20Articles%20for%20September"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">get in touch</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: The Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics - Foundation (Source: Jonathan Ferrar, David Green, Insight222)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> is leading the charge for Organisational Network Analysis from a practitioner perspective in his work as Chief Talent Officer at GM and through his terrific recent book <a href=""https://www.adaptivespace.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Adaptive Space</em></a>. In this article, Michael contests that whilst human capital is undoubtedly a firm’s greatest asset, bringing <u>in</u> the best people is only part of the solution, and that organisations must also bring <u>out</u> the best in people. To do this entails a new frontier, unleashing social capital potential. Michael then outlines two primary aspects of social capital —group cohesion and brokerage— that are particularly relevant to future HR practices. For more on ONA including several case studies, please read my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><em>The Role of ONA in People Analytics</em></a> primer.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>’s latest analysis of the people analytics field is as usual stacked full of golden nuggets and helpful tips. The article covers amongst other things: i) the latest people analytics technologies such as LinkedIn's new Talent Insights product (see later) plus others from Visier and ADP, ii) research on the top drivers of people analytics maturity (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>), iii) the importance of creating data literacy amongst HRBPs and the wider HR population, and; iv) analysis on where the market is headed as well as several case studies. As ever with anything Josh publishes, it's an absolute must-read.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong><em>: The top drivers of People Analytics maturity (Source: Josh Bersin, Bersin by Deloitte High-Impact People Analytics study)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I believe that the key responsibility of business leaders and HR is to be the custodians of employee well-being. In this respect, people analytics can be a force for good as it can not only shine a light on good or bad practice, but it can be used to finally prove the link between wellbeing and business performance. In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-pfeffer-57a01b6/"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Pfeffer</a> examines two typically overlooked essential areas of employee well-being: job control (the amount of discretion employees have to determine what they do and how they do it) and social support (family and friends you can count on, as well as close relationships). Just like Pfeffer’s recently published book, <a href=""http://mailto:https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dying-Paycheck-Jeffrey-Pfeffer/dp/0062800922"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Dying for a Paycheck</em></a>, it is a powerful and sobering read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>With the news that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-glint-helping-talent-leaders-build-winning-teams-shapero/"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn has acquired Glint</a>, the market for employee listening has never been so hot and has extended well beyond the traditional survey field. This is captured perfectly in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-silverman-33a6177/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Silverman</a>’s landscape of the employee listening technology space (see <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong>). Michael has done a superb job of capturing the vast majority of leading players in this space and the way he has split these into categories such as Text Analytics, ONA, Innovation as well as Survey technologies is extremely helpful.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong><em>: The Employee Listening Technology Landscape 2018 (Source: Michael Silverman, Silverman Research)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>To read the rest of the countdown for September, please <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/10/10/the-best-hr-amp-people-analytics-articles-of-september-2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>head over to myHRfuture</strong></a>, where you can also read articles by: Peter Hinssen, Laura Stevens, a collaboration between Alexis Fink and Keith McNulty, Francesca Gino, LinkedIn Talent Solutions research featuring David White and Chris Louie, Fredrik Johnsson, Stacey Harris and Erin Spencer, John Sumser, Andrew Spence, Stacia Shermann Garr and the World Economic Forum.

You can head over there to read: <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/8/7/the-best-hr-people-analytics-articles-of-july-2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The best HR &amp; People Analytics articles of July 2018</a> and <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/9/5/the-best-hr-people-analytics-articles-of-august-2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The best HR &amp; People Analytics article of August 2018</a>. A selection of 11 articles featured across these two retrospectives is provided here.</p>, <p>myHRfuture is also home to my new course 'An Introduction to People Analytics', which I put together with Jonathan Ferrar. Click on <a href=""https://academy.myhrfuture.com/p/introduction-to-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this link</a> or the image below to find out more.</p>, <p>As promised, here is a selection of 11 articles, which caught my attention over the summer:</p>, <p>There’s been a glut of excellent studies this year on the state of the people analytics field, which you can find collated in my recent <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/42fe334aec65/data-driven-hr-newsletter-issue-4-aug-155097"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Data Driven HR Newsletter</a>. Visier’s The Age of People Analytics Report is a valuable addition to the collection. You can download the full report <a href=""https://hello.visier.com/resources_research-reports_age-of-people-analytics.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, but first checkout the main findings in this insightful piece by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin/"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a>, who led the research. The three things Lexy highlights are telling: i) profit margins of organisations with advanced people analytics capability are 56% higher than those of less advanced, ii) building an organisation-wide data-driven culture is critical, and iii) most projects are still focused on HR effectiveness rather than business outcomes. The full report has tons of additional insights, not least the gem that is <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below, which highlights the size of people analytics teams by organisation size and analytics maturity.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 1: SIZE OF PEOPLE ANALYTICS TEAMS BY MATURITY AND ORGANISATION SIZE (SOURCE: VISIER)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the biggest focus areas for HR leaders continues to be the need to understand and improve employee experience. People analytics teams are increasingly at the forefront of efforts to analyse, design and personalise compelling work experiences across the employee lifecycle. As such, the maturity model outlined by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> in this brilliant article (see also <em>Figure 2</em>) will undoubtedly assist many organisations in this effort. Look out for the examples provided on the ‘Moments that Matter’ in the employee journey. This is an approach and model that Volker and his team at <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TI People</a> have created together with over 20 member companies including the likes of BMW, Bosch, Cisco, Roche and Zalando.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 2: A MATURITY MODEL FOR EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE (SOURCE: VOLKER JACOBS, TI PEOPLE)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>When I speak to HR leaders about people analytics one of the most common challenges I hear is that of how to enable the wider HR function and particularly HR business partners. This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, which draws on her research at Bersin by Deloitte, covers this critical area and clearly sets out the importance of improving the data literacy of HR professionals. As Madhura describes (and as illustrated in <em>Figure 3</em> below), the companies that develop advanced and sustainable capability in people analytics are those that focus on creating a culture of data-based decision making beyond that of the people analytics team itself.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 3: PERCENTAGE OF ORGANIZATIONS REPORTING BASIC DATA LITERACY SKILLS BY MATURITY LEVEL AND FUNCTION (SOURCE: MADHURA CHAKRABARTI, BERSIN BY DELOITTE)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The HR function is transforming – whether it is the need to become more data driven, be more agile and ultimately increase its impact in the business. This means the HR operating model itself and the skills HR practitioners need to possess both have to adapt to this new reality. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> examines the former in his article with the overriding premise being that upgrades to the HR operating model should focus more on improving relationships within and outside the department as opposed to redefining roles based on organisation charts. In the second article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> defines design thinking and how it can be applied in the HR space particularly with regards to creating and personalising the employee experience.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/didierelzinga/"" target=""_blank"">Didier Elzinga</a>, CEO of Culture Amp, kindly references my recent <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dont-forget-h-hr-ethics-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Ethics in People Analytics</a> article, as part of his clarion call that the way organisations collect and use data must fundamentally change. Ethics is arguably our biggest challenge and also the most important aspect of people analytics. As Didier writes, our responsibility as people analysts is to help our customers in the business (leaders, managers, employees – and HR) interpret and ethically use the data and insights we're giving them.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This is a beautifully written piece by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a>, one of the foremost people analytics leaders on the planet and who until recently led the people analytics team at Apple. As Amit states at the outset ""<em>people analytics leaders are in the business of change management</em>"". He then proceeds to outline a clear vision on how this can be achieved drawing a clever parallel with his boyhood poem of choice “Where the Mind is Without Fear”.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Another case study, where <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> describes how one of the world's largest FMCG companies worked with <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> to harness passive ONA data in order to measure the Social Capital of the participants of its leadership development program. The results Greg outlines are significant, not least that as a direct result there was a 40% improvement in the collaboration of the teams whose leaders were involved in the program. ONA continues to be a huge area of interest for people analytics team and this case study offers a practical example of the unique insights and outcomes ONA can provide.  </p>, <p><em>FIGURE 4: TOP LEADERS ARE CENTRAL TO THEIR TEAM'S NETWORK (SOURCE: GREG NEWMAN, TRUSTSPHERE)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> writes, most large organisations have vast amounts of employee text feedback that thus far they’ve done very little with (<em>Figure 5</em> below provides some examples of the types of questions that can be answered with open-question employee text feedback). Given that this data is invariably the most valuable part of a questionnaire or survey, it is not surprising that many people analytics teams are looking to explore these potential gold mines. Andrew is one of the leading proponents of text analytics and this article describes how to code or categorise employee feedback. The section on the difference between deductive and inductive coding is particularly illuminating even for this lay writer. For those that haven’t already subscribed to Andrew’s weekly <a href=""http://www.empiricalhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empirical HR newsletter</a>, I strongly recommend you do.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 5: EXAMPLES OF QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ANSWERED WITH EMPLOYEE TEXT FEEDBACK (SOURCE: ANDREW MARRITT)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this terrific four-part series for HR Zone – the first three articles of which have already been published, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> outlines his model of Scientific People Analytics (SPA), and the many benefits it brings to businesses. Part 1 provides the rationale behind the methodology. Part 2 explains why SPA is useful for supporting human capital decisions made by organisational managers, and Part 3 presents a methodology for deploying scientific people analytics – see <em>Figure 6</em> below.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 6: METHODOLOGY FOR DEPLOYING SCIENTIFIC PEOPLE ANALYTICS (SOURCE: MAX BLUMBERG)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Case studies help bring analytics to life and this article provides a perfect example. It describes how LinkedIn’s People Analytics team supported the business in formulating a geolocation strategy for its tech talent. Key insights covered include i) the cross-functional approach that was adopted and which saw the team work in tandem with the HRBP for Engineering, Head of Talent Acquisition and Head of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, ii) the focus on the 'why' and building a framework to support the 'why' and; iii) the emphasis on identifying and then answering the critical four questions that were identified for the initiative in <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong> below.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 7: GTO TALENT INSIGHTS GEOLOCATION STRATEGY FRAMEWORK (SOURCE: SHUJAAT AHMAD, KATIE SITTLER, LINKEDIN) </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>People Analytics is increasingly being used to understand how teams work, collaborate, perform and thrive. August saw a glut of excellent articles centred on ‘teams’. The first article from McKinsey examines how to enable small independent teams, which according to the authors are the lifeblood of a truly agile organisation (see <em>Figure 8</em>). The second article outlines five ways to harness technology to improve communication and collaboration within virtual teams. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisonmoser/"" target=""_blank"">Allison Moser</a> provides examples of how eBay, Buzzfeed and Etsy have improved the gender diversity of their teams. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferdawson1/"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Robertson</a> interviews leading team coach <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-clutterbuck-84aa6b/"" target=""_blank"">David Clutterbuck</a> on the role he sees AI playing in team coaching.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 8</em></strong><em>: HOW TO ENABLE SMALL TEAMS IN AN AGILE COMPANY (SOURCE: MCKINSEY)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If Bob Dylan wrote a song about the 21st Century workplace, he may well title it “The Skills They Are A Changin’”, and even that wouldn’t do justice to the shift taking place in our midst. These four articles provide evidence of this. First Culture Amp’s Chief Scientist <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/39748903jkljdl/"" target=""_blank"">Jason McPherson</a>, outlines the four techniques that every people scientist needs to know. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsschmidt/"" target=""_blank"">Lars Schmidt</a>highlights four skills that emerged from the recent HR Open Source survey that HR leaders of the future will need (and yes, business and data acumen is one of them). Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> describes the importance of political skill and its relationship with network centrality. Finally, some fascinating research from BCG presents the five areas (see <strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong>) that make up the algorithm of the ideal 21st Century CEO.  </p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 9:</em></strong><em> A SUCCESS ALGORITHM FOR THE 21ST CENTURY CEO (SOURCE: BCG)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Many of the challenges facing people analytics are outlined in the articles I’ve selected this month. Therefore, it seems apt that my choice as video of the month features six people analytics leaders describing these and other challenges facing the space.

This study notably places leadership and talent above much more supposedly newsworthy issues such as political uncertainty, economic instability or even the threat from new competitors.   </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: The Global Leadership Forecast 2018, top 10 challenges (Source: Development Dimensions International, The Conference Board and EY, 2018)</em></p>, <p>A similar finding was also identified in The Conference Board’s<a href=""https://www.conference-board.org/ceo-challenge2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""> 2017 CEO Challenge</a> report.  The changing nature of the business landscape requires organisations to steer through uncertainties. No strategy can succeed if it is not backed by effective leadership.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Another significant transformation we are witnessing is the shift of economic power from the West to the East. Asia Pacific is not only home to more than 60% of the world’s population but has also enjoyed unprecedented economic growth and is therefore attracting a lot of interest and investment from businesses across the globe. With this comes the prerequisite of top notch talent in Asia, leadership being the most vital as it ultimately paves the way for future success. Indeed, research by renowned HR and leadership guru <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> and Justin Allen into <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.843.5790&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">how talent delivers performance for Asian firms</a> found empirical evidence that Asian leaders who invest in talent development will increase their organisation’s business performance.</p>, <p>Billions of dollars are spent annually on leadership development programs ($14 Bn in the US alone in 2014 according to Forbes). Asia is no exception. Yet research shows that most leadership development programs in the region fail to achieve desired outcomes. Why is that? Is there something unique about the way leadership is defined in Asia? How can People Analytics help? </p>, <p>To get more visibility on these questions and more, I spoke with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arun-sundar-2290237/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Sundar</a> who has a deep understanding of People Analytics and experience in building and running businesses in the West and in the East. Arun is currently the Chief Strategy Officer of <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> and the founder of The Social Capital Institute. In this interview in addition to providing an explanation of the differences associated with practicing people analytics when it comes to leadership in Asia, Arun has also invited comments from other experts in the HR and people analytics community in the region. </p>, <p>As such, this article includes contributions from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-yip-6ba765109/"" target=""_blank"">Grace Yip </a> Managing Director &amp; Head of HR, Accenture ASEAN, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peta-latimer-a239664/"" target=""_blank"">Peta Latimer</a> CEO Mercer (Singapore)<em> </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hunter-morgan-davis-685114b9/"" target=""_blank"">Hunter Morgan Davis</a> People Analytics Lead at Grab.</p>, <p><em>Contributors to this article (L to R): Arun Sundar (TrustSphere), Grace Yip (Accenture), Peta Latimer (Mercer) and Hunter Morgan Davis (Grab)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>‘Leadership’ is essentially leading people towards a desired direction. This requires a vigilant interplay between the ‘people’ who are led and the ‘system’ that they belong to. Both the people and the systems are vastly different in the East and the West. Hence ‘leadership’ as a concept is also bound to differ. In the East, ‘the individual is a subset of the system’ whereas in the West ‘a system is a collection of individuals’. This difference, though subtle, is very profound. It renders itself in the expectations of a leader. In the West, the primary focus is on ‘individual empowerment and human capital optimisation’ while the East tends towards ‘group harmony, optimisation of the system and social capital expansion’ which in turn trickles down to the individual. Hence the objective of leadership and the ‘concept’ of leadership itself differs in the East compared to the West.</p>, <p>Having said that, this dichotomy may not be immutable, especially in organisations and communities where the Western values around libertarian thinking are gaining prominence. In effect, organisations in the East fall into a broad spectrum of ‘purely eastern’ on one end to ‘westernised’ on the other. Most reside in between; where the interchange of Western and Eastern influences co-exists to varying degrees. The expectations and the very definition of leadership depends on where the organisation is on this spectrum. </p>, <p><strong>Grace Yip</strong> a good friend and Managing Director and Head of HR, Accenture ASEAN is one of the few HR leaders who appreciates this difference, in her words; </p>, <p><em>“The main difference between how leadership is viewed in the East and West lies with the perspectives that we grow up with, and the role models we hold close to our hearts and who inspire us. I find that in today’s world, there is more of a meeting in the middle, and an appreciation of different perspectives. Leaders now need to flex more across different situations instead of being rigid to a single approach. In a time where innovation is propelling our world forward, pivoting our leadership behaviour towards one that is more agile, adaptive and more context sensitive is becoming more important than ever” </em><strong>Grace Yip,</strong> <strong>Managing Director &amp; Head of HR, Accenture ASEAN</strong></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>As I mentioned earlier, organisations in the East are not uniform in the extent to which they are influenced by Western thinking. Understanding where it stands in this spectrum (of East and West) is very important. This is where a discipline backed by science and data such as People Analytics can help. </p>, <p>It goes even further. Understanding what traits are critical to a leader specific to that organisation and its culture, then measuring those traits together with measuring the effectiveness of programs for the enhancement of these traits are areas where People Analytics can help. </p>, <p>Let me explain with an example.</p>, <p>We know that ‘power distance’ is viewed differently in the East and the West. This is a vector that can reveal where the organisation lies in the spectrum of Eastern values to Western thinking. Understanding the extent of ‘power distance’ that is acceptable (sometimes it is a requirement in certain cultures) is crucial in leadership development. In a system where power distances are very high, the social capital distribution of leaders will mirror the organisation chart with limited skip level relationships. Techniques like Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) can help uncover these patterns, by helping to identify future leaders and programs that could be built to develop these leaders.</p>, <p><strong>Peta Latimer</strong>, CEO of Mercer in Singapore,<em> </em>has a ring side view of the state of leadership development in Asia, I agree with her views when she says;</p>, <p><em>“The need to upskill, reskill and redeploy the workforce has caught the attention of most Executive teams across Asia due to significant investments in digital transformation. Many leaders understand the extent of change required but appear to have less of an appreciation of what they themselves need to start doing differently. This is particularly prevalent in Asia where leadership is often associated with positional power, hierarchy and tenure” </em><strong>Peta Latimer, CEO Mercer (Singapore)</strong></p>, <p> </p>, <p>David, you will recall in our <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-asia-pacific-why-different-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">previous interview</a> I made reference to the framework of People Analytics (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below):</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: A framework for people analytics (Source: Arun Sundar and Dipti Gulati, TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p>All of the four stages above are nuanced for every organisation as each has a different culture. In hierarchical organisations, communication is formal and gets captured as most interactions are official. Informal communications tend to be higher in the more ‘westernised’ organisations. Data is created differently, depending on the culture of the organisation. Not only data creation but also the subsequent stages of data collection, analytics and consumption of analytics vary from one to the other. However, the biggest fluctuation comes at the ‘data collection’ stage. Which data points matter and by how much would change from one organisation to another, as would the expectations and perceptions of leaders vary too. </p>, <p><strong>Hunter Morgan Davis</strong> is one of the most enthusiastic practitioners of People Analytics in the region, his views in this context are interesting;</p>, <p><em>“I find that the dimensions of culture (e.g., power distance, time orientation, etc.) do impact the approach leaders and their organisations take to People Analytics. This helps explain the different values that companies and their respective cultures place on factors that impact the entire people analytics lifecycle. Do we keep data anonymous or confidential? How do we want to share data and insights across the company? Culture drives how leaders answer these fundamental questions, which then impacts the type of data you collect, how and where you store it, and then what you can do with your data after. Finally, ensuring that these values and the approach to people analytics are aligned are critical to the success of people analytics teams” </em><strong><em>Hunter Morgan Davis, People Analytics Lead at Grab</em></strong></p>, <p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>, <p>There are a few interesting examples that come to my mind. I know for sure that ‘Tenure’ is a hugely important vector in leadership in the East. The more Eastern an organisation the more weight is placed on ‘tenure’ as a data point in quantifying for leadership potential. There are certain cultures where irrespective of capability tenure is a must for a leader to be recognised. A simple Bayesian algorithm to calculate an individual’s capability for leadership will essentially assign a high weightage to ‘tenure’. Classifying this weightage, will also reflect where the organisation stands in the spectrum and how important is the vector of tenure to its leader.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>My primary advice is “Do not presume”. While the difference between the Eastern and Western cultures is not ‘chalk and cheese’, the understanding of the subtle nuances is important when one is looking at ‘leadership and its traits’. Organisations need to review and be sure that the very essence of leadership is clearly defined in its own context. Even the same organisation would have different expectations in diverse regions. Therefore, be sure of the premise, then look at data to solve or better it! </p>, <p>In essence, the journey to leverage People Analytics for leadership should start with a whiteboard to define what ‘leadership’ is to your organisation.</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>Thank you, Arun. Very insightful, as ever.</p>, <p>With this century touted to be an Asian one, and the world’s economy and people development heavily reliant on Asia, the importance of leadership development in Asia is clearly high-priority. </p>, <p>The DDI, Conference Board and EY study referenced in the introduction of this article substantiates this where the development of Next-Gen leaders ranks above more traditional concerns such as political instability, fears of a global recession and competitors; this holds true for the 1,000 C-Level Executives who participated in the study.</p>, <p>However, an approach to leveraging People Analytics for leadership development in the east without appreciating the differences outlined in this article could not only be ineffective but also be detrimental. There is no ‘one size fits all’ format and as such, global organisations with operations in Asia Pacific would do well to take a unique approach that is best suited to the region. This must be applicable at all stages through the People Analytics journey, right from collecting, analysing and gaining insights from projects undertaken in the region. </p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>Thanks to Arun, as well as Grace Yip, Peta Latimer and Hunter Morgan Davis for sharing their knowledge and insights in this article.

David R. Green,"July 26, 2018",How to create career paths for people analytics professionals,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-create-career-paths-people-analytics-david-green/,"[<p>According to Bersin by Deloitte’s <a href=""http://marketing.bersin.com/rs/976-LMP-699/images/Infographic-HIPAN-TopFindings.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">High-Impact People Analytics study</a>, which was published in November 2017, 69% of large organisations (10,000+ employees) now have a people analytics team.</p>, <p>It is a surprise then that many organisations overlook the need to develop the careers of their people analytics team. Given the pace of evolution of the field and the high-demand for talent in the space, this is an oversight that needs correction.</p>, <p>As such, it was refreshing that the main focus of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetanjali-gamel-17209b68/"" target=""_blank"">Geetanjali Gamel</a>’s presentation earlier this year at the <a href=""https://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work</a> Conference in San Francisco (see key learnings <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analytics-people-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) was on this very topic.</p>, <p>Geetanjali is the global leader of workforce analytics at Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada). I caught up with Geetanjali recently to ask how she has created career development paths for her team as well as discuss other related topics in the people analytics field.</p>, <p><em>Geetanjali Gamel speaking at the People Analytics &amp; Future of Work Conference in Philadelphia in September 2017</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Like many of my colleagues in people analytics, I’ve had a non-linear path to my current role. I am a trained economist and began my career in research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis studying topics like macroeconomic forecasting, unemployment and inflation.  With this foundation in social science methodology and research, I soon transitioned to business forecasting, predictive analysis and scenario-planning to drive customer growth and revenue projections in corporate planning and finance departments in the energy sector. The most intriguing part of my work was in understanding, measuring and predicting human behaviour and its impact on business outcomes such as sales and revenue. So, I was naturally attracted by the opportunity to bring scientific methodology to people data and help shape how an organisation can drive value for its investors <em>along with</em> enhanced experience for its employees. I began by building a predictive analytics function from scratch in HR in my previous role at Mastercard and since 2016 I have led the advanced workforce analytics, consulting and reporting organisation in Merck HR.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Merck’s workforce analytics team (WFA) has 15 members who support 69,000 employees in over 80 markets worldwide through a rich portfolio of people analytics products.</p>, <p>The team consists of three primary pillars; Consulting, Advanced Analytics, and Reporting &amp; Data Visualisation (see <em>Figure 1</em> below).</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: The Workforce Analytics team at Merck &amp; Co (Source: Geetanjali Gamel)</em></p>, <p>The three WFA teams work closely with each other to ensure that any synergies between business initiatives are identified and leveraged.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I agree that culture can be the strongest catalyst or impediment for people analytics. It is also ridiculously difficult to identify and alter, particularly because organisations at any given time tend to be collections of sub-cultures. But there are some patterns of behaviours, decision-making, and incentive-rewards, which distinguish data driven cultures from others. These behaviours can be purposefully incubated through a combination of upskilling, training and mind-set building.</p>, <p>At Merck, we believe that a leading HR function is one where analytics capability is not only for the analytics team, but the whole HR team. This does not imply that every role requires equal depth in analytics, but a new baseline of data interpretation and communication skills is critical to being effective partners to the business. To this end, we started out by democratising data within our HR community by rolling out a cloud based workforce analytics platform. This is helping us drive greater familiarity and reliance on data among our HR users. We have also developed and deployed a capability-building program with modules focused on metric selection, hypothesis testing, data visualisation, recommendation development, and more.</p>, <p>Another channel that we have been leveraging to accelerate a data driven culture in HR has been to engage members of our wider HR community as analytics “Champions”. These superheroes are critical to spreading the adoption of data informed insights, since they live and breathe the daily challenges of their colleagues; and can share relatable examples with their counterparts on how data can unlock value.</p>, <p>Finally, we also have an HR leadership team that is aligned and strong advocates in relaying the message of building data and analytics capability in HR. Needless to say, sponsorship of senior leaders is imperative to the success of a people analytics function.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I firmly believe that the goal of people analytics is to drive value for the business <em>as well as </em>provide<em> </em>a<em> </em>better experience of work for employees. So naturally, I am equally passionate about building a better work experience for the people who make people analytics possible! I find a sad irony in the fact that the team which enables decision-making on areas like career pathing, succession planning, and talent movement for the larger workforce, is often stuck in a position of having nowhere to grow. From my discussions with many colleagues in this field, I have learned that the typical people analytics team usually tends to have a group of individual contributors (analysts, data scientists, consultants) and a director or senior director level leader. This leaves only one spot for the entire team to aspire to, at least for upward movement. </p>, <p>In addition, most people analytics teams sit within HR and tend to be branded as a highly-specialised “HR-lite” centre of excellence (CoE), which limits the opportunities to move laterally or upward into other HR roles in CoEs or business units. And this reality of being “boxed-in” can be very frustrating for bright, highly-employable individuals.</p>, <p>If you are a leader in people analytics, <em>and if you have had to recently recruit new talent for your team</em>, I would guess you are acutely aware of the gaping chasm between talent demand and supply in this field. In my opinion, an organisation and a leader who can offer development and career growth can be a key differentiator in attracting and retaining the best people analytics talent. </p>, <p>Broadening that vision, if we enabled more fluid movement of people analytics talent, it would add to the diversity of skills, approaches and perspectives to other parts of HR and the business, and would create additional value for the enterprise.</p>, <p>From the first day of my role at Merck, one of my top priorities was to understand the strengths and aspirations of my team and align their development to meet their career goals. After multiple discussions and numerous iterations on ideas, I arrived at a <strong>Capability-Capacity-Connectivity</strong> model to power a sustainable development program for our people analytics team. The underlying idea is that if we can build the right <em>capability</em> within the analytics team and its clients; reallocate <em>capacity </em>that is being consumed by suboptimal tasks; and drive <em>connectivity</em> between people analytics teams and other parts of the business; then we can potentially discover and create new career paths and opportunities. But please bear in mind that a key driver of success for such a model is sponsorship from your leaders and partnership with other teams. In our case, we were fortunate to have both. This has empowered us to be inventive and co-create development opportunities for our team.</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p><strong> </strong>The “3C” approach is built around tackling barriers and creating bridges that promote career development for people analytics teams. At the outset we knew that the team was faced with a high volume of requests needing significant manual effort. (<em>see Figure 2 below</em>):</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Challenges in accelerating maturity in people analytics (Source: Geetanjali Gamel)</em></p>, <p>Since the day-to-day work was time and effort intensive, there was not much room to hone more sophisticated skills or build knowledge sharing relationships with others, leaving the people analytics team stuck in a loop. So, we put careful thought and purpose into adopting the following model.</p>, <p>The first “C”, or capability, had to be addressed at two levels. The first was to empower our broader HR team with the right tools and training to have greater autonomy to perform analyses. We moved to an intuitive analytics platform and organised workshops, office hours, and learning sessions to improve data literacy among our internal HR clients. This type of effort is important to free-up time for the people analytics team to build their own skillset (and path to growth), while also creating a greater awareness in other parts of HR about analytics. </p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Capability - Level 1: building data, technology and analytics savvy clients (Source: Geetanjali Gamel)</em></p>, <p>The second area of capability building had a more direct impact on the team. We held a team strategy session where we identified areas that needed focus for internal functional, technical and strategic competency building. These focus areas were carefully selected to create dual impact – provide us with a skill or knowledge we could use immediately in our work; and more importantly, help us practice a new behaviour that would develop us as well-rounded professionals. For example, on the technical side, we organised an in-house R-training curriculum, created and delivered by some of our own colleagues to the rest of the team. This helped us build a technical skill we could immediately put to use to do better work, and also built coaching and confidence skills for those who led the program. Another great example was of an external guest speaker series that we launched, which brought recognition to the team for bringing new insights to the company, and also helped the team gain experience in organising an event successfully end-to-end. </p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Capability - Level 2: Upskilling the people analytics team (Source: Geetanjali Gamel)</em></p>, <p>At first, capacity building measures may not sound like a natural fit with developing career paths. But it is impossible to focus on the next steps in one’s career if there is no time to step away from the daily barrage of activity to have a conversation; listen to a webinar; learn about a new project; or simply, chat with colleagues over lunch. As such creating capacity for the team is critical to allow them to develop their skillset to be more widely applicable, as well as to build the networks they need to find new opportunities. </p>, <p>As mentioned before, our journey began with democratising data and providing a range of workforce metrics and even results of our enterprise voice survey in accessible cloud platforms to our HR community. We continue to supplement our efforts to empower our internal clients, <em>and in the process unlock capacity for our team</em>, by forming global communities of practice for analytics. Another effort to scale our analytics delivery and save precious time has been by finding opportunities to utilise process automation on repeatable tasks.</p>, <p>Despite efforts in building capability and reallocating capacity, there can’t be much career development if there is nowhere to go! This is when the third “C” of connectivity comes into play. In fact, it could just as easily be C for creativity, because we need a great deal of innovative thinking and risk taking to create opportunities where they don’t always exist.</p>, <p>We started with small yet effective steps rather than trying to construct huge, formal programs. Connecting the people analytics team with other HR, data science, technology, and business professionals builds an awareness and appreciation for different types of work on both sides. We leveraged opportunities to co-create part-time assignments with other teams, participate in cross functional events, invite guest speakers to team meetings, and collaborate on projects to expose the team to other areas of analytical work.</p>, <p>To create development assignments for the people analytics team we were creative and went with “quasi-experiments”. The first was an opportunity for a team member to take on the role of an HR business partner on a part-time basis for a few, smaller client groups. This gave the individual an opportunity to apply their analytical skillset to the role and get much greater exposure than before to business clients and business issues. Such an experiment has a multiplier effect. Where typically a business partner track is not easily available to a people analytics professional, creating such an opportunity internally can open up a new career path. Moreover, even if the individual does not end up pursuing this new career direction at the end of the experiment, it is still a valuable learning experience for them to be in the shoes of their internal client, i.e., the HR business partner. Finally, it may help to lay the foundation for what I like to call the HRBP 3.0 model. </p>, <p>Where the original <strong><em>HRBP</em></strong> role had a heavy component of <strong><em>operational</em></strong> (and even transactional) work, the <strong><em>HRBP 2.0</em></strong> model that many companies follow today aims at <strong><em>strategic</em></strong> business partners who enable key business decisions. The <strong><em>HRBP 3.0 </em></strong>model takes it a step further by envisioning an <strong><em>analytical</em></strong> HR business partner, who relies on both data driven insight and business acumen to support their client.</p>, <p>Another “experiment” in creating new career opportunities was a mini-assignment we created for one of our people analytics team members to lead a large, remote team in the service delivery space. This was a completely different line of work from people analytics, and was heavily focused on operational and organisational skills like identifying and escalating issues on short deadlines, supplier relationship management, building relationships with a variety of HR and non HR stakeholders, and leading a service centre team to drive customer satisfaction. Clearly, this would not be a typical career path for a people analytics professional, but that is exactly why we need to be bold and creative with such experiments. This assignment not only exposed the individual to a different type and pace of work, but also gave them an opportunity to bring their analytical skills to the table to significantly elevate the usage and interpretation of transactional data.</p>, <p>While many mature organisations have good-sized people analytics teams, there are still many where the teams are pretty lean. This model may work well for most purposes, but it usually limits the opportunities for team-members to have people management experience. This is not always necessary for upward mobility, but it many cases it is difficult to move upward without some kind of experience of leading a team. Keeping this in mind, we built more depth in our people analytics team, creating <em>enterprise advanced people analytics </em>and <em>data visualisation and reporting </em>sub<em>-</em>teams within the larger group, which are led by two of our team members. Taking a chance on subject matter experts and giving them the opportunity to lead and delegate not only helps to open up doors for them, it also gives them a chance to coach others on their team to be future experts and leaders.</p>, <p>Lastly, we also created a new learning analytics role on our people analytics team which is a step toward building greater synergies between people analytics and learning practices, but also our small contribution in creating a new capability (and career path!) that is still evolving in many organisations.  </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I think everyone has different strengths and experiences, which means their approach will vary with regards to them proving successful as a people analytics leader. But based on my personal experiences and observations of others, I can share five attributes that I think apply universally and are important to being an effective leader in this space.</p>, <p>I strive to practice the same behaviours that I would advise new people analytics leaders to try. For example, I follow and subscribe to content by certain thought leaders in people analytics and read as many varied publications as possible (blogs, articles, whitepapers, books) which keep me connected to the different aspects of people analytics; from social science to artificial intelligence. </p>, <p>In addition, it really helps to connect with other practitioners in the field from different industries, which I do via both informal and formal peer networks. This helps to broaden one’s worldview, spark new ideas, and offers a forum to ask questions of your peers. Most likely, if you are facing a people analytics quandary, there is a leader out there who has faced it too and would be willing to share their experience.</p>, <p>Finally, there are a plethora of great conference events out there, and the quality and number of these keeps rising every year. I try to participate in at least a few such events every year to learn new things and meet new people. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I think that a number of “hot areas” in people analytics will continue to get “hotter” in the future. The idea of employee experience will grow even wider with focus on the end-to-end experience all the way from being a prospective candidate stage to becoming an alumni of the company. This is likely to grow simultaneously with the focus on managing and optimising a new, fluid workforce that may at any one time be full-time and freelance, human and robotic. </p>, <p>I also think that the power of networks will be fully explored and unleashed as research grows and more organisations invest in this space. The applications of network analysis are so varied and relevant, that it should continue to gather steam in the future.</p>, <p>Finally, from my perspective to enable all these types of analyses, one of the most critical areas that will grow in importance will be the study of ethics relating to data use, privacy and security in the space of people analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This is a great question, and a difficult one to answer. The frontiers of what is possible are being pushed at a break-neck speed thanks to ever larger datasets being at our disposal faster, and at cheaper cost. And that pace makes it tough to process the implications in real time. In fact, this often leads to an overreaction or the inclination to adopt an overly conservative approach that can hamper some great work in the people analytics space. </p>, <p>That being said, I believe that an extremely important fact to understand about the space we work in is that we should not do something just because it is possible. Besides being legally compliant, the type of work being undertaken in this field needs to put ethics at the very top of the agenda even before beginning work on an analysis. Working closely with the appropriate experts in the practices of employment law, privacy law, ethics, communications, business partners and workers councils is a good way to ensure that besides the legality of the work, its potential impact on people is also being considered through the lens of ethics, privacy, <em>and empathy</em>.  Most established organisations have extensive reviews involving these types of stakeholders already in place.</p>, <p>Another way to pressure test the approach from an ethics lens is to share possible outcomes of an analysis with the internal clients beforehand and ask them to articulate what actions they would take in each scenario. Obviously, this method is not possible in every situation, but when applicable it can be a useful “stop and reflect” moment.</p>, <p>Thank you to Geetanjali for providing her time and considerable knowledge on this critical topic.

David R. Green,"July 5, 2018",The best HR & People Analytics articles of June 2018,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-june-2018-david-green/,"[<p>We are in the midst of World Cup fever here in the UK – England even won a penalty shootout against Colombia this week, defying the predictive algorithm (and history) in the process. The data now suggests that England has a reasonably good chance of making it to the World Cup Final on 15th July. One can only hope <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM"" target=""_blank"">it’s coming home</a>!</p>, <p>The only thing as popular as football currently in our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re4aDJL3heA"" target=""_blank"">world in motion</a> is of course people analytics (no, really!) and June was a busy month for me with speaking engagements in London, St Petersburg, Paris and Toronto. </p>, <p>At the end of June, I was in Zurich where <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> unveiled <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a>’s new Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People AnalyticsTM model (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) to their European clients. I have been fortunate to work with Jonathan in the development of this model in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-reasons-ive-joined-insight222-board-advisor-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">my role as Board Advisor to Insight222</a>. More detail on the model will follow in the coming weeks: It's something I'm really excited about<strong><em>. </em></strong></p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>: <em>The Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People AnalyticsTM (Source: Insight222 Limited)</em></p>, <p>In tribute to the World Cup, I’ve extended the usual 10 articles to an XI this month. I’m confident that this line-up could take on anyone:</p>, <p>One of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">the hottest areas of people analytics and HR is ONA</a> and how it can be used to identify insights that help drive improvements in critical areas such as productivity, innovation, collaboration and performance. This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/antony-ebelle-ebanda-07642b/"" target=""_blank"">Antony Ebelle-Ebanda</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> of <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> is a terrific primer on what ONA is and why it’s growing in importance. Most helpful though is the practical examples offered on how ONA can be applied to support i) identification of HiPOs, ii) measurement of leadership behaviours, iii) improving employee wellness, and iv) increasing diversity and inclusion (see example in <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>). A valuable addition to the growing resources available on ONA, which I’ll be featuring in my next <a href=""https://us18.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=e0b52874f211caf2aa39d4929&amp;id=8848ad53e3"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Data Driven HR Newsletter</a>, which you can <a href=""http://eepurl.com/dqO4_5"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">subscribe to here</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: Significant gender differences in networking behaviour (Source: TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p>June saw the publication of not just one, or two but three outstanding research studies on the field of people analytics from the CIPD, i4CP/ROI Institute and LinkedIn Talent Solutions.</p>, <p>The <a href=""https://www.cipd.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CIPD</a> study provides a host of insights, not least that a strong people analytics culture leads to positive business outcomes as well as <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below, which suggests that confidence in conducting analysis varies significantly in the regions covered by the research – the UK appears to have much less confidence in analytics than it does about the chances of England at the World Cup.

Examples on how to build a people analytics team and case studies are provided from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwhite612/"" target=""_blank"">David White</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrislouie/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Louie</a>, who lead people analytics at LinkedIn and Nielsen respectively.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: North American companies apply HR Analytics by industry (Source: LinkedIn Talent Solutions)</em></p>, <p>File all three studies under mandatory reading.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The next two articles detail a case study from Microsoft's people analytics team and then an interview with the Head of People Analytics at Capital One.</p>, <p>Onboarding is a critical but often overlooked component with bad experience and processes contributing to unnecessary and avoidable attrition. This case study describes how Microsoft’s People Analytics team combined qualitative (survey of new hires at seven and 90 days) and quantitative (calendar and email meta data) data with engagement data to reveal insights to help inform the onboarding process moving forward. The key discovery being that it is critical for a new employee to have a one-on-one meeting with their manager during their first week. Those who did saw early growth in three key areas: network strength and centrality, better quality meetings and early team collaboration.</p>, <p>The third in an excellent <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work</a> series of interviews with people analytics leaders, which previously featured <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> (see #3 <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-may-2018-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetanjali-gamel-17209b68/"" target=""_blank"">Geetanjali Gamel</a> (#5 <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-march-2018-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). This time <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a>, who leads the team at Capital One, provides a number of invaluable insights not least on how to increase the likelihood of insights leading to actions (the last mile problem for people analytics?). In this critical element of people analytics, Guru recommends: i) productising insights and putting them in the hands of decision makers, ii) building strong relationships with business leaders, and iii) building and deploying products for employees.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If you could name one person to write a Foreword to a study assessing the impact of AI on HR then it would be <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>, so credit to <a href=""https://cognitionx.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CognitionX</a> for doing just that. Josh’s Foreword highlights the ‘killer apps’ emerging across HR (e.g. recruiting, learning, engagement etc) and examines the risks (aka ethics) and what all this means for the field of people analytics. The report itself is an extensive study on the impact of AI on HR, which includes one of the best categorisations I've come across yet of the vendors driving innovation in the HR space (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below). Click here to download the report (and Josh’s Foreword). Great work from my Insight222 partner-in-crime <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> alongside <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/meganmariebutler/"" target=""_blank"">Megan Marie Butler</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>Fig 6</em></strong><em>: HR AI Market Scan: 60+ companies gaining traction (Source: CognitionX)</em></p>, <p>In this revealing article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> highlights <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TI People</a> research on the need for HR to focus on skill management in order to enable organisational agility. The research also emphasises how companies are shifting from the traditional way of segmenting the workforce by role and function to one based on skills (see <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong>). Volker then outlines the five key building blocks of a skills-based organisation, as determined through co-creation with members of TI People's <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/digital-hr-program"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Digital HR Program</a> such as Cisco, Zalando and Solvay, and technology to enable an agile workforce.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong><em>: The shift in how companies segment their workforce towards skills (Source: TI People)</em></p>, <p>In this article for <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a>, I interviewed <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/trishuhl/"" target=""_blank"">Trish Uhl</a>, one of the leading experts globally on learning and development. The insights and examples Trish provided are fascinating and cover areas such as: i) the key challenges in the L&amp;D space that people analytics is helping organisations to address, ii) linkage to business outcomes and employee experience, iii) how analytics and AI is revolutionising how L&amp;D programs are designed, delivered and evaluated, and iv) advice to HR leaders looking to apply people analytics in the L&amp;D domain.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the most popular articles in last month’s collection was <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a>’s article on agility being the key organisational capability of our time. It goes without saying that Ulrich is one of the leading global authorities on HR and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/detail/recent-activity/posts/"" target=""_blank"">his weekly articles on LinkedIn</a> are a must-read for all of us who seek to progress the field to make it ""<em>pivotal for business success and employee wellbeing</em>"". This article describes the need for HR to shift from circular thinking (repeating the past) to spiral thinking (creating the future).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Last month’s ‘Diversity Special’ proved so popular, I decided to reprise it with four new articles to illustrate how people analytics can support, further and validate diversity and inclusion programs. First up, another terrific study from the CIPD provides evidence on the business case for diversity and then highlights the key actions needed to drive change. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-richmond/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Richmond</a> summarises the discussions at a recent <a href=""https://www.meetup.com/HRAnalyticsPros/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York Strategic HR Analytics MeetUp</a>*, covering what inclusion means, how to measure it, the role of technology and what the future of inclusion is. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminssnyder/"" target=""_blank"">Benjamin Snyder</a> summarises the highlights of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lesliehm/"" target=""_blank"">Leslie Miley</a>’s recent speech at the New York edition of LinkedIn’s Talent Intelligence Experience on how data can be used to make workplaces more inclusive and equitable. Finally, behavioural scientists <a href=""https://twitter.com/iamlindachang"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Linda Chang</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/profcikara"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mina Cikara</a> describe the results of experiments they took to see if you can reduce bias in the hiring process.</p>, <p>*<em>Brian is one of the co-organisers of the New York Strategic HR Analytics Meetup Group along with </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/slupushor/"" target=""_blank""><em>Stela Lupushor</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyashapiro/"" target=""_blank""><em>Jeremy Shapiro</em></a><em> and </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiparkcoll/"" target=""_blank""><em>Philip Arkcoll</em></a><em>. The group has over 1100 members, and I highly recommend it to anyone residing in the New York area who is working or interested in the field of people analytics.</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I came across less people analytics themed podcasts than usual in June, but these two gems are certainly worth a spin. First, the always listenable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattalder/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Alder</a> speaks to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinblair/"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Blair</a>, Global VP of Talent Acquisition, about the cognitive recruiting journey at IBM on the Recruiting Future podcast. Then, the equally listenable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghanmbiro/"" target=""_blank"">Meghan Biro</a> discusses the power of people data with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/katehastings/"" target=""_blank"">Kate Hastings</a>, Senior Director of Insights at LinkedIn, and how HR is using people data to eliminate bias, close the gender gap, and drive better outcomes.</p>, <p>I’m currently immersed in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a>’s new book ‘Adaptive Space’. The book describes how, in his role as Chief Talent Officer, Michael applied ONA to foster networks, ideas, information and resources to drive innovation at GM, as well as how other organisations have also applied a similar approach. From what I've read so far I can highly recommend Michael’s book and believe it is a landmark publication in terms of providing evidence of the power of ONA. If you need further endorsement, you might want to check out <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobsutton1/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Sutton</a>’s review <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/yes-elephant-can-dance-general-motors-chief-talent-officer-bob-sutton/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The recent <a href=""https://cogx.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CogX</a> event in London was a roaring success with over 6,500 attendees and 370 speakers over the two days. If you were one of the unlucky ones (like me) who couldn’t get along, never fear because the helpful people at CognitionX have made videos of most of the sessions available on their YouTube channel. The highlight for me is this engrossing discussion on the impact of AI on HR and recruitment, chaired by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> and featuring an esteemed panel of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-gee-kee-167b705/"" target=""_blank"">Melissa Gee Kee</a> (Unilever), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock/"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a>. Tons of insights in this must-watch 37 minute video.</p>, <p>June was a packed month for conferences. As well as the aforementioned CogX event, I was also unable to attend what looked like superb events such as Visier Outsmart (see <a href=""https://www.visier.com/clarity/be-courageous-with-people-analytics-recap-of-visier-outsmart-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">key takeaways</a>) and Culture Amp’s Culture First conference (see <a href=""https://blog.cultureamp.com/what-was-it-like-to-attend-culture-first"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">key takeaways</a>). I was fortunate enough to speak at the <a href=""https://bbff.ru/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Big Business Fun Festival</a> in St Petersburg, the <a href=""http://hrtechsummit.com/toronto/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech Summit</a> in Toronto and LinkedIn’s Talent Intelligence Experience in Paris. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/johntherlihy/"" target=""_blank"">John Herlihy</a>’s review of the latter captures insights from my speech along with those of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarina-berg-5375074/"" target=""_blank"">Katarina Berg</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilycreek/"" target=""_blank"">Emily Firth</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/randhindi/"" target=""_blank"">Rand Hindi</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericowski/"" target=""_blank"">Eric Owski</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissafurze/"" target=""_blank"">Melissa Furze</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexgallafent/"" target=""_blank"">Alex Gallafent</a>.

David R. Green,"June 7, 2018",The best HR & People Analytics articles of May 2018,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-may-2018-david-green/,"[<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-april-2018-david-green"" target=""_blank"">Last month</a> I highlighted that people analytics had emerged as the joint top trend in the <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Deloitte 2018 Global Human Capital Trends</a> report. This signal that people analytics has now properly ‘arrived’ continued to grow in May, first as data featured prominently as part of the superb UNLEASH show in Las Vegas (see my <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/news/6-takeaways-from-unleash-america"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">key takeaways article</a>). Further reinforcement also came with the publication of the <a href=""https://hros.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Open Source</a> (#HROS) Future of Work Report which, (as <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below shows) highlighted that people analytics is now regarded as a foundational capability by HR professionals themselves. This augurs well for data-driven decision making to become the norm within HR.   </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: Key insights from #HROS Future of Work Survey (Source: HR Open Source) </em></p>, <p>Congratulations to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsschmidt/"" target=""_blank"">Lars Schmidt</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambrosiavertesi/"" target=""_blank"">Ambrosia Vertesi</a> on the continued growth of #HROS and the value it continues to provide to the community and also to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgelarocque/"" target=""_blank"">George LaRocque</a> for what is an absorbing report (Download the report <a href=""https://hros.co/future-of-work-2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p>, <p>Now on with this month’s countdown:</p>, <p>We kick off this month with the latest opus from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> (this time in concert with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-van-den-brink/"" target=""_blank"">Frank van den Brink</a>), which showcases the latest developments and thinking on people analytics at ABN Amro. I always enjoy Patrick’s commentary as not only is he one of the leading practitioners in our space, but he typically breaks new ground each time he publishes an article. That is certainly the case with this collaboration with Frank, which introduces the ‘Second wall for People Analytics’ (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>). This update of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a>’s wall focuses on the challenge of providing continuous analytics and leads in neatly to the main topic of the article – the continuous listening journey at ABN Amro. Frank and Patrick define what ‘continuous listening’ means to the bank, describe the active and passive data sources in scope and then lay out the path ahead in this critical area of employee insight. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a> gets a deserved mention from Patrick for her contribution to the debate on continuous listening – you can read my recently published article with Laura <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dos-donts-continuous-listening-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: The ‘Second wall for People Analytics’ (Source: Patrick Coolen and Frank van den Brink)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In last month’s countdown, I featured two articles that had been serialised by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> from his new book ‘<a href=""https://www.koganpage.com/product/data-driven-hr-9780749482466"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Data-Driven HR</a>’. Bernard has a rare knack of being able to describe often complex technologies and techniques in a language everyone can relate to. This time Bernard turns his attention to the GDPR and what it really means for HR. Even though the legislation has now come into effect, many HR teams are still floundering. As such, Bernard’s explanation of concepts such as privacy, consent, transparency and data protection is very timely. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this fascinating interview with <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, who leads the people analytics team at Microsoft, provides a compelling account on how to straddle the research-practice divide and bring people analytics to the business. As Dawn explains, balancing the rigour of research with the timelines of the business is a continual challenge. This means that businesses typically opt for correlational research and quasi-experiments in favour of research-based experiments into causal validity. Dawn offers a wealth of invaluable advice, emphasising the importance of partnering with the business, the need for continual learning and two-way knowledge sharing. The fifteen years of people analytics at Microsoft seems time well spent though as Dawn reflects that when it comes to talent development it is “<em>hard for us to imagine how we could have made progress without it</em>”.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Agility is described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> in his article as the key organisational capability of our time.  He goes on to explain that in our world of unrelenting change agility matters at four levels: strategic, organisational, individual and last but not least HR. Ulrich’s persuasive argument that “<em>HR practices around people, performance, information, and work can be crafted to foster strategic, organisation, and individual agility</em>” is both convincing and inspiring. This leads nicely on to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliacrocker/"" target=""_blank"">Alia Crocker</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidi-k-gardner-ab5b825/"" target=""_blank"">Heidi Gardner</a>’s article in HBR, which focuses on applying organisational network analysis (ONA) to help foster collaboration and agility in employee networks where it matters most - at the point of execution, where teams are working on new products, strategic initiatives, or with top clients (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>). Two inspiring articles that provide a big clue as to the future direction of HR, underpinned by analytics and which should be read alongside <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annatavis/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Tavis</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-cappelli-14936a3/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cappelli</a>’s superb recent HBR cover article ‘HR goes agile’ (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-march-2018-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">see our March countdown</a>). </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3: </em></strong><em>To manage collaboration, pay attention to four points of execution (Source: Harvard Business Review, Alia Crocker, Rob Cross and Heidi K. Gardner)</em></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>ONA and its role in people analytics was the subject of my speech at May’s <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> show in Las Vegas and also the theme of this article, which is designed to demystify what has rapidly become a topic du jour for HR and business leaders. It includes a definition of ONA, why the technique is increasing in importance, the difference between active and passive ONA, and examples of what companies can use ONA for. It also provides four case studies from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> at GM, <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> at Microsoft.  </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>Example use cases of Organisational Network Analysis (Source: David Green)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst not limited to the HR function, people analytics practitioners will relate to many of the red flags described in this revealing McKinsey article. Familiar challenges such as the absence of a clear vision from the executive team with regards to analytics, a lack of analytics translators, costly data cleansing exercises and an inability to attribute bottom line impact are all present. Another red flag described is that analytics roles are generally poorly defined, with the authors using <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> to outline the variety of talent and well-defined roles required. A sobering but ultimately insightful read. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>: <em>Organisations need a variety of analytics talent with well-defined roles (Click on the image to access the article/infographic where you can click on each role to see its responsibilities)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Two of the most astute observers in our field analyse the latest developments in the people analytics space. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> succinctly captures the latest major trends in what he prefers to call the ‘workforce analytics’ domain, describing the shift to continuous analytics and the increase in focus on productivity, teams, transparency and personalisation. Tom also offers some cautionary words on the inherent challenges in predicting human behaviour. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers/"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> also accentuates the positive in reflecting on the findings of the <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Deloitte 2018 Global Human Capital Trends</a> report, highlighting that the growth in people analytics can partly be attributed to a renewed focus on productivity and engagement. Luk also provides an interesting insight that for the first time in five years the gap between the importance of analytics and the readiness of organisations to practice it has fallen. Whether this is an indication that the tide has turned, or it is merely a blip, only time will tell. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/39748903jkljdl/"" target=""_blank"">Jason McPherson</a>, <a href=""https://www.cultureamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Culture Amp</a>’s Chief Scientist, continues to churn out some really insightful articles and this month he turns his attention to the significant impact leadership has on culture and engagement. As Jason explains, a decline in employee perception of leaders can lead to a sharp fall in engagement levels and take a long time to turn around. Fortunately, surveys can provide early indications that things might be about to go awry, which at least means that organisations can take preventative steps to avoid slipping off the cliff edge. Then based on data from over 200,000 people, Jason outlines (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong>) some of the key characteristics of good vs. poor leaders.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong><em>: Indicators of good vs. poor leadership (Source: Culture Amp, Jason McPherson)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This is a clever and fascinating article that asks the reader to step into the shoes of Aliyah and make a decision on whether to hire Molly (as per her instinct) or Ed, who the hiring algorithm and network analysis provided by the people analytics team predicts will be the stronger hire. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-polzer-17391612/"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Polzer</a>’s article features the thoughts of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5/"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a>, who leads Google’s People Analytics team, and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/pattymccord/"" target=""_blank"">Patty McCord</a>, ex-Chief Talent Officer of Netflix. The <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6408201576145653760/"" target=""_blank"">discussion thread</a> when I posted this is fascinating – I particularly enjoyed <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marktlawrence/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lawrence</a>’s comment <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6408365057377337344/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. If you were Aliyah, what would you do?</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>In a month where a BBC article described the <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44310225"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">top 10 worst excuses for not appointing women executives</a> it seems timely to provide several reminders as to why diversity in all its forms is not only the right thing to do but is good for business too. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> analyses research that suggests women actually make better leaders than men. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> highlights data from McKinsey (see <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong>) that links executive diversity in both gender and ethnicity to stronger business performance whilst warning that we must not rest on our laurels. Next Unilever CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nairleena/"" target=""_blank"">Leena Nair</a> provides a very personal account of why diversity is important to her. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/frida-polli-03a1855/"" target=""_blank"">Frida Polli</a> presents a ‘Diversity Tech Stack’ – technologies including her own company <a href=""https://www.pymetrics.com/employers/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pymetrics</a> as well as the likes of <a href=""https://textio.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Textio</a>, <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a> and <a href=""https://www.hackerrank.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HackerRank</a> that have been proven to enhance diversity outcomes in the hiring and promotion processes with global companies. The latest #HROS Case Study provides an excellent example of how (and why) Atlassian improved the gender and ethnic diversity of its technical graduate hires (kudos to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-price-0892243/"" target=""_blank"">Dom Price</a> and the Atlassian team for their continued sharing of their talent management practices). Finally, a revealing piece in The Atlantic on how Slack outperforms other Silicon Valley tech giants like Google and Facebook on diversity despite not having a designated ‘head of diversity’.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7: </em></strong><em>Gender and ethnic diversity are clearly correlated with profitability, but women and minorities remain underrepresented (Source: Keith McNulty | McKinsey, Delivering on Diversity)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This month’s collection of podcasts kicks off with a fascinating discussion between <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> on how ONA helped drive innovation at GM as well as previewing Michael’s forthcoming book ‘<a href=""https://www.adaptivespace.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Adaptive Space</a>’. Then McKinsey’s head honcho <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicsbarton/"" target=""_blank"">Dominic Barton</a> outlines why talent should be at the top of the CEO agenda (see <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong> for summary). <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annaott/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Ott</a>, who leads <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/startup"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH StartUp</a> then joins <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghanmbiro/"" target=""_blank"">Meghan Biro</a> for an insightful exploration of the future of HR Tech, which leads nicely on to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurieruettimann/"" target=""_blank"">Laurie Ruettimann</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattalder/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Alder</a> discussing on the Recruiting Future podcast how to fix HR Tech. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> wraps up the first series of WorkLife (already labelled ‘The Porsche of podcasts by Inc.) with perhaps the best episode yet a real tête-à-tête with <a href=""http://file:///Users/davidgreen/Desktop/@Gladwell"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Malcolm Gladwell</a>.</p>, <p><strong> <em>Figure 8</em></strong><em>: Winning with talent: The CEOs playbook for value creation (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>This month’s video features an absorbing discussion between Nobel Laureate and Thinking Fast and Slow author <a href=""https://kahneman.socialpsychology.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Kahneman</a> and MIT professor and author of The Second Machine Age <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikbrynjolfsson/"" target=""_blank"">Erik Brynjolfsson</a> on the perils and potential of machine-based decision-making. </p>, <p>For those of you (like me) who are old enough to remember the wait for the second Stone Roses album (not as good as the first, but not as bad as many would have us think), the anticipation of the great reveal on what <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock/"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/wcrosby/"" target=""_blank"">Wayne Crosby</a> and the team at <a href=""https://humu.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humu</a> are cooking up is very similar. This article offers a few clues and highlights i) they've raised over $40m in funding, ii) have had enquires from 20% of the Fortune 100 despite being in stealth mode, iii) their approach is overwhelmingly focused on improving the life of the employee, and iv) they believe the data revolution in HR is already here.

David R. Green,"June 4, 2018",The Dos and Don'ts of Continuous Listening,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dos-donts-continuous-listening-david-green/,"[<p>Over the last couple of years, we’ve been increasingly hearing about the concept of <em>Continuous Listening </em>being applied to employees - just as it has long been used by marketing to understand and act upon customer sentiment. A poll by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> of prominent HR and People Analytics leaders even pointed to Continuous Listening as being the #2 topic they most wanted to know more about (<strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: Continuous listening is a topic du jour for people analytics and senior HR leaders</em></p>, <p>Consequently, HR practitioners are starting to tune in as they try to understand the ways of implementing a Continuous Listening program within their own organisations. However, since the practice is still in its nascent stages, there is much confusion not only about the best practices, but the very definition of the concept.</p>, <p>I caught up recently with one of the most prominent experts in the field, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a>, who is leading the Continuous Listening offering at iNostix by Deloitte, to get her thoughts and tips on the best ways for organisations to move forward with this exciting and powerful topic.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>DG: Let’s start with the definition. In one of your </strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/4-guiding-principles-successful-continuous-listening-program-phd"" target=""_blank""><strong>latest articles,</strong></a><strong> you elaborated on the contextual framework of the term. What do you think are the most common misconceptions about Continuous Listening?</strong></p>, <p>LS: While Continuous Listening is a rather broad term, it does have certain parameters that it must adhere to in order to deliver sustainable impact and value. I often see organisations simplify the practice and reduce it to the introduction of survey apps or simply increasing the frequency of collecting feedback - without following through with the rest of the parameters.</p>, <p>Similarly, Continuous Listening is still too often approached as a ‘feel-good’ program – disconnected from the core strategic or business objectives. As a result, the program remains below the radar of senior executives. All together, these soft approaches seriously undermine the transformative potential of Continuous Listening programs. That means, the ability of Continuous Listening programs to radically change the way HR has been working: from a soft and process-centric to an evidence-based and employee-centric function.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: The 4 C's of Continuous Listening (Source: Laura Stevens - see </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/4-guiding-principles-successful-continuous-listening-program-phd/"" target=""_blank""><em>article</em></a><em>)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>DG: While Continuous Listening can’t be reduced to the practice of frequent surveys, they are an important part of the program. What is your advice to organisations in terms of their design?</strong></p>, <p>LS: First of all, I’m glad you mention the word ‘design’ in your question, as most organisations today still just ‘buy’ commercial survey questionnaires from the market. As tempting as this may seem, it is not a wise course of action. The insights gained from these surveys are usually disappointing because it’s hard (and sometimes impossible) to connect them to company-specific goals and priorities.</p>, <p>That brings me to my main point of advice: the criticality of designing a customised survey – with survey dimensions and questions tying back to the strategic imperatives of an organisation. In the same line, I recommend organisations to develop a very solid definition of what exactly they are trying to measure and why. Do they want to follow-up and evaluate the success of several milestones throughout a large-scale transformation? Is their main goal to equip managers with insights that enable them to better lead and motivate their teams more efficiently? Getting straight on this purpose is almost 60% of the work I would say, as it serves as a critical input to almost all other components of a survey strategy, as I discuss in one of my earlier <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-data-driven-employee-experience-should-include-continuous-phd/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_post_details%3BBJc9PypnSF6sKLN%2FmwuzuA%3D%3D"" target=""_blank"">articles</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>DG: What are some of the most common mistakes you see organisations make in implementing Continuous Listening programs?</strong></p>, <p>LS: Since Continuous Listening is a relatively new concept in HR, there is only a handful of best practices to learn from. In my experience, here are the two core and most common mistakes organisations make:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>DG: Let’s talk more about your last point. When an organisation is ready to invest into software to help manage its listening data, how should they go about finding the right solution?</strong></p>, <p>LS: Because the ultimate ambition of high-impact Continuous Listening programs should be to systematically collect and combine a variety of critical listening sources to drive holistic change, my advice would be to invest in a flexible analytical platform with automation capabilities. That means, a platform that is able to automatically ingest, integrate and analyse data coming from disparate systems or third parties (e.g. via API’s) to build a unified view of your employees. These platforms typically have a visualisation and authentication layer for report building and delivery purposes.</p>, <p>For most (smaller) organisations today, starting their journey towards Continuous Listening with an investment in such an analytical platform may not be realistic or feasible. But even than I think it’s valuable to keep this end goal in mind from the start and make the integration capabilities of smaller application and tools (e.g., a pulse app) a deliberate part of selection criteria. This will ensure these organisations can stay in front of the evolving data landscape and evolutions towards more data-driven and employee-centric decision-making.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>DG: What about finding the right partner for designing and implementing CL programs? What would be your recommendation?</strong></p>, <p>LS: In many ways, my advice would be similar to that of finding the right technological infrastructure. Look for a flexible partner who can help you to grow your Continuous Listening maturity along the way, as high-impact listening programs develop out of continuous experimentation.</p>, <p>A good partner will be able to help you navigate through the different options available and act as an independent, trusted advisor. Ideally, the right partner should have deep expertise in translating organisational priorities in robust people measurement, sampling and reporting strategies and can equally advise you on data integration and insight generation strategies (i.e., defining analytical techniques to translate data into actionable insights).</p>, <p>Equally important is to find a partner who combines this expertise with a record of accomplishment in this area. I’ve learned how getting an organisation aligned around a more holistic and cross-functional way of listening should be managed as a change. Facilitating this change requires designing a clear value proposition for different segments (how will they benefit from this new way of listening) as well as a new operating model, defining governance roles and procedures to ensure a smooth integration of Continuous Listening into business as usual. Therefore, look for a partner who can help you to manage that change and make sure Continuous Listening gets successfully adopted by and embedded within the organisation.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Thank you to Laura for providing her time and considerable expertise on this subject.

David R. Green,"May 23, 2018",The role of Organisational Network Analysis in People Analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/,"[<p>One of the most exciting trends in people analytics is the rapid growth of Organisational Network Analysis (ONA), which whilst not new is witnessing a resurgence thanks to developments in technology, new ways of working and changing business requirements.</p>, <p>When I meet with people analytics leaders, ONA regularly crops up in the conversation as one of the techniques that they have either already begun to use or plan to deploy within their organisations.</p>, <p>Indeed, research conducted by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> towards the end of 2017 (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below) found that ONA was the analytical technique that people analytics leaders most wanted to learn more about. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1: </em></strong><em>Organisational Network Analysis is the technique that HR &amp; People Analytics leaders most want to learn more about (Source: Insight222)</em></p>, <p>The role of ONA in people analytics was the topic of my presentation at <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> in Las Vegas in May 2018. The slides I used during my speech are included below. The purpose of this article is to answer the following questions I regularly get asked about ONA:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If you Google ‘Organisational Network Analysis’, you will uncover a lot of dry and technical descriptions of what ONA is, which are mostly a variation of “<em>Organisational Network Analysis is a structured way to visualise how communications, information and decisions flow through an organisation</em>” (which came from Deloitte).</p>, <p>I prefer <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a>’s description in his <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/peopleanalytics/michael-arena-chief-talent-officer-at-general-motors"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">excellent recent podcast</a> with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a>, where the Chief Talent Officer of GM defined ONA as providing “<em>a new lens to evaluate how people show up in an organisation.""</em></p>, <p>Similarly, in his article ‘What is ONA?’, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Professor Rob Cross</a>, arguably the world’s foremost expert on the subject, explains that “<em>ONA can provide an x-ray into the inner workings of an organisation — a powerful means of making invisible patterns of information flow and collaboration in strategically important groups visible</em>”. In the same article, Cross provides a perfect example to illustrate this viewpoint and how ONA enables you to see what is going on in a company.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em> - An example of the insights offered through ONA (Source: Rob Cross)</em></p>, <p>The example in Figure 2 is of an ONA project undertaken by Cross with the exploration and production division of a large petroleum organisation. It identifies mid-level managers critical to information flow such as Mitchell, who is the only point of contact between members of the production division and the rest of the network. It also highlights that the Senior Vice President Mares is peripheral to the network and is essentially an untapped and underutilised resource, whilst the Production team is isolated and separated from the network. None of this is visible from the rickety old org chart.</p>, <p>The way organisations work continues to shift from the traditional hierarchies and bureaucracies prevalent in the 20th Century to more agile enterprises founded upon teams and networks of teams. ONA can provide a fresh lens into how these teams and networks really collaborate and behave, and how work really gets done.</p>, <p>Moreover, ONA provides insights that can unlock innovation, drive productivity and improve performance whilst at the same time enhancing employee experience and wellness. These are all areas that are front-of-mind for CEOs and business leaders as they seek to create the climate and culture that drives competitive advantage and business success.</p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> writes <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/retain-release-data-you-need-react-correctly-when-employee-newman/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, ONA adds the dynamic of ‘Social Capital’ to the typically static ‘Human Capital’ data that HR and people analytics teams have traditionally had to rely upon. As <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below illustrates, social capital includes networks and relationships that employees build to help them get work done. These cover a diverse range of areas such as networks for expertise, innovation, social, learning, strategy and day to day work. Social capital has a big bearing on individual, team and organisational performance, which is a significant reason why interest in ONA has surged and why this is the technique that people analytics leaders most want to learn more about.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3: </em></strong><em>The importance of social capital in ascertaining employee value (Source: TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p>As highlighted earlier in this article, ONA is not new. The likes of Rob Cross have been pioneering ‘Active’ ONA for over 20 years and made significant strides in progressing the science forward.</p>, <p>What is ‘new’ is the addition of ‘Passive’ ONA, which thanks to rapid advances in technology has helped propel a renewed interest in the subject whilst in parallel expanding and advancing the field. Much of the subsequent debate seems to have centred on whether organisations should adopt an Active <u>or</u> Passive strategy, whereas as is invariably the case in either/or debates like this perhaps a combination of both approaches should be employed.</p>, <p>For the uninitiated, ‘Active’ ONA surveys enable organisations to gain an understanding of how employees (or groups of employees) feel about their colleagues, their relationships and their place within the organisation. ‘Passive’ ONA provides a different and complementary view as it runs continuously - often across the entire company. It provides an objective, unbiased view of how people are actually working and collaborating. It can also be used to automatically measure changes in network behaviours after an initiative or corporate event has taken place, such as following an M&amp;A or significant restructure.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4: </em></strong><em>Active vs. Passive ONA - data sources and key characteristics (Source: David Green)</em></p>, <p>From speaking to experts in the ONA space, I believe that combining Active and Passive ONA is the way forward. Using survey based Active ONA alone may produce great insights and results, but it can take significant investment in time and resources, is ‘point-in-time’ and at risk to low response rates. Adding Passive ONA to the mix adds scale, continuous and real-time capability. When combined, the two sets of data provide a revolutionary 360-degree view both to understand how people feel <u>and</u> what they do.</p>, <p>When I spoke to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/manishgoelts/"" target=""_blank"">Manish Goel</a>, CEO of TrustSphere, about this he confirmed that many of his customers are using both active and passive data sources. As an example, TrustSphere customers that have deployed ONA to improve leadership development are using “<em>Active surveys to identify those key leaders who exhibit the types of behaviours that organisations are looking to replicate. Passive ONA is then used to continually measure these behaviours in the long run and measure the ongoing impact that these leaders have on their teams and their wider informal networks. This creates an array of insights and coachable moments that were previously invisible.”</em></p>, <p>Whether you decide to use active, passive or both one big consideration is around privacy, not least with the advent of GDPR, which if you needed reminding comes into force on 25 May 2018. As with any people analytics project – and particularly with regards to using passive data sources such as email metadata, this means clear communication with employees (what data do you want to use, for what purpose and what is the benefit to employees), working closely with legal, IT and employee representative groups and establishing clear governance around data collection, access and storage, communication, opt in/out, anonymity etc.</p>, <p>As interest and adoption of ONA continues to rise so the vendors operating within the space also diversifies and expands. As I am regularly asked who these vendors are, I thought it would be helpful to provide a summary (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>). I have grouped 14 vendors into those operating either in the 'Active' (primarily survey based) or 'Passive' (e.g. email/calendar meta data, in/external social media and collaboration platforms, wearables etc) spaces - with two vendors identifying themselves as operating in both. At this point it's important to say that it is not necessarily a case of either Active or Passive as the best solution could very well be a combination of the two.  </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: The Vendors driving innovation in the ONA field (Source: David Green)</em></p>, <p>Firstly, let’s bust the myth that ONA is all about pretty network visualisations solely for the purpose of highlighting the key influencers within an organisation. Whilst it does help you identify positive and negative agents of change within your company, ONA is no one trick pony.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below highlights a sample of use cases for ONA in an organisation – there are many more. A later article will go into more depth about each of these use cases and others. The key premise here – as with any people analytics project, is to start with the business question and look to apply ONA where appropriate to help you identify actionable insights.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6: </em></strong><em>Examples of ONA use cases (Source: David Green)  </em></p>, <p>This is a question I am often asked, which not only provides evidence of the huge interest in ONA but also that the technique (at least when it comes to passive) is relatively new. There are plenty of case studies available if you look closely enough – particularly in the active category (check out the articles by Rob Cross on LinkedIn <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/detail/recent-activity/posts/"" target=""_blank"">here</a> as an example). When it comes to examples in the passive space most are currently provided by vendors, but I expect this to change as the practice matures and organisations feel ready to share their stories.</p>, <p>Four case studies are provided below:</p>, <p>One of the most powerful examples of ONA is how GM used it to stimulate innovation and effectively disrupt themselves from the inside. The case study and the academic research behind it is documented in the wonderful MITSMR article <a href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-catalyze-innovation-in-your-organization/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">How to Catalyse Innovation in Your Organisation</a>, which was co-written by amongst others Rob Cross and Michael Arena.</p>, <p>The article outlines the different roles brokers, connectors and energisers (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong>) play in a network in discovering, developing and diffusing innovation within an organisation and essentially how to disrupt from the inside.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong><em>: How to catalyse innovation within your organisation (Source: MIT Sloan Management Review)</em> By analysing the connections between employees GM was able to determine how to bring together the people most likely to have the highest impact on innovation and product design to work together on projects and teams. They then used a variety of methods to help create the environment most conducive for ideas to be created and shared, which is known as the ‘Adaptive Space’ (which is also the title of Michael Arena’s <a href=""https://www.adaptivespace.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">new book</a>).</p>, <p>The MITSMR article outlines the methods GM used once it had identified and brought together the group of employees. This included:</p>, <p>This process, which let’s remind ourselves again was initiated by HR, has enabled GM to launch innovative products such as Maven and Book by Cadiliac, as well as initiate a new process to improve buyer-supplier relationships.</p>, <p>A common criticism of leadership development programs is that evaluating impact can be challenging as changes in the behaviour of participants is often subtle, invisible and hard to quantify. This example of how <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> worked in unison with a provider delivering a leadership development program to R&amp;D teams in five countries of a Fortune 100 consumer goods company illustrates how ONA can help shine a new light on this evaluation process.</p>, <p>Elements of the program included development areas for participants in key areas of leadership such as their network strength and reach, their influence, their leadership style and how they and their teams communicate and collaborate together and with the rest of the business.</p>, <p>TrustSphere worked with the provider delivering the program and the organisation itself to evaluate participants before the program began and then at two-month intervals during the eight-month program so delegates and the trainer could evaluate progress and identify areas for further development personalised to each participant of the program. <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong> below provides an example of the report provided to participants throughout the program and the elements covered. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 8: </em></strong><em>Using ONA to measure and accelerate the impact of a leadership development program (Source: TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p>The impact of the initiative has been significant, including evidence of measurable behavioural change by participants. Providing objective data about their own networks resulted in participants proactively building these networks across the organisation over the course of the program. TrustSphere’s network analysis acted as a “mirror” which helped participants reduce bias and use data to understand where to spend time building and enhancing their key relationships across the organisation.</p>, <p>The reports were considered so valuable by participants and the program considered so useful by the company, that there are now plans to expand the service to broader groups across the company.</p>, <p>A key next step of evaluation will also be to look at the impact of the initiative on the business such as whether the speed, quality and financial impact of R&amp;D innovation has improved.</p>, <p>Read more on this case study in Greg Newman's recent article: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/using-organizational-network-analytics-ona-measure-impact-greg-newman/"" target=""_blank"">Using Organizational Network Analytics (ONA) to measure the impact of Leadership Development</a></p>, <p>Like Rob Cross, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> is an invaluable resource for articles and case studies on ONA and people analytics. The video below and <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/mapping-employee-interactions-reveals-networks/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">accompanying article</a> in re:Work recounts an example of when Ben’s company <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a> conducted an analysis of the differing branch performances of a European retail bank.</p>, <p>As Ben describes, despite employees in each branch having the same training and similar demographics, performance was very different. Humanyze used their digital badges to test whether there was a correlation between network strength and branch performance. The results were illuminating. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the highest-performing branches had the most cohesive, interconnected social networks.</p>, <p>The results for lower-performing branches were more interesting. In one example, new hires were being excluded from what was a tightly-knit employee group, which led to a program to better integrate new hires being implemented. Whilst another example, saw two distinct networks within a branch – one on the first floor, the other on the second. Despite it taking only a matter of seconds to walk from one floor to another, the study suggested no one did it. As a result of this insight, the bank shifted away from multilevel branches where they could and rotated desks more frequently elsewhere.</p>, <p>The impact on the bottom line was impressive. A/B testing saw the 50% of branches where the new procedures were implemented enjoying an increase in loan sales of 11% compared to the branches where nothing was changed.</p>, <p>Microsoft acquired VoloMetrix back in 2015 and have since integrated what is now known as <a href=""https://products.office.com/en-us/business/workplace-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Workplace Analytics</a> into its Office 365 suite. In <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/managers-like-box-chocolates-dawn-klinghoffer/"" target=""_blank"">this article</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> who leads the people analytics function at Microsoft, describes how they ran a project that combined data from Workplace Analytics (email and calendar meta data, not content) with engagement and business data to better understand manager effectiveness.</p>, <p>The key findings, which are described by Dawn in the article and summarised in <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong> below, in part validated hypotheses that Microsoft had long believed but also contained some unexpected results too.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 9: </em></strong><em>Using ONA to measure manager effectiveness (Source: Dawn Klinghoffer)</em></p>, <p>As Dawn outlines in her article, the insights the project revealed are helping Microsoft develop guiding principles and coaching programs for managers that drive team engagement and business performance. This is another example of how ONA can reveal hitherto hidden insights that can be used to improve productivity and employee experience.</p>, <p>There’s a wealth of articles and case studies available on ONA, which illustrates the sheer breadth of what can be achieved. A selection of resources is provided below. Please feel free to suggest additional resources and particularly case studies in the comments section of this article:</p>, <p>Given the possibilities offered through ONA, it is hardly surprising that interest levels are so high and that organisations are increasingly embarking on people analytics projects that include at least an element of ONA – whether it is active, passive or both. I expect this trend to continue and look forward to sharing more great work in this space as the field continues to mature.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>My interest in ONA is being sated through my recent appointment as a Board Advisor at TrustSphere. I’d like to thank Manish Goel, Greg Newman and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyabagga/"" target=""_blank"">Priya Bagga</a> for their support in writing this article.</p>, <p>Thanks also to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kat-khramova-b8597549/"" target=""_blank"">Kat Khramova</a> of UNLEASH for asking me to prepare a speech to ‘demystify ONA’ for the Las Vegas show. It forced me to learn more about a topic that had already become a passion.</p>, <p>Finally, thank you to the other speakers I had the privilege of introducing on the Smart Data breakout at UNLEASH: Charlotte Nagy, Daniel Morales, Madelyn Torres Nichols, Chris Louie, Daniel Shapero, Todd Horton, Lexy Martin, Gary Blake, Christopher Eamiguel, Sheri Feinzig, Mary Ellen Slayter and Jason Pagan.

David R. Green,"May 10, 2018",People Analytics in Asia Pacific: Why is it different?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-asia-pacific-why-different-david-green/,"[<p>The recent 2018 Global Human Capital Trends report from Deloitte highlighted the rising importance of people data and analytics to organisations in Asia Pacific. <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below highlights the top 10 trends in the APAC region, with People Data ranking as the fourth most important trend (it ranked second globally). The study shows that 89% of respondents (the global figure was 85%) believe that people data is important or very important, but that only 38% (42% globally) believe that their organisations are ready or very ready in this category.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: The top 10 trends in the Asia Pacific region highlighted in Deloitte's 2018 Global Human Capital Trends report by importance and readiness (Source: Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends, 2018)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>From speaking to people in the HR Analytics community in Asia Pacific, it is clear that the challenges around building and sustaining capability with regards to people analytics are different to those in Europe and North America, and also vary considerably across a region that is home to 65% of the world's population.</p>, <p>This article, which is part of a series focused on people analytics in Asia Pacific that will be published during the course of 2018, explores the main differences. It is equally intended to provide guidance to global organisations with operations in the APAC region as well as Asia Pacific based organisations themselves seeking to capitalise on the many benefits – both to the business <u>and</u> employees – offered by people analytics and a more data-driven approach to HR.</p>, <p>The series of articles is a collaboration with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arun-sundar-2290237/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Sundar</a>, Chief Strategy Officer of TrustSphere, who as well as providing an explanation of the differences associated with practicing people analytics in Asia, will also invite comment from other experts in the people analytics community in the region.

Arun and I would like to thank each of you for your invaluable contributions to this article.  </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I split my time doing a few things that I am passionate about. These activities include evangelising and actively getting involved to help shape the potential impact that technology could have for the ‘greater common good’. Platforms like the <a href=""http://asiacloudcomputing.org/aboutus/sigs/18-contents/326-aaa-acca"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Asia Analytics Alliance</a> where I am Chairman, and various organisations, technology ventures and initiatives which I am involved in help me to do that. I am also one of the management team members of <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> where I am the Chief Strategy Officer. In addition, I am also an avid evangelist of ‘Social Capital’ thinking (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below) for which I created the <a href=""http://www.thesocialcapitalinstitute.org/about-us.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Social Capital Institute</a>. </p>, <p><em>Figure 2: The importance of social capital in ascertaining employee value (Source: TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Good question David, fortunately, they are! I am a huge believer in Social Capital, which I define as the value that is derived from the relationships an individual has. I believe that Social Capital is the currency that will propel the evolution of the human race moving forward. However, the world at large doesn’t seem to appreciate and leverage this ‘invisible’ force. If it did, I believe that Social Capital would have a substantial positive impact across all walks of life. To evangelise this thinking, I founded the Social Capital Institute with a few other ‘believers’. Analytics is complementary as it helps us uncover the ‘invisible’, which again if done well has an extraordinarily positive impact to people and communities at large. Nevertheless, its understanding and evolution needs a closer involvement of the entire eco-system. To enable this, I founded the Asia Analytics Alliance as a special interest group within the non-profit Asia Cloud Computing where I am a board member. TrustSphere interestingly is an intersection of both social capital and analytics, as our technology helps organisations leverage the collective strength of their social capital. I feel extremely fortunate to have my passion meeting my profession.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Any technology should ultimately cater to the ‘greater common good’ of people. Understanding and leveraging the drivers ‘of’ people ‘for’ the people has a profound impact here. However, it cannot be done purely ‘by’ people given the scale and diversity of data, this is where people analytics becomes important and interesting.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There has been significant interest in the discipline of People Analytics in Asia, which is heartening because two-thirds of the world’s population lives here. Most organisations, above a certain employee size and revenue have already invested or are seriously considering investing in people analytics (they might call it by a different name though including ‘HR Analytics’ or ‘Workforce Analytics’ amongst numerous others). These companies see it as a source of competitive advantage even if most are still short of forming a strategy, technology and process around it. Fortunately, in most cases, the region is more optimistic and impatient about the results they expect to achieve and are less aware of the complexities that the journey may require. Typical obstacles that need to be overcome include the level of HR maturity and influence, constraints on investment as well as a lack of understanding of what analytics can do. While the buzz around People Analytics is rising in the APAC region, the ‘journey of adoption’ has to be substantially different compared to the rest of the world. This is because people in the east are significantly different to people in the west: their culture, history and legacy are very different.</p>, <p>In my experience here in Asia, I have seen some forward-thinking companies circumvent these challenges in the most admirable fashion. One common trait that I have seen in all of these companies is they have a ‘champion’ leader who understands Asia’s nuances and appreciates the value of contextual People Analytics. Some of the smartest leaders whom I have had the benefit of interacting with in close quarters have been kind enough to share with me some noteworthy insights from their experience in the Asian region.</p>, <p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><strong>Nick Sutcliffe</strong> is the Managing Director, Asia-Pacific and India at The Conference Board. He leads The Conference Board’s Human Capital research projects across the region. He has co-published research reports on leadership, talent development and human capital practice, with specific focus on Asia.</p>, <p><em>""The Workforce Analytics Institute was established in Asia as it is probably the hardest place to undertake analytics studies owing to the diverse nature of the region, the differing levels of economic maturity and multiple human capital management systems in place. Having said that, these challenges also represent opportunities as it has forced organisations to not just consider the internal drivers but also the external drivers including the macro economic outlook, the demographics and future consumer demand.</em></p>, <p><em>Having partnered with businesses throughout the region we have seen centres of excellence in terms of driving productivity, predictive analytics around talent acquisition and retention and the development of strategic workforce planning in particular with regards to the future of work and critical roles. One of the most unique analytics studies I have been involved in included the mapping out of future consumer demand in 200+ cities across China and using this data to focus on talent acquisition outside of the traditional tier 1 cities. The premise being consumer hotspots are driven by a strong business outlook and in turn represent talent hotspots. This project allowed our client to shift focus and direction in attracting new talent.</em></p>, <p><em>In terms of the future Asia will continue to harness and develop analytical skills, if anything to primarily meet and support future business growth.""</em></p>, <p><strong>Jayesh Menon </strong>has led numerous data-driven practices across companies in Asia. At present he is the HR Director at Moet Hennessy Asia Pacific where he holds both regional and global responsibility to drive technology enabled and data-driven decisions with regards to talent:</p>, <p><em>""One of the biggest beneficiaries of People Analytics should be Asia especially if the organisation’s HQ is located outside the region. It is easier to pilot some projects in the region for two critical reasons: 1) The region has a strong millennial workforce with a very large appetite for technology and, 2) Being located away from the corporate HQ invariably means that an experiment or pilot here does not 'upset the apple cart' and can be managed without too much risk. People analytics will also help break a few myths starting from what we keep hearing as an “Asia Pacific strategy” as the region is not homogenous. It will also help showcase the diversity of the demographics and culture of the region and hence help CXO’s to better appreciate and understand why some of the people practices in the region require a different approach.""</em></p>, <p><strong>Junko Owada</strong> is an Evangelist at the People Analytics Lab for Hitachi. She is passionate about the use of data for people decisions and has an authentic and hands-on view of the People Analytics journey in Japan</p>, <p><em>""One of the biggest challenges for People Analytics in Japan is that public data about people is limited. This is due to the culture in Japan where senior and talented people don’t reveal their experience and knowledge on social media platforms such as LinkedIn or upload resumes. Data sources are myriad and sporadic making the critical stage of data collection challenging. Doing data analysis also has its unique trials in Japan, this includes the inability to use text mining algorithms that are developed for the English language and consequently do not work for the Japanese language.""</em></p>, <p><strong>Alexis Saussinan</strong> is the Global Head of Organization Development and Analytics at Merck Group. In his current role at Merck and in previous companies, Alexis has focussed on driving global business, culture and organisational change through organisation analytics as well as enhanced business decision making through AI and predictive modelling.</p>, <p><em>""At Merck, we have experienced high growth in Asia over the last years. Asia is diverse, and hence we approach each country and business with specific insights and solutions, sometimes using Asia to pilot and/or test new ideas related to People Analytics and organisational development.""</em></p>, <p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>Drivers are a rendition of culture and values. The East is starkly different from the West in this facet. If you look at it broadly, traditionally in the east, communitarian values abound where the interests of society take precedence over that of the individual. This has implications on the difference in the behaviour and culture of employees as well as those responsible for deciding and executing the projects in the region. This in-turn changes the ‘what’ and the ‘how’ of people analytics in Asia compared to the West. For example, an analytics project to ‘understand and optimise leadership behaviour’ will not be regarded as a priority in a traditional Asian organisation. This can be attributed to the power distance and often excessive belief in a 'leader’s wisdom' more than data. Nevertheless, this scenario is starting to change with more cross-cultural exposure and ‘liberal’ Gen Y coming into the workforce whose priorities are different, which is making it an interesting concoction of priorities. For example, ‘wellness’ is a very high priority topic for Gen Y whilst the decision makers and business leaders typically still belong to the traditional thought process where their focus is on use cases that are more holistic and team/community driven as opposed to being focused on the individual.</p>, <p>In the words of Junko Owada:</p>, <p><em>""Enhancing productivity and ensuring work life balance are areas where the use of People Analytics is of immense interest amongst Japanese companies. However, we are still struggling to get a consistent definition of productivity and work life balance in Japan"". </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The differences are many and vary with each sub-region in Asia, which makes it even more complicated. Every country and every sub-region is different. A simplified frame-work to ‘start’ making sense of this difference would be to have a consideration that analytics basically has the following four phases as shown below in <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>:</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: A four-phase framework for people analytics (Source: Arun Sundar, Dipti Gulati, TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p>Each country in Asia is at a different stage and hence requires a different approach when embarking on the People Analytics journey.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Take 'Data Creation' for example: the population sizes in the region create massive amounts of data. Data is a product of people and people a product of culture. The type and scale of data that gets generated therefore will have a flavour of culture. Take the example of a data structure that captures the extent of 'conversation data' between a group of people. This data-structure will find more datasets in an extrovert culture versus an introvert one.</p>, <p>When it comes to ‘Data Collection’, whilst companies in Asia have a strong awareness of the importance and value of the data they collect, uninterrupted and ubiquitous sharing of this data differs by region and technology maturity. A region like Indonesia will compare starkly low to Singapore in certain cases, for example when capturing enterprise communication data, despite the population sizes being drastically higher in the former - as employees in Indonesian companies typically use a lot of personal email ids for business communication.</p>, <p>‘Assimilation and Interpretation’ is the layer where People Analytics leaders need to be most mindful of culture. For example while deriving an insight on 'employee wellness' from a data set it is important to understand that each sub-region in Asia Pacific looks at it differently. In South Korea and Japan, research demonstrates that the traditional culture is to work long hours, in others like Singapore it is a mix of ‘hard and smart’ work which is mostly aspired to. In countries like Australia active work-life balance is more appreciated.</p>, <p>The final stage of ‘Consumption of Analytics’ also varies with region. Factors like the extent of hierarchical pedagogy, power distance, generational biases and treatment of social capital versus human capital are examples of the types of nuances that practitioners need to be mindful of.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>People Analytics in the west starts with the lens of human capital, meaning the empowerment of the ‘human’. In the east this lens has to be that of ‘Social Capital’, one has to be mindful of the communities. Even though I believe Social Capital is the primary driving currency across the world, its explicit rendition is stronger in the East.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Thanks to Arun, as well as Nick, Jayesh, Junko and Alexis for sharing their knowledge and insights in this article.

Deloitte’s <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">2018 Global Human Capital Trends</a> survey was published at the beginning of the month and reported that 85 percent of respondents (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below) viewed people analytics as important or very important, making it the joint first ranked trend in terms of importance (a surge from being ranked eighth in 2017).</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>: <em>The top 10 trends highlighted in Deloitte's 2018 Global Human Capital Trends report by importance and readiness (Source: Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends, 2018)</em></p>, <p>This sea change in the level of importance attributed to people analytics was also obvious at the <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> conference, I chaired in London in April. As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> writes in one of the articles below, the focus of the presentations at the conference were centred on the business (and employee) value of people analytics. This shift is a sign that the field is maturing and importantly gaining in confidence as it is only through quantifying business value that the discipline will continue to thrive, gain investment and become a core component not just of HR but of executive decision making.</p>, <p>The progress of the field and its increasing importance to organisations and the future of HR is also reflected in the articles, podcasts and videos I have selected this month, which kicks off deservedly with:</p>, <p>As usual Deloitte’s aforementioned Global Human Capital Trends report is well worth all the hype and anticipation associated with it. The headline finding in the 2018 report is the rapid rise of the social enterprise, which the report defines as reflecting the “<em>growing importance of social capital in shaping an organisation’s purpose, guiding its relationships with stakeholders, and in influencing its ultimate success or failure</em>”. The entire 102 page report is an absorbing read, but the people analytics chapter is particularly fascinating. Titled ‘<em>People data: How far is too far’</em>, the authors describe the rapid growth of the field, the increase in the number and type of data sources being used, and the consequent risk this poses to privacy and data security. The article highlights a potential blind spot (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>), where whilst organisations are actively managing the risks of using people data around employee perceptions and legal liability, only a quarter are managing the potential impact on their consumer brand. Ethics is arguably the most important part of people analytics and the biggest risk to its progress - the findings in the report only go to reinforce this.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 2</em></strong><em>: When it comes to using people data, organisations are actively managing risks around employee perceptions and legal liability, but only a quarter are managing the potential impact on their consumer brand (Source: Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Writing in Talent Economy, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> underlines the unprecedented change work is undergoing, and the extent to which this will revolutionise the capabilities HR needs to consequently develop in the coming years. Keith describes the evolution of HR, from 1.0 (predominantly focused on administration and industrial relations) to 2.0 (business partner, use of data restricted to reporting), and then argues that HR now needs to shift to 3.0. This third version of HR, as Keith explains, requires a more strategic focus in three ways: i) people analytics will be at HR’s core, ii) the HR function will be more agile and efficient, and iii) HR professionals will need to have better business acumen and possess problem-solving skills. An insightful and inspiring article, and one to read alongside <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a>’s reappraisal of his infamous business partner model. As Ulrich explains he has written numerous books and delivered countless talks since 1997 (when the original model was published) on how HR is not about HR but about delivering value to multiple stakeholders. This puts the ridiculous criticism of his original model into the right context as Ulrich can hardly be blamed for the inability of organisations to evolve a model he first published over 20 years ago. The article provides a table of 13 pivots in the 2.0 model including <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>, which summarises the requirements when it comes to analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 3 </em></strong><em>– Extract from 13 pivots required in the HR Business Partner 2.0 model - HR Analytics (Source: Dave Ulrich) </em><strong><em>  </em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> is the most prolific and arguably best commentator around on how technology, analytics and data will impact the future of work and our everyday lives. Bernard launched his new book <a href=""https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1297"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘Data-Driven HR’</a> at People Analytics World and has been serialising some of the content in his Forbes column. Two examples are provided here. First, Bernard outlines why data is probably the greatest asset HR has, whilst the second article describes three ways HR teams can use data, to: i) make better business decisions, ii) better understand employees and iii) improve HR operations. The articles are an excellent taster for the book, which I highly recommend anyone interested in increasing the impact of HR in their organisation should read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The first of two entries this month by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> was inspired by the Tucana <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> conference I had the pleasure of chairing in London on 11/12 April. As someone who attended the first People Analytics World in 2014, Andrew is ideally positioned to describe how the conversation has shifted from whether companies should even do people analytics in 2014 to the dominant discussion this year on deriving business value. Andrew then describes two cases presented at the show by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelctocci/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Tocci</a> (P&amp;G) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/swati-chawla-8b10445/"" target=""_blank"">Swati Chawla</a> (Syngenta), which whilst not the most sophisticated or complex solutions provided real and quantifiable business value. Andrew’s article was just one of many inspired by People Analytics World including others penned by Michael Carty (<a href=""https://www.xperthr.com/people-analytics/2018/04/17/paworld18-people-analytics-to-drive-employee-engagement-and-retention/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), Caroline Styr (<a href=""http://www.futureofwork.com/article/people-analytics-beyond-hr"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and Littal Shemar Haim (<a href=""http://www.littalshemerhaim.com/key-takeaways-from-people-analytics-world-london-2018-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It’s terrific that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers/"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> is writing again, not only because he is one of the most knowledgeable people in our space but because the <a href=""https://www.inostix.com/blog/en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix blog</a> is an absolute treasure trove of articles on people analytics stretching all the way back to 2011. In this article, Luk issues a rallying cry that people analytics teams need to break out of the ‘dark room of HR’ and seek cross-functional learning and collaboration opportunities. This, Luk contests, will help raise the profile, impact and influence of people analytics to the business. He then outlines five lessons HR can learn from marketing about the use of data and analytics and how these can be used to inform decisions. Welcome back Luk, and happy fifth anniversary too to you and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> on five years of iNostix and ABN AMRO working together!</p>, <p><em>Patrick Coolen and Luk Smeyers pictured at People Analytics World to mark the fifth anniversary of the partnership between ABN AMRO and iNostix</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst Luk has been on his writing sabbatical, his iNostix colleague <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a> has taken up the mantle and written a series of superb articles centred on the role of people analytics in designing, measuring and deriving benefit from employee experience. This article, which provides four guiding principles to a successful continuous listening program – see the ‘4 C’s of Continuous Listening’ model in <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> below - may well be her best yet. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 4: </em></strong><em>The 4 C's of Continuous Listening (Source: Laura Stevens, iNostix by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I featured two of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-mcpherson-0497209/"" target=""_blank"">Jason McPherson</a>’s articles last month, and <a href=""https://www.cultureamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Culture Amp</a>’s Chief Scientist gets his hat-trick in this excellent guide on how to link data from people surveys to broader business outcomes. Linking employee feedback to business outcomes can be complex, so Jason’s advice “<em>to be realistic and understand that some things are potentially outside the sphere of what you can measure or model</em>” should be noted. Jason then offers some tips on how to get started with linkage, which includes his recommendation to start small with something where you have confidence that there is a connection and where you have a reasonable level of control over the inputs. Watch the video below and then read Jason’s article.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Next, two articles on ONA. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/suvarna-joshi-4823456b/"" target=""_blank"">Suvarna Joshi</a> describes four examples of how passive ONA can provide fresh sets of data to help organisations measure the impact of diversity and inclusion. These include i) Understanding gender differences in networking behaviour, ii) Measuring inclusion of diverse groups, and; iii) Identifying hidden stars (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>).</p>, <p>One of the criticisms I’ve heard levied at ONA is that whilst the theory sounds great and the network graphs look wonderful, there aren’t enough quantifiable case studies that demonstrate business value. Au contraire. There are case studies if you take the time to find them such as the second article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a> on how Ramco deployed <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a>’s ONA solution to improve sales effectiveness, reduce time-to-productivity of new hires and reduce attrition.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 5 – </em></strong><em>Using passive ONA to identify a HiPO trainee vs. an average trainee (Source: Suvarna Joshi, TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I always enjoy <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a>'s thought provoking articles on people analytics, and his latest effort is no exception. Morten explains why psychological knowledge is essential to success in people analytics and why it should be a core component of the ‘Superhero’ team (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> Below). Morten then uses the example of a recruiting algorithm to highlight the importance of effort justification, a well-known element in social psychology, to support his argument that psychological skills are even more important than statistical capabilities when it comes to people analytics.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 6: </em></strong><em>The skills required in a People Analytics team of superheroes (Source: Morten Kamp Andersen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Unless you happen to be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rip van Winkle</a>, you’ll be fully aware of the considerable hype over ‘AI in HR’, but is it real or are we being seduced by a pack of vendor wolves in woollen jumpers? This collection of five articles offers a gamut of views. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> cuts through the hype and offers a sensible analysis of what is currently possible with AI, which perhaps unsurprisingly isn’t quite what many vendors are claiming. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomredman/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Redman</a> tackles a fundamental capability required to do machine learning – good quality data: first in the historical data used to train the predictive model, and second in the new data used by that model to make future decisions. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisdebrusk/"" target=""_blank"">Chris DeBrusk</a> looks at perhaps one of the biggest risks to technologies built on machine learning – biased data, before providing guidance on how this can be mitigated. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laetitia-vitaud-1058ba82/"" target=""_blank"">Laetitia Vitaud</a>’s article adopts a more positive stance and looks at the possibilities AI offers HR to personalise the services it offers to employees. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeannemeister/"" target=""_blank"">Jeanne Meister</a>’s article in Forbes provides two examples from Marriott and Hilton of how they harnessed machine learning to improve candidate and employee experience respectively.     </p>, <p>April saw a plethora of must-listen podcasts on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work. Here are my favourite five. Firstly, it’s always good to listen to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a> speak about people analytics and his conversation with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a> is as stimulating as it is comprehensive. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> outlines his concept of systems thinking to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, and how this approach can help realise the full potential of people analytics. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> talks to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariannahuffington/"" target=""_blank"">Arianna Huffington</a> on his WorkLife podcast about the dangers of letting work and technology take over our lives. The always listenable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattalder/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Alder</a>’s guest on the excellent Recruiting Future podcast, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/robmccargow/"" target=""_blank"">Rob McCargow</a>, provides a quite brilliant analysis of AI – cutting through the hype, providing examples of use cases and discussing the very real dangers of biased data. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> continues his excellent series of talking to some of the most innovative vendors in our space, in his discussion with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-weiner-4843a08/"" target=""_blank"">Sara Weiner</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/shane-combest-3212b45a/"" target=""_blank"">Shane Combest</a> of <a href=""https://www.glintinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glint</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As one of the main authors of the Global Human Capital Trends report and arguably the most recognised and influential authority on the HR discipline in the world, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> is one of the biggest draws on the conference circuit (he is one of the headline speakers at <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/america/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> in Las Vegas on 15-16 May). Josh probably delivers more insights per minute than any other speaker, so if you get distracted in the conference hall even for a second, you’ve likely missed something really important. So, the opportunity to watch Josh speak on video armed with pause and rewind buttons is unmissable! The video below shows Josh speaking at the <a href=""https://www.hrdsummit.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRD Summit</a> in the UK in February 2018 on the five mandates for HR in the coming years and how the function can best provide value to leaders and employees alike.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As referenced at the outset of this piece, April was a busy as well as a momentous one for me. I had the good fortune of being the chair of the fifth (and best yet) edition of <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> in London. The week after I delivered the opening keynote and co-ran a masterclass with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> at the <a href=""http://peopleanalyticsforum.eu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR &amp; People Analytics Forum</a> in Budapest, which as well as seeing a mix of local and international speakers made it clear that people analytics as a discipline is making strides in Eastern Europe too. Thank you to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/barryswales/"" target=""_blank"">Barry Swales</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gorank/"" target=""_blank"">Goran Krstulovic</a> for inviting me to chair and speak at your events.</p>, <p>May is also shaping up to be a good month, with the centrepiece being <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/america/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the UNLEASH show in Las Vegas</a> where I’ll be moderating the Smart Data track and also speaking about ‘The Role of ONA in People Analytics’.

David R. Green,"April 25, 2018",Three reasons I've joined Insight222 as a board advisor,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-reasons-ive-joined-insight222-board-advisor-david-green/,"[<p><em>“Turn and face the strange, Ch- Ch- Changes…” (David Bowie)</em></p>, <p>Truly special opportunities come about maybe once in a lifetime. If you are able to fulfil your passion, work with exceptional people, and contribute to driving real change and progress in your chosen field then you simply must grab such an opportunity with both hands.</p>, <p>This is why I am so thrilled to be invited by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> to become a Non-Executive Director (see <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/announcements/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">announcement</a> by Co-Founder and CEO, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>).</p>, <p>Here are three reasons why I took this opportunity:</p>, <p>Insight222’s mission - <em>To put People Analytics, as a discipline, at the centre of Business -</em> aligns directly with my own raison d’être. We simply must make our workplaces more humane. In his new book, ‘<a href=""https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/dying-paycheck"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dying for a Paycheck</a>’, Jeffrey Pfeffer, Professor of Organizational Behaviour at Stanford University provides a damning indictment on the 21st century workplace. Pfeffer provides evidence on how  modern management practices propagate stress, diminish engagement, destroy the mental and physical health of employees, and ultimately damage company performance. This is why I believe that people analytics is so important as it can shine a light on the harm the practices highlighted by Pfeffer cause and provide actionable insights that drive organisational performance <u>and</u> employee experience and wellbeing.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.insight222.com/the-people-analytics-program"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The People Analytics Program</a> is the signature offering of Insight222’s strategy to realise its mission. The program combines tools, research, learning, expertise and consulting, and helps clients (namely Heads of People Analytics and CHROs, as well as HR professionals and practitioners) be successful in bringing increased value to their organisations. What makes Insight222 standout, and what makes it so compelling for me, is that the program is being delivered by people (see image below) who have been people analytics and HR leaders themselves. This means not only does Insight222 have a deep understanding of the challenges faced by people analytics leaders but is also able to design, facilitate and deliver solutions that can help leaders learn, create, explore and ultimately make better decisions and be more influential.  Moreover, advising Insight222 will help me in my mission to play a role in developing the wider people analytics and entire global HR community and profession too.</p>, <p>Networking on its own is not enough. It’s one thing to meet up with your peers a few times a year and exchange a few emails. It’s quite another to actually do work with them. This is what makes Insight222 and The People Analytics Program so unique. Since launching in the second half of 2017, Insight222 has already signed up over 25 member organisations in Europe and North America. Together these represent some of the largest companies and most advanced people analytics teams in the world. Insight222 works with them to harness the collective intelligence in the group, identify common challenges and then facilitates the co-creation of initiatives to meet these needs. For example, the current co-creation project is to develop an Ethics Charter to answer the collective premise of “<em>How might HR build trust that People Analytics work will benefit and not harm our employees, and still ensure business value and impact</em>”. </p>, <p>If you are a people analytics leader and want to find out more about The People Analytics Program, explore the Insight222 <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, watch the video below featuring <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardrosenow/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Rosenow</a> (Facebook), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetanjali-gamel-17209b68/"" target=""_blank"">Geetanjali Gamel</a> (Merck &amp; Co), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/steffen-riesenbeck-22b509ab/"" target=""_blank"">Steffen Riesenbeck</a> (Bosch), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-deneau-36b9201/"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Deneau</a> (Intuit) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> and/or get in touch with me at <a href=""http://mailto:david.green@insight222.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">david.green@insight222.com</a>. </p>, <p><em>David Green is a globally respected speaker, advisor and executive consultant on People Analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

This is also my first week since leaving IBM and deciding to go solo, with today marking the official launch of my personal website – <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">davidrgreen.com</a>.</p>, <p>Since updating my LinkedIn profile last week, I’ve been humbled by the kind words of support and encouragement I’ve received. I am truly grateful.</p>, <p>So, why am I leaving IBM and what am I going to do next?</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The first thing to stress is I am not leaving because of IBM. It remains one of the world’s most iconic and innovative companies. I have enjoyed my time at IBM. I’ve learnt a lot and relished the opportunity to work with so many passionate, dedicated and super-smart colleagues.</p>, <p>As a company, IBM is one of the pioneers in data-driven HR and people analytics. It is also leading the way with regards to co-creating the employee experience as this recent <a href=""https://hbr.org/2018/03/the-new-rules-of-talent-management#co-creating-the-employee-experience"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HBR interview</a> with CHRO Diane Gherson testifies.</p>, <p>Most importantly, I feel privileged to have worked alongside Sheri Feinzig, Nigel Guenole, Louise Raisbeck and Haiyan Zhang in the <a href=""https://www-01.ibm.com/software/smarterworkforce/institute/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">IBM Smarter Workforce Institute</a>.

It’s exciting as it is daunting, but I believe that by spreading my wings and leaving the nest, I can have more impact in helping the continued growth of people analytics and the subsequent evolution and digitisation of the HR function. We simply must make our workplaces more humane.

My article <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dont-forget-h-hr-ethics-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Don’t Forget the ‘H’ in HR</a>, which highlights research and case studies in this area before outlining recommendations for people analytics teams is hopefully a helpful addition to resources about ethics and people data.

Not only do modern management practices engender stress, damage engagement and destroy the mental and physical health of employees, Pfeffer also emphasises the massive harm it causes company performance too. This is why the field of people analytics is so important as done well it can shine a light on the damage the practices outlined by Pfeffer cause organisational performance, team dynamics and individual well-being. One can only hope that business leaders around the world read Pfeffer’s book, heed his warnings, say enough is enough and reverse the damage they are causing.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I always enjoy debating the progress (or otherwise) of people analytics with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> and reading his thought provoking articles on the subject. His latest opus in HR Zone is no exception. In it Max argues that people analytics needs to step up its game if it is going to fulfil its promise, solve real business problems and help avert the damage companies are inflicting on their employees as referenced in Jeffrey Pfeffer’s aforementioned book. Max outlines a curriculum designed to improve the understanding by HR as a whole of analytics. This is the only way, Max argues, that people analytics teams can progress from projects centred on operational activities such as retention and recruitment to ones that have real impact with business leaders (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>: Linking HR and Senior General manager (SGM) perspectives: Value Profiling (Source: Max Blumberg, HR Zone)</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If you want to read thought provoking articles about people analytics, HR technology and employee engagement then you don’t need to look much further than <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a>, whose insightful commentary I have enjoyed for several years. Andrew has published a glut of excellent articles already in 2018 and this one on taking a systematic approach to selecting a suitable analytics project is no exception. Andrew outlines a number of techniques, including the ‘5 Whys’ to help uncover the real business problem. He also emphasises the need to consider at an early stage how you intend to realise value from the analysis, provides tips on developing and testing hypotheses, examines methods of collecting new data and critically how to measure success. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Touching on similar ground to Andrew Marritt, this is an excellent interview with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a>, one of the foremost practitioners in our space. Having led the people analytics teams at Maersk and Shell, Thomas is now pulling up trees at National Australia Bank.

Jason’s second effort examines the relationship between Glassdoor data and Culture Amp’s annual benchmark data it creates from the aggregate engagement the company collects from its thousands of customers. The results are fascinating (see example in <strong><em>Figure X</em></strong>) and as Jason writes point to some important trends, like the ability to use internal employee engagement data to predict how your company is perceived externally.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3: </em></strong><em>The relationship between engagement and Glassdoor ratings (Source: Jason McPherson, Culture Amp)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>March's HBR has a triumvirate of terrific articles on how tech is transforming HR under the banner of the new rules of talent management.

The study, which was written by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, also highlighted that organisations can only realise the full potential of people analytics when data-driven decision-making is embedded in the culture. As such, this article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenporttom/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Davenport</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/randy-bean-6903882/"" target=""_blank"">Randy Bean</a> is timely as it reveals only one-third of companies have succeeded in shifting to a data-driven culture. It is reassuring and perhaps scary at the same time to see that other functions in the business find it just as challenging as HR does to create the data-driven culture required for analytics to thrive.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Organisational Network Analysis is an area of people analytics that is increasingly providing a lot of coverage, and is one of the techniques people analytics leaders are most interested in finding out more about.

David R. Green,"March 19, 2018",Don't forget the 'H' in HR: Ethics & People Analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dont-forget-h-hr-ethics-people-analytics-david-green/,"[<p>I believe ethics is the most critical ingredient in people analytics. Those working in the field simply cannot afford to get it wrong. The risk to employee trust and to the reputation of the burgeoning discipline of people analytics is too high.</p>, <p>‘Ethics, Trust and People Analytics’ is the title of my presentation, which will open the Smart Data breakout at <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/news/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> in London tomorrow. It is also the subject of this article, which as well as including a copy of my slides, also features recent research by the <a href=""https://www-01.ibm.com/software/smarterworkforce/institute/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">IBM Smarter Workforce Institute</a> and <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a>.</p>, <p>Research in November 2017 from Insight222 found that 81% of HR people analytics leaders and practitioners reported that their people analytics projects were jeopardised by ethical or privacy concerns (<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: 81% of people analytics projects are jeopardised by ethics and privacy concerns (Source: </em><a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Insight222</em></a><em>)</em></p>, <p>The challenge ethics presents to people analytics leaders is set to get harder, and not just in the short-term as companies seek to comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which comes into effect in May 2018.</p>, <p>Whilst the requirement to comply with GDPR is undoubtedly high on the agenda for HR (<em>the same Insight222 study found that 53% of companies had not even started getting ready for GDPR</em>), a number of other factors are in play:</p>, <p>People analytics teams have to navigate different rules and values with regards to data privacy and usage in the countries that they operate. In certain countries, particularly in Europe, people analytics leaders need to work with local HR teams to seek and receive agreement from workers councils and employee representative groups.</p>, <p>Using traditional HR data in certain jurisdictions can be challenging enough for people analytics teams, but the situation becomes even more complex when emerging technologies and non-traditional data sources such as wearables, sensors, email and social media are taken into account. Indeed a survey by UNLEASH and the IBM Smarter Workforce Institute found that 84% of respondents believe HR urgently needs guidance on the fair use and privacy of new and emerging data sources in workforce analytics.</p>, <p>A recent example is the negative press surrounding the announcement that Amazon has been awarded patents to develop <a href=""https://www.geekwire.com/2018/amazon-wins-patents-wireless-wristbands-track-warehouse-workers/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">wireless wristbands for warehouse workers</a>. A series of media outlets queued up to lambast Amazon, conjuring up images up Big Brother to support their argument that this represented a further erosion of worker rights. This prompted Amazon to counter that the wristbands will support employee wellbeing as well as improving productivity.</p>, <p>Vendors also have a responsibility here and it is refreshing to see CEOs of people analytics technology firms such as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> of <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a> (check out Ben’s <a href=""https://www.hrexaminer.com/hrexaminer-radio-executive-conversations-episode-267-dr-ben-waber/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">podcast</a> with John Sumser) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/manishgoelts/"" target=""_blank"">Manish Goel</a> of <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> (<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/peopleanalytics/manish-goel-ceo-at-trustsphere"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">listen</a> to Manish speaking to Al Adamsen on the PAFOW podcast) playing a prominent and proactive role in the ethics debate.</p>, <p>Even with the advent of legislation like GDPR, the law simply cannot keep up with the magnitude and increasing pace of technological advance. <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>, which is taken from Deloitte’s <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">2017 Global Human Capital Trends</a>, provides a perfect illustration of the extent of the challenge. This is exacerbated by the fact that technology also outstrips desire. Employees increasingly expect a similar experience at work as they do as consumers in areas such as personalised recommendations and the ability to give and receive feedback. In contrast however, employees are typically less prepared to share the data that enables this ‘consumerisation’ with their employers than they do outside work with the likes of Facebook (although <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the recent revelations about Cambridge Analytica</a> may change a few minds there.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Technology outpaces legislation and desire (Source: 2017 Global Human Capital Trends Report, Deloitte University Press)</em></p>, <p>Judging what is acceptable and what is not presents a huge dilemma for HR professionals and people analytics teams. The challenge is as much moral as it is legal. People analytics is about people after all and the risk of getting it wrong and eroding employee trust, perhaps irreversibly, means that ethics needs to be front and centre of any people analytics initiative.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>What analytics teams in HR <em>could</em> and <em>should</em> do with people data are two entirely different questions. The reality is that we are at an inflexion point where the delta between what is possible with technology and what is covered by legislation is widening. As such, a nagging question for people analytics leaders is what to do in those situations – or ‘grey areas’ – not adequately covered by legislation.</p>, <p>To find out what companies can do to inform their decisions on how to use employee data, the <a href=""https://www-01.ibm.com/software/smarterworkforce/institute/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">IBM Smarter Workforce Institute</a> surveyed more than 20,000 workers in 44 countries about their preferences regarding how data dilemmas are resolved in people analytics. The Institute clustered countries according to national preferences on how decisions regarding usage of workers’ data are made.</p>, <p><a href=""https://ibm.co/2FdgbYg"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The results</a> show that within the grey areas, where legal precedent does not exist, or where data ownership is unclear, context and culture matter most. There are important differences between cultures that may impact employees’ receptiveness to having their personal data analysed for people analytics. Even when examining countries in the same continent, the Institute sometimes observed differing dominant ideologies.</p>, <p>The research discovered most countries have dominant ethical ideologies (with 77% falling into the Absolutist ‘<em>I believe the rules are the rules</em>’ type - see<strong><em> Figure 3 </em></strong>below). This infers companies and people analytics practitioners can look to the regions where their business operates to gain a better understanding of how employees might react to an initiative to collect and analyse a new source of people data.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: In the Grey Areas, Context and Culture Matter (Source: The Grey Area – Ethical Dilemmas In HR Analytics, IBM Smarter Workforce Institute)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’m fortunate to spend much of my time working with leading experts and many of the most advanced teams in the people analytics space. Based on this knowledge and experience, <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> provides some recommendations with regards to the use of people data in HR analytics.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Recommendations on ethics in people analytics (Source: David Green, 2018)</em></p>, <p>Steps to consider here include:</p>, <p>To ensure that you are complying with the data privacy and security legislation of the countries you are operating in as well as company rules and regulations. For example, as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> writes <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-crowd-version-patrick-coolen/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, no people analytics project at ABN AMRO starts without approval from the bank’s legal and compliance teams nor are any findings communicated without sign-off.</p>, <p>To consider and prioritise potential projects is commonplace amongst the bulk of advanced people analytics teams. Ethics and privacy should be at the top of the list of items to debate by members of the council on whether to give the go-ahead to individual projects.</p>, <p>To set out how you will handle employee data, which as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> suggests <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ethics-privacy-workforce-analytics-power-people-article-ferrar/"" target=""_blank"">here</a> is even better if you co-create the code with employees</p>, <p>Whilst ensuring compliance with the GDPR will undoubtedly cause HR and people analytics teams some pain the short-term, the legislation may provide significant benefit to the discipline in the medium- to long-term. Perhaps it’s easy for me to say this as I don’t have to implement it, but I believe that the GDPR is a good piece of legislation as it essentially forces companies to put the employee front and centre when it comes to the use of people data.</p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> describes in this <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green/"" target=""_blank"">article</a> make serious consideration to having a data privacy expert as part of the people analytics team (as Dawn has done at Microsoft). This is a trend I expect to see grow over the coming years.</p>, <p>People analytics should not be a clandestine operation where employee data is collected and analysed with the insights and resultant decisions shared amongst the chosen few. Organisations should instead be open and transparent and provide clarity to employees as to what their data will be used for and how it will benefit them as well as the company. Employees should not only be able to opt in (or out), but also be empowered through being provided access to their own data. If the insights this data provides helps employees manage their careers, improve work-life balance and increase productivity this is a clear win-win for both the worker and the company.</p>, <p>Two examples of this approach are:</p>, <p>Social Pulse, IBM’s employee listening technology helps the organisation understand sentiment, detect problems and make a commitment to do something about them. A Case Study on Social Pulse and interview with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadatshami/"" target=""_blank"">Sadat Shami</a> is included on page 12 of the previously referenced <a href=""http://ibm.biz/EthicalHRAnalytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘The Grey Area: Ethical Dilemmas in HR Analytics</a>’ white paper, and is also referred to by IBM’s CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-gherson-1b93b77/"" target=""_blank"">Diane Gherson</a> in <a href=""https://hbr.org/2018/03/the-new-rules-of-talent-management#co-creating-the-employee-experience"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this interview</a> with Harvard Business Review. One notable example of the benefit to the employees of the technology came when an IBMer started an online petition about the company withdrawing permission for workers to use ride-sharing services like Uber. This led to a storm of chatter on the corporate intranet platform. Social Pulse detected the event quickly, and Diane Gherson was able to reverse the ban and communicate the decision to employees within 24 hours.</p>, <p>This <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/empower-your-employees-leverage-own-data-kathleen-hogan/"" target=""_blank"">article</a> by Microsoft’s CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a> describes how Microsoft is using analytics to empower employee decision-making by creating the ability for employees to own their data, and gain insights to help improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance.</p>, <p>Whilst it may be easier to adopt a risk-free approach to projects, this is not really an option for most people analytics teams if it wants to create sustainable impact. An element of bravery coupled with a close relationship with their legal team as well as a focus on employee benefit is required. Where a project involves the use of emerging data sources, pilots are a sensible option. For example, when Cisco was creating its Talent Cloud (see <a href=""https://www.tlnt.com/how-cisco-is-getting-to-know-each-of-its-70000-employees/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this article</a> by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jill-larsen-a700141/"" target=""_blank"">Jill Larsen</a>), they started with a small pilot, sought feedback from participants, iterated, communicated widely and then expanded the employee groups involved. In this way, not only did Cisco in effect co-create the Talent Cloud with employees but they also built momentum amongst the wider workforce that the product was as beneficial to employees (to support career development) as it was to Cisco (to drive strategic workforce planning).</p>, <p>Another terrific initiative in the realm of ethics and people analytics I became aware of last year is being led by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a>. The project sees member companies of Insight222’s <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/the-people-analytics-program"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The People Analytics Program</a> working together to co-create an Ethics Charter. The problem statement Insight222 is helping clients (who include some of the most reputable brands and advanced people analytics teams in the world) solve is: <em>“How might HR build trust that People Analytics work will benefit and not harm our employees, and still ensure business value and impact”</em>. It’s a terrific initiative and one I will watch with interest. <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below provides a high-level view of the co-creation project. For more information, please get in touch with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: Ethics Charter, The People Analytics Program (Source: Insight222)</em></p>, <p>The topic of ethics is as contentious as it is complex, and will continue to provoke much debate. People analytics leaders will continually be faced with the dilemma of what they <em>could </em>do versus what they <em>should</em> do. Perhaps the best test is this: if you cannot articulate the benefit to the employee as to why their data should be collected and analysed, then the project simply shouldn’t be undertaken. There is a ‘<em>H</em>’ in <em>HR</em> after all.</p>, <p>The following articles and research helped inform this article: Nigel Guenole, Jonathan Ferrar and Sheri Feinzig - <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Power of People</a> | IBM Smarter Workforce Institute - <a href=""http://ibm.biz/EthicalHRAnalytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Grey Area: Ethical Dilemmas in HR Analytics</a> | Deloitte University Press - <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">2017 Global Human Capital Trends</a> | Patrick Coolen – <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-crowd-version-patrick-coolen/"" target=""_blank"">The 10 Golden Rules of People Analytics (Crowd version)</a> | Jonathan Ferrar – <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ethics-privacy-workforce-analytics-power-people-article-ferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Ethics &amp; Privacy in Workforce Analytics</a> | Andrew Marritt – <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-whats-employees-andrew-marritt/"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics: What’s in it for the employees?</a> | David Green &amp; Dawn Klinghoffer – <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green/"" target=""_blank"">The HR Analytics Journey at Microsoft</a> | Dawn Klinghoffer – <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/well-balanced-people-analytics-function-dawn-klinghoffer/"" target=""_blank"">A well-balanced People Analytics function</a> | Kathleen Hogan - <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/empower-your-employees-leverage-own-data-kathleen-hogan/"" target=""_blank"">Empower your employees to leverage their own data</a> | Harvard Business Review interview with Diane Gherson – <a href=""https://hbr.org/2018/03/the-new-rules-of-talent-management#co-creating-the-employee-experience"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Co-Creating the Employee Experience at IBM</a> | Jill Larsen - <a href=""https://www.tlnt.com/how-cisco-is-getting-to-know-each-of-its-70000-employees/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">How Cisco Is Getting to Know Each of Its 70,000 Employees</a> | Al Adamsen – <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-30-al-adamsen/"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics 3.0</a> | Andy Spence - <a href=""http://www.glassbeadconsulting.com/the-quantified-workplace-technology-vs-trust/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Quantified Workplace: Technology Vs.

David R. Green,"March 5, 2018",The best HR & People Analytics articles of February 2018,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-february-2018-david-green/,"[<p>February began in the sun of San Francisco and ended in the snow of the South of England. It’s been a month of contrasts!</p>, <p>As interest in and adoption of people analytics continues to rise and as the discipline continues to broaden and deepen, the range of subjects written on people analytics continues to diversify.</p>, <p>This month’s selection of ten articles and six podcasts covers topics including: new studies on leadership and the future of work, ethics, manager effectiveness, organisational network analysis, the critical role of the analytics translator, wearables and sensors, the role of the people analytics leader and the burgeoning HR technology market amongst many others.</p>, <p>So without further ado, let’s crack on:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar/"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a> kicks off proceedings this month with his analysis of what at first glance appear to be counterintuitive findings from the <a href=""https://www.ddiworld.com/glf2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Global Leadership Forecast 2018</a>. The study, which is authored by DDI, The Conference Board and EY, highlights 25 findings about the state, context, and future of leadership. One of these findings on people analytics highlights a “<em>stunning regression</em>” from the previous study in 2014/15 with success rates dropping for every area of analytics that was compared (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>). Whilst many organisations are undoubtedly still struggling to realise the full potential of people analytics, I'm inclined to agree with Evan's view that this is ""<em>likely a case of the analytics bar rising faster than HR can leap over it</em>"". Evan’s article goes on to describe the other findings highlighted in <em>Figure 1</em> specifically the analytics practices that have the highest impact on bench strength and a financial composite of revenue growth, operating margin, EBITDA, and return on equity, before highlighting the analytics practices that have the highest impact on success.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1: </em></strong><em>A 'Stunning Regression' - comparison of success rates with analytics between the Global Leadership Forecasts 2018 with 2014/15 (Source: DDI, The Conference Board and EY) </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Ethics is arguably the most important element of people analytics and continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing practitioners. This is exacerbated due to technology – and the data it generates – moving in a direction too fast for legislation to keep up with and anticipate, and for employees and organisations to conceive. This research by the IBM Smarter Workforce saw 20,000 workers in 44 countries being surveyed for their perspective on data use in HR analytics. The results showed that within the ‘grey areas’, where legal precedent does not exist, or data ownership is unclear, context and culture matter most. A Case Study describing how IBM implemented its employee listening program Social Pulse is provided along with recommendations for organisations and employees on the use and availability of data. I’ll be presenting some of the findings from the research in the Smart Data breakout at <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/london/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH in London</a> on 20th March.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the first article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> describes a project the people analytics team at Microsoft undertook to answer that age-old question ""<em>What makes a great manager?</em>” The team combined calendar and email data with engagement and other outcome related data in order to understand the behaviours that impact outcomes. The findings helped validate some longstanding hypotheses on what impacts manager effectiveness as well as uncovering some hidden gems too. These included i) the importance of 1:1 time and feedback, ii) manager network strength and size, and; iii) limiting the number of emails sent by managers out of hours. Two of the behaviours highlighted by Dawn: Working after hours and Multitasking in meetings are analysed deeper in the second article by Ryan Fuller et al. <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> for example illustrates the impact of managers sending emails on a Sunday night.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: The impact of managers sending emails on a Sunday evening (Source: Microsoft Workplace Analytics, HBR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The articles above from Dawn Klinghoffer and Ryan Fuller et al are excellent examples of the use of passive ONA – in this case calendar and email meta data. This article, by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a>, is an example of active ONA – where the data is primarily collected through surveys. The article provides a case study of a company that needed to boost revenue both through sales and the extension of existing business. The ONA project revealed several insights that enabled the organisation to implement a series of initiatives to boost revenue. These included: recognising and rewarding ‘hidden stars’ (i.e. not just those that close the deal), replicating the collaborative behaviour of successful teams (see example in <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>) and creating more space for key revenue producers. As ever with Rob Cross’ work, this is a hugely insightful article.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>: <em>Team B has high client team connectivity with an average of seven relationships per person and was more able to service client needs, whilst Team A has two completely unconnected people and only three relationships per person on average (Source: Rob Cross)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This HBR article outlines the role of the ‘analytics translator’ whose purpose is to ‘bridge the gap’ between the insights identified by the analytics team through to the generation of business outcomes. The authors outline the skills required by translators: domain knowledge, technical fluency, project management skills and an entrepreneurial spirit. They also cite McKinsey research that predicts that by 2026, the surge in demand in the US alone for translators will reach 2-4m. Turning to HR, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers/"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> suggests in this <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-business-partners-should-become-analytics-luk-smeyers-smeyers/"" target=""_blank"">classic article</a>, that the role of the translator in people analytics should be the preserve of HR Business Partners. As people analytics continues to mature, it will be interesting to see if this is what transpires or whether organisations will create a specific role (let’s call it a People Analytics Business Partner) who works alongside the HRBP but has the deeper analytics knowledge required to build a more effective bridge with the business. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a>, Luk’s colleague at iNostix by Deloitte, published a quintet of excellent articles in 2017 and this, her first of 2018, is of a similar high standard. As highlighted in the earlier article by Evan Sinar, many organisations are still struggling to either get their people analytics programs off the ground or, for others that have, build sustainable capability. Laura provides five steps for organisations towards achieving sustainable impact including themes such as mission, priorities, operating model and team (e.g. build/borrow/buy). Laura has helped several organisations build thriving people analytics functions and the summary of her lessons learned (<strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong>) are consistent with what I have seen too.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4: </em></strong><em>5 lessons learned in helping build people analytics functions (Source: Laura Stevens)</em>  </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One lesson that I’d add to Laura Stevens’ list (Figure 4) of ingredients required to building sustainable people analytics capability is that of having <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-constitutes-best-practice-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">an inspirational leader</a>. One such person is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a>, who is Global Head of People Analytics at Pfizer. Arun shared some insights of what is involved in leading a people analytics team in two articles. In Part 2 (see also <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-people-analytics-leader-part-1-building-capability-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a>), Arun outlines the intra- and inter-responsibilities of the people analytics leader (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>), as well as sharing his experience on how to develop an analytical culture. In the second half of the article, Arun shares his thoughts on what lies ahead for the people analytics field and also provides several pearls of wisdom on the subject of ethics and privacy. Analytics in HR kindly made Arun's and my article their #1 <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/blog/trending-hr-analytics-articles-february-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Top Trending HR Analytics Article of February</a>, so thank you very much.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5: </em></strong><em>The Intra- and Inter- responsibilities of the Head of People Analytics (Source: Arun Chidambaram)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The third article this month written by a Head of People Analytics (along with Dawn and Arun). <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhartmann/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Hartmann</a> makes a compelling case that too many people analytics teams are spending time and effort on reproducing (often with inferior results) what we already know from existing research. Peter explains that this is invariably caused by ‘<em>not invented here syndrome</em>’, where stakeholders may too often dismiss the notion that proven external research applies to their company. As Peter then goes on to suggest, citing a sublime article by Thomas Rasmussen and Dave Ulrich (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090261615000443"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Learning from practice: how HR analytics avoids being a management fad</a>), a balance should be struck between combining external research with company specific variables as this will not only aid the speed of the work, but also the quality and validity of the insights.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This illuminating report by Bain outlines how demographics, automation and inequality have the potential to dramatically reshape our world in the 2020s and beyond. As <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> shows, the headline finding is that the collision of these three forces could trigger economic disruption far greater than we have experienced over the past 60 years. The more advanced People Analytics teams are already helping their organisations prepare a path through this minefield, in terms of helping with restructuring, workforce mix and organisational design. The report examines six core areas: i) the impact of aging populations and the end of plentiful labour, ii) how automation on the one hand will increase productivity but on the other eliminate jobs and suppress wages, iii) how rising inequality could affect growth, iv) how development will unfold in the ‘turbulent’ 2020s, v) considers the outlook if governments intervene more actively in the marketplace to address economic imbalances, and; vi) focuses on the practical business implications of these trends for leadership teams. It’s a long, but worthwhile read. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6: </em></strong><em>The collision of demographics, automation and inequality is likely to create decades of disruption (Source: Bain Macro Trends Group Analysis) </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This peak into the future describes how emotion-sensing technologies (EST) can potentially help employees make better decisions, improve concentration, and adopt healthier and more productive work styles. Examples of technologies that will help identify boredom, heightened stress levels and burnout are provided. Naturally, one of the big barriers to implementation (see <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong>) are concerns related to privacy. The article describes the need for education and transparency, as well as clear governance but also interestingly recommends that employees should have sole control and ownership of their data. This debate on who ‘owns’ employee data is one I expect to grow in the coming years as EST become more commonplace.  </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7: </em></strong><em>Implementation Barriers for Emotion-Sensing Technologies - Multiple measures are available to appraise stress, attention, and decision-making. Each presents different cost-, complexity-, and privacy-related barriers (Source: MIT Sloan Management Review)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>February was another terrific month for podcasts and my planes, trains and automobile journeys have been more fulfilling for being able to consume these gems.

David R. Green,"February 25, 2018",The role of the People Analytics leader - Part 2: Creating organisational culture & shaping the future,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-people-analytics-leader-part-2-creating-culture-david-green/,"[<p>The Head of People Analytics is absolutely pivotal in determining whether an organisation is able to successfully implement people analytics and create a sustainable long-term culture of data driven HR.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a> has helped four Fortune 500 companies build sustainable capability in people analytics, and is widely recognised amongst peers as one of leading proponents and visionaries in the field.</p>, <p><em>Arun Chidambaram speaking at People Analytics World in London in April 2017 - </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/key-takeways-from-people-analytics-world-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><em>see here</em></a><em> (Pic: Andreas Grieger / Tucana)</em></p>, <p>In <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-people-analytics-leader-part-1-building-capability-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a> (<em>Questions 1-8</em>) of this series, Arun shared his experience on the skills and capabilities you need in a people analytics team, how these evolve over time and the options in how to align the team to the business. Arun also outlined his five-step methodology for undertaking people analytics projects, which many people have since commented how helpful they found it.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In Part 2, Arun and I cover the following areas:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>David, you are right to say that people analytics is a very challenging and dynamic field due to the surge in interest and demand. I split my role into intra- and inter- team responsibilities (as illustrated in <strong><em>Figure 5 </em></strong>below). It is critical for the leader to know each element of this climate well to support their team and also provide a sustainable and high-value service to the business.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: The Inter- and Intra-Company responsibilities of the People Analytics Leader (Source: Arun Chidambaram)</em></p>, <p>People analytics is a combination of Process, Technology, and Skills (see <strong><em>Q10</em></strong> and <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong>) and attaining the right balance between the three is paramount in providing sustainable capability in the long-term.</p>, <p>It should be remembered that the analytics role varies between companies. For example, some companies group reporting and analytics together, whilst others make them distinct and separate. If we limit the focus to analytics, I believe the team will be engaged in nine broad distinct categories of work (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below). As a leader, you have to design business plans, create forecasts and make investment decisions as highlighted on the intra- side (of <strong><em>Figure 5)</em></strong>.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6 – </em></strong><em>Nine broad categories of work undertaken by a People Analytics team (Source: Arun Chidambaram)</em></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7 – </em></strong><em>Three elements to get right in People Analytics (Source: Arun Chidambaram)</em></p>, <p>For me this is the toughest of the three. You have to get senior leadership buy-in, you need to make sure you are fully aligned to the business plan, understand your organisational maturity for analytics, report to the right person, and develop strong partnerships with others on the intra- side.</p>, <p>I strongly advocate spending time both in and outside the business when it comes to technology. Work with your internal IT group that supports your enterprise analytics teams. This is where you can partner with data scientists with advanced visualisation and statistical backgrounds. They are great resources as are the other business analytics teams in your company. Partner with them to understand how they are working with new technologies. On the vendor side, engage and look to be part of their community, speak to your peers and identify partner(s) that can help you with the business priorities most important to your organisation. Create an environment of pilots and try new things with these vendors. Be careful not to get overwhelmed. You have to accept that you can’t buy every piece of cool technology you see! </p>, <p>People analytics is fundamentally interdisciplinary in nature. You need I/O psychologists that can understand employee behaviours, economists and statisticians that can analyse the data and experienced HR practitioners who can help guide you with the cultural transformation. Hiring the right team is one of the most important steps in being successful and it’s important not to compromise when it comes to these skills. But equally as important is making sure you hire the right skills at the right time. If you hire a statistician before you are ready for advanced data science, you’re going to end up with one unhappy camper. As a leader you are responsible for setting the right path for the team and ensuring that each member is aware of areas such as:</p>, <p>The leader has to balance the eagerness from the analytics team to do advanced work with the maturity level and readiness of the business and HR. It can be a delicate process and a critical one as if either is out of sync then the analytical journey can be in jeopardy.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I have found that these five attributes have helped my own success, the teams I lead and the HR/business leaders I serve:</p>, <p>Change management is hard in any field and people analytics is no different. There are a lot of moving parts in establishing a successful people analytics function. Timing is everything but as we have already discussed you have to think calmly in introducing new concepts linked to organisational maturity. The common understanding of analytics across HR colleagues is very diverse and you have to furnish the analytical support accordingly. In addition, there is fair amount time the leader spends on non-analytical processes so having patience is a key trait to being successful.</p>, <p>The people analytics leader has to have a diverse thought mindset given that they work with people from a variety of backgrounds. For example, business and HR leaders talk less about the data and require the relevance to the business whilst your direct team wants to get into a technical discussion about data and analytics. The people analytics leader also works with a diverse set of people from finance, IT, security, legal, privacy, academia, and external think tanks. Each tends to come with differing viewpoints and objectives so the ability to think holistically is a very critical skillset that an analytics leader should master.</p>, <p>The people analytics leader is typically leading a relatively new and evolving initiative within HR so consequently needs to lead from the front and steer most conversations and projects. The leader cannot just restrict their time to the technical aspects of the work but also needs to lead on the non-technical aspects too. For example if you are introducing Organisational Network Analysis, say as a pilot, it’s the role of the leader to identify and manage the project, find sponsorship, design the process, make a decision on make-buy-rent, work closely with legal and privacy, educate procurement etc. The leader has to easily switch between tactical and strategic thinking and get used to working with ambiguity and complexity.</p>, <p>The people analytics leader manages a group of people who are very smart and in high demand. Data science is one of the hottest areas of business and there is an extreme supply shortage of this talent in HR. This means that leading the team can be challenging. As a leader you need to be very clear in setting and managing expectations as well as being open and attentive to the needs of the team. You will have to keep the team engaged, shield them from non-analytical requests, devote time to their development, educate them with regards to data privacy, help them understand how HR works and also the business culture within your company regarding decision-making. As a leader, you also have to create an ecosystem for the team to spend time on research and data. Be careful not to turn their work into an endless repetitive schedule of report generation and instead keep the creativity in them alive.</p>, <p>The people analytics leader has to connect with other analytics cohorts within the business and across the industry. The advantages of doing this include achieving economies of scale on analytical tools by utilising them across the company. Other benefits include knowledge sharing, resource sharing, and identifying career paths for your team (and other talent in the business). </p>, <p><em>Arun Chidambaram speaking at People Analytics &amp; Future of Work in Philadelphia in September 2017 on five attributes that have helped his success as a people analytics leader - see more </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-people-analytics-its-impact-hr-future-work-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The first thing to remember is that it’s not an ‘us’ and ‘them’ but a ‘we’. We need to first understand the role of the HRBP, HR leader or business stakeholder if we expect them to understand our work. I recommend a process whereby one of the analytics team is involved at the beginning of the project and then stays with the HRBP and business stakeholder right through implementation. By doing this you build mutual trust and become more effective in areas such as:</p>, <p>In terms of embedding an analytical mindset, by all means develop a training program for HRBPs and the wider HR team to enthuse them and make them more comfortable with data. Give them access to some of the tools. For example, I have found that providing the HR community with access to Tableau or a similar tool helps them feel part of our work. Above all, have a learning mindset when working with HRBPs and the HR community; listen more and talk less. Trust me, you will reap the benefit in return.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Creating a process to properly define and prioritise projects is a critical step in the evolution of the people analytics team to:</p>, <p>Some of the steps I have taken in the past to support this are:</p>, <p>Creating a business plan and aligning to the HR operating plan early in the planning cycle so that you are very clear on strategic business demands. This reinforces the partnership with divisional HRBPs, supports planning and ensures that the right expectations are set with all stakeholders at the outset.</p>, <p>Creating a climate where you can say ‘No’ to requests that don’t fall under the responsibilities of the team e.g. if reporting is not part of your team then be careful to say no to requests in this area. Otherwise you can expect to be inundated with a flood of requests that will distract you from the work you should be doing. Just because you have the information does not mean you should provide it.</p>, <p>Developing a common dashboard that provides business/HR stakeholders with access to multiple metrics at the click of the button. On top of stemming the flood of requests you’d otherwise receive, it helps with the education of differentiating the provision of descriptive data to the business with analytics.</p>, <p>Regularly sharing and communicating our work – including the process of our ecosystem: how we work, how we run models etc. I find that the more business/HR stakeholders learn about what a people analytics team does then the number of inappropriate requests you get falls.</p>, <p>Connecting stakeholders in the business with similar requests so that the project is undertaken once instead of multiple times. Using programs like R, you can run a generalised code to parse out insights for different groups on an as needed basis and essentially productise the request. An example of this is the analysis we produce regarding attrition.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I recommend spending a reasonable amount of time experimenting with new methods and techniques in a lab setting. Part of the collective role of the analytics team should be to identify and connect with new vendors, peer groups and attend key conferences and seminars as well as partner with internal business teams in analytics.</p>, <p>An important point to keep in mind is the need to loop in key HRBPs and HR leadership teams to keep them up to date with progress in the people analytics space through demos and other knowledge sharing techniques. A good example is with Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) where we started to first learn the science behind it and, in parallel, identify a suitable pilot project to leverage this science across the company. We worked with multiple vendors, academia, and thought leaders, and took it back to our lab to better understand the make-buy-rent options.</p>, <p>Try not to get overwhelmed with the hype in the marketplace. Focus on the business problems you are trying to solve and be mindful about your company culture. For example, if your organisation is not ready for projects that include the collection and analysis of wearable data from employees, then don’t do it. Spend time experimenting with new data sources and technologies and wait for the right time. Test before jumping to a solution and be patient.</p>, <p><strong><em>Arun is one of the leading innovators in the practitioner space when it comes to ONA.

David R. Green,"February 14, 2018","Analytics of the people, by the people, for the people",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analytics-people-david-green/,"[<p>Yes, it’s a slightly grandiose title: it might make a few people smile; it’ll probably make many more sigh. Some may even consider it Lincolnesque(!), but the <a href=""http://pafow.com/w128/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work</a> (PAFOW) conference that took place on 1-2 February in San Francisco definitely deserves such a lavish title.</p>, <p>In my three years first attending and now co-chairing PAFOW, the conference has always stood out from the crowd as being the richest for content, shared learning and participative collaboration amongst delegates. That is down to the environment of trust and curiosity that has been created by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> and the PAFOW team. The latest edition of PAFOW was the best yet, and every delegate I spoke to during and after the event concurred with that sentiment.</p>, <p>As ever, Al created a panel of speakers that represented a veritable who’s who of the people analytics space and an agenda that ably demonstrated how the field is both broadening and deepening its reach. Whereas in prior years, the focus of people analytics has very much been on creating business value, PAFOW confirmed that the emphasis is now almost as equally on creating value for the employee (hence the ostentatious title of this article!).</p>, <p>It is an exciting time to work in the people analytics space. Interest levels have never been so high, and with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> revealing in his speech that 69% of large organisations now have a people analytics team, growth may finally be set to become exponential. As the perfect storm of technology, rising employee expectations and digitisation converge, so the opportunities (and challenges) facing people analytics teams become more substantial.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> represents my synopsis of the main opportunities and challenges that were discussed at PAFOW. This is not an exclusive list as many other opportunities and challenges exist in our space, but it does represent a healthy proportion and provides a basis for summarising the key themes that emerged at PAFOW.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1: </em></strong><em>The opportunities and challenges for people analytics (Source: David Green, 2018)</em></p>, <p>Let’s look at each side of the model, starting with the opportunities:</p>, <p>A big takeaway from PAFOW was the scale of ambition many speakers voiced on the magnitude of impact people analytics can or will have on business. Josh Bersin described how people analytics is increasingly being viewed by CEOs as offering their organisations competitive advantage. Similarly, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a>’s opening keynote set the scene perfectly as he advocated for people analytics moving beyond the traditional uses of methodologies such as employee listening and workforce planning to truly strategic aims that drive business transformation (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>). <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-whiteman-ph-d-02a8097/"" target=""_blank"">Heather Whiteman</a> followed RJ to the podium, and provided a compelling case study of how analytics informed the talent strategy that took GE Digital from 200 to 26,000 employees over a five-year period. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a>’s account of how Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) has helped change business practice and drive innovation at GM was especially compelling. The 4D model he outlined: Discovery, Development, Diffusion and Disruption and the consequent identification of energisers, brokers and connectors in the GM network has helped create disruptive products like Maven and Book by Cadiliac. It is one of the best examples I’ve seen of the huge potential business benefit offered by ONA. This excellent MIT SMR article ‘<a href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-catalyze-innovation-in-your-organization/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">How to catalyse innovation in your organisation</a>’ provides a detailed account of the GM case study, as will Michael’s forthcoming book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Adaptive-Space-Disrupting-Transforming-Organizations/dp/1260118029"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Adaptive Space</a>.   </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2: </em></strong><em>Opportunities for business transformation with people analytics (Source: RJ Milnor)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Josh Bersin presented his new organisation model (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>) and highlighted that the extent of this shift is driving rapid change in HR technology and widening the focus of people analytics teams. The future of work is here with the majority of organisations almost in a perpetual state of transformation and continually having to reinvent themselves. With the workforce becoming more liquid, the challenge for people analytics teams is to extend its traditional focus on full-time and prospective employees to the wider ecosystem of work. This ‘opportunity’ was a significant part of RJ Milnor’s presentation. Coupled with Strategic Workforce Analytics, RJ described how people analytics can help organisations assess the feasibility of business strategy through scenario planning and probability analysis. Being involved at the heart of business strategy in this way will certainly elevate the impact of people analytics and potentially lead to the function becoming more closely aligned with Corporate Strategy than HR. This is an area I will come back to later in this article. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3: </em></strong><em>Moving to the new organisation model (Sources: Josh Bersin, Bersin by Deloitte - read more in </em><a href=""http://blog.bersin.com/prediction-1-agile-organization-models-will-start-to-go-mainstream/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>this article</em></a><em>)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The aforementioned (and very much welcome) shift in emphasis of people analytics teams to create value for the employee (as well as the business) was much in evidence at PAFOW. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-nagy-6b5a73b/"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Nagy</a>’s presentation explained the importance of employee centred design to analytics, which in this case related to the creation of an employee listening program at USAA. There was much to admire about the approach Charlotte outlined, not least how employee experience has been elevated to the same level as member experience, how the program evolved through pilots and test and learn methodology, how trust is prioritised and through the value provided to leaders, managers and employees. After two years, 70% of USAA’s employees have opted in, which is testament to the employee centred approach that lies at the heart of the program. Ultimately, I believe that the focus and desire of people analytics teams to design and enhance the employee experience will drive the growth of the discipline, increase employee trust and buy-in and lead to the development of data-driven cultures.   </p>, <p><em>PAFOW Speakers (From L to R): Al Adamsen, Geetanjali Gamel (Merck) and Michael Arena (GM)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In his opening address, Al Adamsen presented his <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-30-al-adamsen/"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics 3.0 model</a>, which describes how people analytics teams are increasingly taking on the challenge of developing analytically based products for their organisations. These products cover tools to drive career development, employee listening, team productivity, wellbeing and workforce planning. This was the centrepiece of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremywelland/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Welland</a>’s terrific presentation on the work of his team at PayPal, which he has given the moniker ‘Portraits of Innovation’ (see <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong>). The five examples provided are nicely split between providing benefit to employees (e.g. insights to navigate their careers) and the business (e.g. retaining key talent and driving improved productivity). <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianpaolobarozzi/"" target=""_blank"">Gianpaolo Barozzi</a> demonstrated an ONA-type tool that has been created by Cisco to improve team productivity and collaboration as well as helping employees with insights to develop their networks. Expect to see more people analytics teams broadening the scope of their work to product development in the coming years.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong><em>: Portraits of Innovation from PayPal's People Analytics team (Source: Jeremy Welland)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Reporting may be a necessity but it can also prove to be a curse for people analytics team and ultimately stymie their progress. Whilst some speakers (e.g. Jeremy Welland at PayPal and Geetanjali Gamel at Merck) described how responsibility for reporting and analytics had been split into separate teams in their companies, many more face the challenge of managing both. Given that many in the wider HR function are still ignorant of the difference between reporting and analytics this invariably manifests itself in endless requests for reports and consequently less time to focus on analytics. How do you solve for this? The collective advice of speakers was through a combination of self-service, education and ruthless prioritisation. The presentation by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgainsboro/"" target=""_blank"">David Gainsboro</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottwalker521/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Walker</a> on how they drove self-service at Dropbox was particularly convincing (see key learnings in <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below). This involved creating a data warehouse that consolidated data from 15 systems across the talent lifecycle. Tableau was then used to visualise four key focus areas for executives with additional dashboards created as the user group expanded. A curriculum for user enablement was also implemented, which ultimately has helped empower end users, created a data driven culture and freed up the analytics team to focus on other projects. A win-win all round.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: Key takeaways from David Gainsboro's and Scott Walker's presentation on how self-service and education empowered users with people data at Dropbox (Source: David Gainsboro and Scott Walker)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The recent landmark High-Impact People Analytics Study led by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a> for Bersin by Deloitte found that organisations can only reach their full potential in people analytics when data-driven decision making is embedded in their company culture. Many of the speakers at PAFOW outlined how their organisations had tackled this substantial challenge, which in addition to the Dropbox example already provided included:</p>, <p>Each of the above examples and others outlined by speakers at PAFOW shared a number of common characteristics:</p>, <p><em>PAFOW Speakers (L to R): Jeremy Welland (PayPal), Charlotte Nagy (USAA) and Jonathan Ferrar (Insight222)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst developing an analytical culture is a prerequisite, this is a element most organisations acknowledge is necessary to drive sustainable success in people analytics. However, the need to also focus on the development of the people analytics team itself is often overlooked. Given the pace of evolution of the discipline and the high-demand for talent in the space, this is an egregious error. It was refreshing therefore that the main focus of Geetanjali Gamel’s presentation was on this very topic. Geetanjali described the program she has initiated at Merck that combines: Capability, Capacity and Connectivity (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong>) to help development in skills, scope of work, relationships and ultimately career opportunities. Look out for more on this in a future article between Geetanjali and me.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong>: <em>Developing the people analytics team at Merck through capability, capacity and communication (Source: Geetanjali Gamel)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>During his speech, Josh Bersin pondered whether the fact that the vast majority of people analytics teams still being based under the auspices of HR, was a sign of the discipline’s immaturity. Certainly, many organisations have developed business analytics teams that encompass most company functions – minus HR. Moreover, one of the major obstacles impacting people analytics teams is the capability of the wider HR function when it comes to analytics. It will be interesting to see how the ‘alignment’ aspect develops over the coming years. Team structure was an area touched upon by a number of speakers, with many advocating that this needs to evolve in line with organisational maturity – similar to how <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a> describes <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-people-analytics-leader-part-1-building-capability-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Of all the suggestions proffered at PAFOW in this area, I found the one suggested here in <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong> by RJ Milnor, which places people analytics at the centre of the enterprise (right) rather than two levels down from the business (left) the most compelling. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong><em>: To deliver on its full promise, people analytics teams should look to align themselves with the enterprise (Source: RJ Milnor)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Ethics is arguably the most important facet of people analytics and based on research conducted by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> presented at PAFOW, it also represents the biggest challenge facing the discipline. The study found that 81% of people analytics projects are jeopardised by ethics and privacy concerns. With the increased focus on the employee and emerging data sources such as wearables, email and social media this challenge is only likely to get bigger. Jonathan outlined a number of recommendations such as the need to develop a code of practice, create a governance council and to work closely with the Chief Privacy Officer. He also urged that organisations should be open and transparent with employees, and be clear on what the data will be used for and how it will benefit the employee. Jonathan then outlined a number of case studies including one at IBM, where the creation of an employee listening program - Social Pulse - has had the dual benefit of helping the company develop a detailed understanding of employee sentiment, and for employees several examples where IBM acted on these insights to improve employee experience. For a more detailed Case Study on Social Pulse, please refer to the interview with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadatshami/"" target=""_blank"">Sadat Shami</a> on page 12 of the white paper ‘<a href=""http://ibm.biz/EthicalHRAnalytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Grey Area: Ethical Dilemmas in HR Analytics</a>’, which <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> and me published in February 2018. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-deneau-36b9201/"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Deneau</a> closed PAFOW with a powerful example of ethics in practice and how analytics had underpinned the diversity and inclusion strategy at Intuit. The debate of privacy vs. trust is set to be a defining one in the years ahead and it is important that people analytics leaders and practitioners get this right. If we get it wrong, we will set the discipline back – perhaps irretrievably. </p>, <p><em>PAFOW Speakers (L to R) - RJ Milnor (McKesson), Scott Walker &amp; David Gainsboro (Dropbox) and Heather Whiteman (GE Digital) </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The pace of change digital has foisted upon business has arguably never been so fast, but frighteningly will probably never be this slow again. To survive, organisations need to be continually reinventing themselves, developing new products and services and adjusting the talent mix accordingly. This is placing a heavy burden on HR leaders, who are in turn becoming increasingly reliant on people analytics leaders and teams. Whilst this is an undoubted challenge for our space, it also presents numerous opportunities for us to elevate the people analytics profession and make it an indispensible part of business and a core component of the future HR function. The evidence from the speakers, vendors and delegates at PAFOW is that they are all up for this challenge. A sign that business and investors are beginning to take human capital more seriously emerged in the panel debate with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauriebassi/"" target=""_blank"">Laurie Bassi</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-higgins-5875082/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Higgins</a>, which revealed moves to develop an ISO standard for human capital reporting. This development is one worth keeping an eye on.  </p>, <p><em>PAFOW Speakers: (From L to R) - Michelle Deneau (Intuit), Gianpaolo Barozzi (Cisco) and Nicky Clement (Unilever)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Andy Warhol once predicted “<em>in the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes</em>”. When it comes to the vendors at PAFOW this drops to five minutes as each gets their moment in the sun to pitch the business problem they are trying to solve. The didn't disappoint. Much of the innovation in the space is being driven by the vendor community, and those present at PAFOW represented some of the leading lights in the following areas:</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 8: </em></strong><em>The people analytics vendors that participated in the vendor showcase at PAFOW 2018 in San Francisco</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>That has to go to Nicky Clement, who during the part of her speech that focused on the evolution of employee listening at Unilever commented “I don’t believe in survey fatigue. I believe in survey inaction fatigue”. This is an especially shrewd comment as it’s all very well for organisations to listen to their employees, but if they don’t analyse and more importantly act on what they are saying, then really what is the point?</p>, <p>As well as checking out the PAFOW site regularly for the latest news and <a href=""https://globalpeopleanalytics.site-ym.com/?page=joinnow"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">joining the Global People Analytics Network</a>, I can highly recommend reading <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/teuschb/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Teusch</a>’s and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arun-sundar-2290237/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Sundar</a>’s excellent reflections on PAFOW – see links below.</p>, <p>Al and the PAFOW team are organising a series of events for 2018, which I definitely recommend attending.

Green,"February 6, 2018",Top 10 HR & People Analytics articles of January 2018,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-10-hr-people-analytics-articles-january-2018-david-green/,"[<p>2018 has certainly started with a bang. I had the pleasure of being co-chair of the best <a href=""http://pafow.com/w128/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work</a> (PAFOW) conference yet last week in San Francisco (write-up to follow next week).</p>, <p>As my co-chair <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> so presciently outlined in his opening to the conference, people analytics has evolved into its <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-30-al-adamsen/"" target=""_blank"">third iteration</a>, whereby value is increasingly being delivered to employees. Subsequent speeches from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremywelland/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Welland</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>, Josh Bersin, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-nagy-6b5a73b/"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Nagy</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianpaolobarozzi/"" target=""_blank"">Gianpaolo Barozzi</a> reinforced this sentiment.</p>, <p>This demonstrates that people analytics is moving in the right direction and with <a href=""https://www.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin by Deloitte</a>’s recent High-Impact People Analytics study finding that 69 per cent of large organisations now have a people analytics team, the growth of the discipline shows no signs of abating.</p>, <p>As the use of people analytics broadens and deepens within organisations so does the amount of literature published on the field. This means that my previous strategy of collecting and curating the best articles on a bi-monthly basis is no longer enough. Henceforth, this series will appear on a monthly basis and not only gather the best articles, but the best podcasts on people analytics too.</p>, <p>So without further ado, here are my favourite 10 articles and 3 podcasts from January on people analytics and its role in both the future of work and the evolution of the HR function:</p>, <p>One of the reasons that interest in and adoption of people analytics is rising is its integral role in digital HR strategy. Indeed, as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> outlines in this excellent piece, analytics is one of the three key priorities of a digital HR strategy: i) actively manage the customer expectation of the function, ii) develop the organisation from jobs to skills based, and iii) provide people analytics insights. As Volker correctly asserts, digital HR is not simply about digitising what HR has done in the past, but is an opportunity to do things differently (and better). Volker’s model (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) illustrates perfectly the enhancements that are needed to innovate and shift the culture of HR. Data and analytics is fundamental to this shift. This is a must-read for any HR or business leader about to or thinking of embarking on a digital HR strategy.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 1</em></strong><em>: Establishing an innovation culture in HR (Source: Volker Jacobs | TI People)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Writing in Raconteur, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> provides compelling evidence on the reasons behind the growth in people analytics. The perfect storm he describes comprises i) increases in the volume and variety of data, ii) the heightened level of insights this provides, iii) the boost in power and scale thanks to the entry of AI into the domain, and iv) a shift in focus from HR to business as companies seek to use analytics to solve operational, risk, sales and performance challenges. As ever with Josh, it is an insightful and illuminating read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The Head of People Analytics is a pivotal role and having the right person leading the team can make the difference between success and failure when it comes to creating and sustaining a data driven culture in HR. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a>, who leads people analytics at Pfizer, is a leader who possesses all of the ingredients required to succeed in this demanding role. In part 1 of our interview series, Arun covers areas such as team capabilities and structure, alignment to the business and how this evolves over time, his tried and tested project methodology (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below) and insights into key learnings. The advice offered is invaluable and I am grateful to Arun for sharing this with the community. Part 2 will be published w/c 19 February.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 2</em></strong> - <em>Five-Step Research Methodology for People Analytics (Source: Arun Chidambaram)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>People analytics projects have a habit of busting myths and that certainly applies in this HBR article, which details the findings of a case study from the people analytics team at Facebook. The myth that people don’t quit jobs, they quit managers was exposed – at least at Facebook – as not being the case. Indeed, the team found that the opposite was true with people leaving when their job wasn’t enjoyable, their strengths weren’t being used, and they weren’t growing in their careers. The study highlighted the importance of work design and this is where managers have an important role to play in crafting meaningful and motivating roles that employees enjoy. Examples of how this was achieved are then outlined. Facebook has invested significantly in its people analytics capability. If you are interested in working with the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottjuddpublic/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Judd</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-sparkman-msc-mba-mhr-12710b14/"" target=""_blank"">Ross Sparkman</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardrosenow/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Rosenow</a> – click <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6362363308510711808/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The key headline in this excellent McKinsey study on diversity in the workplace is the strong correlation between diversity and company financial performance. The study found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity were 21% more likely to experience above-average profitability than companies in the bottom quartile. For ethnic and cultural diversity, the likelihood of outperformance was even higher at 33% more likely between top and bottom quartile. The article (and <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Organization/Our%20Insights/Delivering%20through%20diversity/Delivering-through-Diversity-web-final.ashx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">accompanying report</a>) are a treasure trove of information, and the advice offered (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>) on creating impact through diversity, which includes the use of analytics, is invaluable for HR and business leaders alike. Diversity is a strong area of interest for people analytics teams, and this superb report is an excellent font of knowledge to support this work. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 3</em></strong><em>: </em>Four imperatives for building a successful inclusion and diversity (I&amp;D) strategy<em> (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the most welcome initiatives I read in January comes from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/littal-shemer-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Littal Shemar Haim</a>, who has set herself the challenge of highlighting 365 women worth watching in the HR Tech / People Analytics space. Littal is adding to the suspense by adding one name per day over 2018 and has already included the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a/"" target=""_blank"">Esther Bongenaar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicky-clement/"" target=""_blank"">Nicky Clement</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin/"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetanjali-gamel-17209b68/"" target=""_blank"">Geetanjali Gamel</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-deneau-36b9201/"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Deneau</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/slupushor/"" target=""_blank"">Stela Lupushor</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/majabrykczynska/"" target=""_blank"">Maja Luckos</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mari%C3%ABllesonnenberg/"" target=""_blank"">Mariëlle Sonnenberg</a>. I’m really interested to watch this unfurl and have no doubt that Littal will achieve her aim as there is a serious amount of female talent in our discipline. One to bookmark and come back to on a weekly basis. In a similar vein, the tireless <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hunglee/"" target=""_blank"">Hung Lee</a> has created a list of female conference speakers (see <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VrPfFDZfzMs97Y5NXqphXvRAAkY7vkmn7IPowfcNw_0/edit#gid=0"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) having being inspired by being part of an all-male speaking line-up at a recent conference.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Bersin by Deloitte ran a great series in January comprising 12 blogs outlining their predictions for 2018. All 12 are worth a read – particularly those by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinericksonphd/"" target=""_blank"">Robin Erickson</a> (see <a href=""http://blog.bersin.com/prediction-11-talent-acquisition-will-tap-the-power-of-internal-mobility/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and Josh Bersin (<a href=""http://blog.bersin.com/prediction-1-agile-organization-models-will-start-to-go-mainstream/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://blog.bersin.com/prediction-2-accelerating-digital-transformation-will-force-new-leadership-models/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), but the one that really resonated with me was this one by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>. The article provides more insights from Bersin’s recently published High-Impact People Analytics Study and case studies from the likes of Chevron, Reliance Jio and Merck. As Madhura states, companies need to be careful not to isolate their people analytics team as this will greatly lessen their impact. Instead, companies need to put their teams centre stage to realise the true promise of people analytics – that is its ability to bolster employee engagement and productivity at a day-to-day level—and in doing so, to deliver business results.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> touches on one of the main themes of the aforementioned PAFOW conference I co-chaired in San Francisco last week with Al Adamsen – that people analytics needs to diversify beyond making better HR decisions and solving business issues. Morten’s article outlines a third avenue for people analytics – working in tandem with change management. As Morten describes people analytics can be used in numerous areas such as to identify likely resistance and change agents, analyse employee sentiment and create predictive adoption models.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Of all HR functions, it is perhaps talent acquisition that has most embraced the use of data and analytics. This is borne out in LinkedIn’s excellent Global Recruiting Trends 2018 report. Indeed, along with Diversity, New Interviewing Tools and AI, Data is cited as one of the four trends revolutionising recruiting. Interestingly, the research found that 50% respondents believe that data is very/extremely important, but that only 18% had mostly/completely adopted it within their hiring strategy. The research itself is a highly recommended read and features contributions from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> (Microsoft), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/devinrogozinski/"" target=""_blank"">Devin Rogozinski</a> (Atlassian), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/schveninger/"" target=""_blank"">Catalina Schveninger</a> (Vodafone), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrislouie/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Louis</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougshagam/"" target=""_blank"">Doug Shagam</a> (Nielsen), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/realworkrealimpact/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Mailey</a> (Intuit) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annaott/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Ott</a>. The second article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariaignatova/"" target=""_blank"">Maria Ignatova</a> and Kate Reilly summarises the key findings, whilst the third offers the perspective of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanbrowne/"" target=""_blank"">Brendan Browne</a>, who leads recruiting globally for LinkedIn (see also video below).</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 4</em></strong><em>: Top uses of data in talent acquisition (Source: LinkedIn 2018 Global Recruiting Trends)</em></p>, <p>Behavioural economics and the potential it offers to organisations is suddenly very much in vogue. In part this is due to Richard Thaler, one of the discipline’s <a href=""https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/9/16447752/richard-thaler-nobel-explained-economics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">pioneers</a>, recently winning the Nobel prize in economics. It can also be attributed to the work of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock/"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5/"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a> at Google, which is touched upon by the former in the first article. Three further articles are included. The first, by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertgraywriterandeditor/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Gray</a>, is a captivating crash-course into the power of the ‘nudge’ and the potential benefit it offers to HR. The second, by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-martin-13832b5/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Martin</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aferrere/"" target=""_blank"">Antoine Ferrere</a>, examines how you build this capability within an organisation and provides options on where this new function should sit. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-g%C3%BCntner-05176920/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Güntner</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-julia-maria-sperling-935b64118/"" target=""_blank"">Julia Sperling</a>’s article includes a case study on how Virgin Atlantic deployed behavioural economics to reduce fuel use by its 335 flight captains. With Bock’s new venture <a href=""http://www.humu.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humu</a> promising “<em>to make work better with science, machine learning and a little bit of love</em>,” we can expect to read much more about behavioural economics in 2018.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>January was a stellar month for podcasts in our discipline. The first two focus on the topic of Organisational Network Analysis, which was featured prominently at PAFOW. The discussion between <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> and Al Adamsen is fascinating and illustrates the many potential uses of ONA within companies. The conversation between <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a>, who spoke so passionately about ONA at PAFOW and who has successfully deployed ONA at GM to gain insight into innovation, is equally fascinating. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colenussbaumer/"" target=""_blank"">Cole Nussbaumer</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marktlawrence/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lawrence</a> talk about the critical skills of visualisation and storytelling in the Tucana People Analytics podcast.

I also managed to publish, co-author and/or feature in a number of articles:</p>, <p>_____________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><em>David is a globally recognised and respected influencer, speaker and writer on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

David R. Green,"January 31, 2018",People First: What are the key HR trends for 2018?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-first-what-key-hr-trends-2018-david-green/,"[<p>We’re nearly at the end of January and with the year still in its infancy optimism still abounds with regards to the likely growing impact of HR in 2018. Although as I am typing this in San Francisco in the run up to co-chairing <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work</a>, my confidence may just be a case of jet lag combined with wishful thinking. </p>, <p>So, with a cup brimming full of sanguinity here are some trends I expect to see more of in the HR space in 2018.</p>, <p>Let’s start with what is for me the most welcome and indeed key trend. Soothsayers have long been urging HR to take a leaf out of marketing’s book and it seems that the message is finally getting through. Recognition that creating bespoke and personalised experiences for employees (and candidates) is not only good for workers but the business too is becoming common currency. This represents a radical shift from the typical ‘one-size fits all’ HR programs of the past. Companies like Cisco, IBM, Unilever and Salesforce are already doing this by combining people data with machine learning to provide personalised experiences for employees in areas such as talent acquisition, onboarding, learning and internal mobility. Many more companies are using Chatbots to enrich the employee/candidate experience (as well as to streamline HR operations). Employees expect consumer like experiences at work. Technology coupled with data enables organisations to provide these experiences. Critically the more astute companies and business leaders recognise that improving experience and better understanding employee sentiment leads to better results.</p>, <p>In Bersin by Deloitte’s <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-technology-market-disruptions-10-top-trends-2018-josh-bersin/"" target=""_blank"">HR Technology Disruptions for 2018</a> report, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> writes about the shift towards systems of productivity as well as the growing desire by business leaders to understand and improve team effectiveness. Deloitte’s 2017 Global Human Capital Trends report revealed that <a href=""https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/focus/human-capital-trends/2017/organization-of-the-future.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">48% of companies are experimenting with Organisational Network Analysis</a>. This matches my own experience of speaking to people analytics leaders, where ONA is the innovation they are most interested in. As we seek to understand the power of social capital, networks and connectors within organisations, so the rise of ONA will continue.       </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: EXAMPLE OF ONA: Quantified evidence of leaderships behaviours (Source: Greg Newman)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Up until now the rise in adoption of people analytics has been steady rather than spectacular. I expect this to change in 2018 as analytics is integral to creating personalised employee experiences (prediction #1), properly harnessing ONA (prediction #2) and is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-reasons-why-people-analytics-central-future-hr-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">the centrepiece of digital HR transformation</a>. Whilst <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/news/hr-europe-ready-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR continues to struggle with people analytics</a> particularly in areas such as creating an analytical culture, I sense a breakthrough is near. I certainly expect to see evidence of this over the next two days at People Analytics &amp; The Future of Work in San Francisco.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Not only is adoption likely start to spike in 2018, but the scope of work covered by the discipline is also broadening. Up until now the bulk of people analytics projects have largely focused on driving better business outcomes and traditional employees. This ecosystem is set to expand to incorporate contractors, freelancers and automation (hand in hand with strategic workforce planning and skills analysis). Moreover, expect to see more projects concentrated on improving employee experience (see #1) and wellbeing as well as team performance (in concert with ONA – trend #2). A good illustration of how the discipline of people analytics is evolving is provided below in <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>, which you can read more on in ‘<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-30-al-adamsen/"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics 3.0</a>’ by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a>.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 2: The evolution of people analytics (Source: Al Adamsen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The general consensus thus far about the impending EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which comes into effect in May 2018, is that it will place yet further restrictions on organisations when it comes to handling people data. But is this an overly negative mindset? I think so. A more positive way of looking at GDPR is that it will force companies to put employees first when it comes to collecting, storing and analysing data. If you can’t articulate the benefits to employees of collecting and analysing their data then don’t do the project could become the mantra. So, whilst there will undoubtedly be short-term pain for HR in complying with the GDPR, the mid-long term gain could be that it moves the ethics and privacy discussion in the right direction. Is that really such a bad thing?</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Perhaps it is the renewed focus on productivity and creating employee experiences. Maybe it is the increasing weight of evidence linking employee engagement and wellness to business results (see example <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/engagement-drives-performance-evidence-from-people-thomas/"" target=""_blank"">here</a> from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a>). Whatever the answer it is refreshing to see that the subject of wellbeing and mental health is no longer taboo. In Josh Bersin’s <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-technology-market-disruptions-10-top-trends-2018-josh-bersin/"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> highlighting the HR Technology Disruptions for 2018, he describes the market for wellbeing tools as “the next big thing”. With much of the commentary around the future of work centred on humans being displaced by machines, this is uplifting to see. Expect to see more companies providing their employees with the tools, data and “nudges” to support exercise, mental health, work/life balance and consequently motivation and happiness.   </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Another example of the “people first” approach companies are increasingly adopting with regards to employees comes in the area of behavioural economics. Once again, HR is playing catch up with marketing here as companies have long sought to understand and influence consumer behaviour. Whilst examples in HR are still in short supply, I know a number of people analytics teams that are experimenting in this area. One of these is Google (watch Prasad Setty in the video below and read <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nudges-juice-cleanses-shameful-psychology-why-most-resolutions-bock/"" target=""_blank"">this article</a> by Laszlo Bock) where much of the focus of the people analytics team is on research that helps educate Googlers on how they make decisions and to help them make better ones over time. Expect to hear more about companies researching the impact of behaviour on employees, teams and organisations.  </p>, <p>For more on the trends outlined above and similar, I recommend consuming the assets below.</p>, <p>_____________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><em>David is a globally recognised and respected influencer, speaker and writer on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

During this time, Arun has helped four Fortune 500 companies build sustainable capability in people analytics.</p>, <p>Arun is deservedly recognised by his peers as one of the leading authorities and visionaries in the space. He is regularly invited to share his insights at conferences as he did last year at People Analytics World in London (see highlights <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/key-takeways-from-people-analytics-world-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and People Analytics &amp; Future of Work in Philadelphia (see pic below and highlights <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-people-analytics-its-impact-hr-future-work-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).

If we put the reporting part to one side, the analytics teams I have built and led combine members with backgrounds in data science, behavioural economics, engineering and mathematics. Reporting directly to the CHRO or one of the CHRO’s leadership team is important as it demonstrates to the business and HR that analytics an integral component of the people strategy.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Typically, most people analytics teams are initially aligned both by division and key HR interest area. In my experience, this alignment can work well at first, but as demand from the business grows you need to think differently. You need to do this in part to optimise capacity but also to ensure the team is working on projects that are important to the business. Prioritising the work can quickly become an issue and this represents a major challenge for the head of people analytics. To mitigate this, I interview and have regular dialogue with the HR leadership team to jointly identify the top 3-5 topics that are key to achieving the business and HR strategies. I then assign a member of the team as a SME on each topic to manage both traditional and innovative analytics projects.</p>, <p>Certainly, traditional work is restricted to fine-tuning existing general HR programs and leveraging analytics for more value e.g. in areas such as succession planning. In contrast, innovative work involves the use of new and emerging methodologies such as organisational network analysis (ONA) to help solve business problems. How you balance the time you spend on each type of project depends upon your organisational maturity. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below illustrates the importance of being cognisant of organisational maturity. The top line on the graph shows analytical capability growing at an exponential rate. The bottom line represents HR consumer awareness, which from my experience grows both more erratically and also at a slower pace. Knowing where you fit and the extent of the gap helps the transition and balance between traditional and innovative. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em> – Know where you fit and the extent of the gap – Organisational maturity of people analytics (Y Axis = Investment/maturity/offerings etc; X Axis – Time) - Source: Arun Chidambaram</em></p>, <p><em>Join Arun on a webinar on 13 February to discuss The Practical Applications of Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) together with Stela Lupushor and Antony Ebelle-Ebanda. CLICK ON THE IMAGE ABOVE TO REGISTER</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Good question and team structure is a subject I’m very passionate about. It goes without saying that the structure of the team will differ between companies, but I believe that the level of organisational maturity also plays a significant role in how this structure evolves over time.</p>, <p>The model I use (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>) describes my thinking in this area:</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Evolutions in the structure and business alignment of the people analytics team (Source: Arun Chidambaram)</em></p>, <p>A typical HR structure has a business partner supporting each business with specialised fields like reward and diversity falling under a COE. The most common people analytics structure I’ve witnessed aligns one team member to the HRBPs supporting a group of business units/divisions. As your organisation gains maturity, demand will far exceed supply, and this structure is at risk of falling apart.</p>, <p>A second way to structure your group, in addition to division alignment, is to understand the key HR priorities for your company and align your team to focus on these key themes like workforce planning and talent forecasting. This method helps in prioritising your work and tackles the demand tsunami to some extent. However and just like in the business unit/division alignment, this structure will not be able to sustain the heavy forces of demand as the people analytics capability gains traction.</p>, <p>Lastly, as demand grows and maturity continues to develop, I believe that the people analytics function will need to be structured into two main areas: i) Client Facing, and; ii) Subject Matter Experts (or non-client facing) (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below).</p>, <p><em>Figure 3 – Structuring and aligning people analytics teams with subject matter experts and business facing consultants (Source: Arun Chidambaram)</em></p>, <p>In this model, a client facing group within the people analytics team connect with business units and HRBPs to understand the problem, manage projects and run post-hoc analysis and interventions. Whilst this group should have basic core analytical skills, their expertise will be weighted more towards consulting, storytelling, communication, and project &amp; program management.</p>, <p>The SME (or non-client facing role) requires deep subject matter expertise across critical disciplines such as data engineering, research and data science, experimentation and design thinking, visualisation/reporting and technology. I envision each SME area being led by an individual who would be devoted to their area of expertise.</p>, <p>Today’s team structures typically exposes members to both sides (SME and Client Facing)—and the potential challenge of this model is that some analysts will find it hard to let go of the other side as they face the decision on what direction to specialise in.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Drawing on my experience, I’d condense this into five major milestones:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The methodology for each potential project starts with a dialogue between HR and business colleagues on the problem statement and follows five rigorous steps from writing a research proposal to supporting the business in post hoc analysis and participating in post-action reviews as outlined in <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> below.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4: </em></strong><em>Five-Step Research Methodology for People Analytics (Source: Arun Chidambaram)</em></p>, <p>The five steps can be summarised as:</p>, <p>The 5 Step Methodology helps the team as well as HR and business customers in reaching a mutual understanding of the business problem and solving it in an efficient and timely way.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Establishing what is essentially a new capability in the organisations where I have worked has been both rewarding and at times challenging. The key learnings include:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-people-analytics-leader-part-2-creating-culture-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Part 2</strong></a> of the interview, Arun and I cover the following areas:</p>, <p>You can connect and/or follow Arun on LinkedIn <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and also via Twitter, which Arun has just joined, <a href=""https://twitter.com/SanaksArun"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">@SanaksArun</a></p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><em>David is a globally recognised and respected influencer, speaker and writer on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

David R. Green,"January 15, 2018",Top 40 HR & People Analytics articles of 2017,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-40-hr-people-analytics-articles-2017-david-green/,"[<p>I believe 2017 was a breakthrough year for people analytics. The last 12 months has seen the discipline <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-reasons-why-people-analytics-central-future-hr-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">move from the periphery towards the centre</a> of the HR function.  </p>, <p>This doesn’t mean that people analytics has yet crossed the chasm of widespread adoption. The champagne remains on ice. Nevertheless, the acknowledgement that <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/the-what-and-the-how-of-a-digital-hr-strategy"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">people analytics is a core component of a digital HR strategy</a> is becoming more widely acknowledged.</p>, <p>Consequently interest levels in analytics continue to soar. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/75-conferences-people-analytics-data-driven-hr-attend-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">The number of conferences on the subject has tripled</a> in the last 18 months. Adoption levels are rising too - albeit at a more sedate trajectory. The penny seems to have dropped with executives too with Josh Bersin recently writing that “<em>CEOs and CHROs now understand that people analytics is a vital part of running a high performing company</em>.”</p>, <p>For the last four years I have collated and published a compendium of the ‘best’ articles of the preceding 12 months – see <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-2014-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2014</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21-best-hr-analytics-articles-2015-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2015</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/30-best-hr-analytics-articles-2016-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">2016</a>, and following are my choices for the best 40 articles of 2017.</p>, <p>With a couple of notable exceptions, all of the articles listed are freely available to read. Most of my choices featured in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidrgreen/detail/recent-activity/posts/"" target=""_blank"">my bi-monthly round-ups</a>, but my human fallibility means that I missed a few gems. I hope I have redressed that here.</p>, <p>Thank you to all the authors below. Collectively, you are helping push the discipline forward through inspiring the growing number of people interested in people analytics and data-driven HR. I’d also like to thank the likes of Dave Millner, Caroline Brant, Richard Rosenow, Carla Gentry, Hung Lee, Nick Holley, Manoj Kumar, Andrée Laforge, Arun Chidambaram, Michael Carty, Amit Mohindra, Priya Bagga, Geetanjali Gamel and numerous others for regularly sharing and promoting my articles. Your support means a lot.</p>, <p>Without further ado and in no particular order, here are my 40 choices for 2017: </p>, <p>If you already work or are interested in the people analytics field, you must read this book. If you are a HR leader wishing to increase the impact of your function, you must read this book. If you are a business leader who expects more from HR, you must read this book. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> have written what has quickly become regarded as the definitive book to date on people analytics. The Power of People is in part informed through interviews the authors conducted with a veritable who’s who of the people analytics field encompassing practitioners, academics, analysts, HR and business executives and consultants. The results speak for themselves. To find out more check out Jonathan’s <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/detail/recent-activity/posts/"" target=""_blank"">preview articles</a> and then go and buy the book. As a taster, the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/power-people-article-3-7-jonathan-ferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Eight-Step Model for Purposeful Analytics</a> is provided as <em>Figure 1</em> below.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: The Eight-Step Model for Purposeful Analytics (Source: The Power of People: Nigel Guenole, Jonathan Ferrar and Sheri Feinzig (Pearson FT Press, 2017) </em></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> is widely acknowledged as the world’s premier analyst on HR and he has been researching and writing about people analytics for longer than most. It is perhaps significant therefore that in this article, summarising some of the key findings of Bersin’s High-Impact People Analytics Study, Josh shares his belief that “people analytics has grown up” and is now an established function in the business. Now on to the report itself: if you are even remotely interested in people analytics and you are not a Bersin member, you simply must beg, steal or borrow a copy of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>’s fabulous report. Its 71 pages are packed full of insights, case studies and advice to improve the impact of your people analytics function. Highlights include the seven top findings for driving high-impact people analytics (see <em>Figure 2</em>) and also a dramatic update and overhaul of Bersin’s infamous people analytics maturity model (see <em>Figure 3</em>). </p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Top findings from High-Impact people analytics research (Source: Bersin by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p><em>Figure 3: People Analytics Maturity Model (Source: Bersin by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> is one of the pioneers in the people analytics space having set up the Employee Insights function at Gap all the way back in 2004. He has worked tirelessly to raise the level of the discipline ever since so is well placed to describe how people analytics has evolved. As <em>Figure 4</em> and <em>Figure 5</em> below depict, and as Al describes, people analytics is moving into its third cycle where value is increasingly being delivered to those that create the data in the first place – employees. I like that Al is at pains to stress that the evolution he outlines is not a progression or maturity model – leading people analytics teams are deploying all three cycles via an ecosystem of data, tools, people, and partners. For more on Al’s thinking around 3.0, have a listen to my discussion with Al on the PAFOW podcast. Alternatively, there are still a few tickets to come and see Al speak at the <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work conference</a> he convenes in San Francisco. This year’s conference takes place on 1-2 February.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The evolution of people analytics (Source: Al Adamsen)</em></p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Embrace the “And”: People Analytics 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 within the Analytics Maturity Progression (Source: Al Adamsen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the most fascinating uses (and fastest growing areas) of people analytics is how it is being used in combination with Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) to uncover insights in areas such as team effectiveness, collaboration and organisational design. A captivating example is provided in the MIT Sloan Management Review, which provides details of a ten-year study led by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> (aka Mr ONA) combining academic research and business to answer the question: “<em>How do we best connect employees in ways that more systematically unleash emergent innovation?</em>” The findings are illuminating and in brief include highlighting the importance of Adaptive Space (see <em>Figure 6</em>). Other highlights include a compelling case study of the work <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> has led at GM, as well as a description of the three key roles within a network (Brokers, Central Connectors and Energisers). A terrific read with plenty to learn and be inspired by. More articles on ONA follow later.</p>, <p><em>Figure 6: Adaptive Space -</em> <em>the network and organisational context that allows people, ideas, information, and resources to flow across the organisation and spur successful emergent innovation</em> - <em>Source: MIT Sloan Management Review</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In many respects the practice of people analytics is going in the right direction – interest levels have soared, adoption is rising and significant sums are being invested in the space by large consultancies, tech giants and start-ups alike. However, as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marktlawrence/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lawrence</a> so passionately argue, continued growth of people analytics is under threat. They cite a potent mix of ill-conceived products, consultants that promise the earth but fail to deliver, uneducated opportunists chasing filthy lucre and naïve consumers who are too easily satisfied by a funky dashboard. Max and Mark’s call for a professional body to outline competencies, define training, provide certification and perhaps most importantly a code of ethics is long overdue. Is anyone willing to take up the challenge in 2018?</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Similar to the Bersin by Deloitte research, this is a seminal study by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillian-pillans-3b78301/"" target=""_blank"">Gillian Pillans</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> for the <a href=""https://www.crforum.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Corporate Research Forum</a> on the state of workforce/people analytics. Its 68 pages are jam-packed with a critique on the discipline (still too much ‘HR for HR’s sake’) as well as methodologies for connecting analytics with business strategy and guidance on building organisational capability. Whilst the CRF report correctly concludes that the discipline still has a long way to go, there is also plenty to learn from and be inspired by. Several case studies are provided that really bring the power of analytics alive. There are contributions from many of the people analytics cognoscenti including <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a/"" target=""_blank"">Esther Bongenaar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232/"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicky-clement/"" target=""_blank"">Nicky Clement</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/belinda-deery-10793b37/"" target=""_blank"">Belinda Deery</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/timphaynes/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Haynes</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpholmes/"" target=""_blank"">Julian Holmes</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-kelly-2957893/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Kelly</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brydie-lear-4462a12/"" target=""_blank"">Brydie Lear</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/iain-mckendrick-7139171b/"" target=""_blank"">Iain McKendrick</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davemillner/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Millner</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/haig-r-nalbantian-466b034/"" target=""_blank"">Haig Nalbantian</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe/"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a>.

Patrick describes the four-year evolution of the people analytics function he leads at ABN AMRO. These cover evolutions in the tools and techniques used, the analytical service offered, the capabilities of the team, where the team sits within the bank (now as part of HR Strategy and Change) and how analytics has become a core component of HR’s DNA. <em>Figure 8</em> below ably demonstrates how people analytics is a core underpin in building a HR strategy that helps the business reach its goals. As ever with Patrick’s articles there is plenty to learn from and to be inspired by.</p>, <p><em>Figure 8: People Analytics as a core underpin of business and HR strategy (Source: Patrick Coolen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’m fortunate to spend most of my time speaking to and working with people analytics leaders around the world. This has helped me identify many of the common characteristics organisations that have been successful with people analytics share. These are illustrated below in <em>Figure 9</em> and described in the article. A version of this article was included in the special issue on Human Capital Analytics of the Journal of Organizational Effectiveness People and Performance (see #20), which was a proud moment for me last year.</p>, <p><em>Figure 9: The characteristics of organisations with successful people analytics capability (Source: David Green)</em></p>, <p>In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> outlines the findings of research he and the <a href=""https://rbl.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">RBL Institute</a> conducted to assess the impact of competence in HR Analytics on three outcomes: i) personal effectiveness, ii) stakeholder value, and iii) business performance. The results weren’t what we in the people analytics field would have hoped for, with the impact on business performance being fairly modest. Ulrich also notes his surprise at the findings, but offers suggestions on how to transform analytics into a sustainable and value-added HR practice. First, he confirms that analytics do matter and how used effectively can only improve decision-making. Then he recommends the need to i) focus analytics on the right business issues, ii) manage expectations by linking analytics projects to business outcomes, and iii) to build analytics on previous research. It will be fascinating to watch how business impact rises as people analytics continues to mature and becomes accepted as a core component of HR.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This terrific <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/quarterly/overview"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">McKinsey Quarterly</a> article implores HR to step out of its traditional silo mentality and embrace a new mindset of explicitly using talent to drive value rather than just responding passively to the routine needs of businesses. The authors set out a four-pronged strategy (see <em>Figure 10</em>) that places people analytics and data driven HR front and centre. The article argues that “<em>companies that take these steps will move toward a next generation of HR that’s data driven, not experience driven; systematic, not ad hoc; and consistent, not hit and miss</em>.” This is a must-read for all CHROs and augers well for the continued growth and influence of analytics in HR.</p>, <p><em>Figure 10: The CEO agenda for the 'New HR' (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> tackles arguably the most important part of people analytics and certainly one of the biggest challenges facing practitioners – ethics and privacy. The central part of the article is the revelation from a study by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> that 81% of people analytics projects (see <em>Figure 11</em>) are jeopardised by ethics and privacy concerns. Jonathan’s advice includes the need for people analytics leaders to work closely with their Chief Privacy Officer, publish a code of conduct, establish a governance council and above all put employee trust and transparency at the centre of what you do.</p>, <p><em>Figure 11: 81% of people analytics projects are jeopardised by ethics and privacy concerns (Source: Jonathan Ferrar / Insight222)</em></p>, <p>Deloitte’s <a href=""https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/focus/human-capital-trends.html?id=us:2el:3pr:dup3575:awa:cons:022817:hct17"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Global Human Capital Trends</a> is always a captivating read and the 2017 edition was no exception. People Analytics gets a whole chapter. The headline finding being that people analytics is “no longer about finding interesting information and flagging it for managers” but is now being utilised to “understand every part of a business operation” with analytical tools “being embedded into day-to-day decision making”. A detailed example from Chevron is provided, as are eight factors the authors believe are fundamental to creating a people analytics program. There are a number of invaluable insights in the report not least <em>Figure 12</em> below depicting the old and new rules of people analytics. It certainly whets the appetite for the 2018 report, which is due to be published in Q1.</p>, <p><em>Figure 12: People Analytics - Old rules vs. New rules (Source: Deloitte University Press)</em></p>, <p>This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Spence</a> is one that I regularly go back to read as it is innovative, insightful and infused throughout with Andy’s wit and dry sense of humour. It starts by telling the story of Jo and her automated coaching partner, Sirius and their trip to work in the office of the future. The examples Andy gives on the insights that Sirius offers Jo throw up plenty of questions around privacy, prediction and data sets. As Andy goes on to detail, from a technological perspective most of what he describes is already possible. However, and this is the crux, the low levels of trust most employees have in their organisations means that many of us believe that quantifying the workplace is still in the realms of science fiction. Andy’s view that “<em>the winners will not be those who enable the technology, but those who construct a new contract with employees, based on trust</em>” seems entirely plausible. An original, thought provoking and entertaining read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This HBR article presents the findings of a fascinating four-year study by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebrebele/"" target=""_blank"">Reb Rebele</a> and is a superb example of the extent of the impact ambitious people analytics projects can have on both individuals and organisations. The study examines perhaps the most important people in any organisation – the ‘givers’, how uncontrolled their generosity puts them at risk of burnout and the steps they can adopt so that they don’t wear themselves out. The advice offered (see also <em>Figure 13</em> below) broadly falls into three areas: i) be more proactive and less reactive about how you help, ii) focus on lower cost and higher impact ways of helping, and iii) be more selective rather than helping everyone with everything. For more on this subject, read Adam and Reb’s follow-up article – <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/02/more-on-being-generous-without-being-a-doormat"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">More on Being Generous Without Being a Doormat</a> and watch this <a href=""https://hbr.org/video/5270475111001/how-and-when-selflessness-at-work-backfires"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">video</a>.</p>, <p><em>Figure 13: Where are you on the generosity spectrum and 7 habits of highly productive giving - Adam Grant and Reb Rebele</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the first article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> adopt a mildly provocative stance and offer five generalisable ‘truths’ about workforce analytics. Their thinking was partly informed by the second article, which summarises the findings of research conducted by <a href=""https://www-01.ibm.com/software/smarterworkforce/institute/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">IBM’s Smarter Workforce Institute</a> and <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/news/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> into HR analytics readiness across the world. The headline finding of the research was that whilst demand from the business for workforce data and analytics is high and CHROs are increasingly supportive of this initiative, HR functions – particularly in Europe – are lagging behind. I presented highlights of the research at HR Tech World in Amsterdam in October 2017 – the deck is below.</p>, <p>One of the most prolific and best writers on people analytics is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a>. Of the many excellent articles Tracey published in 2017, I have opted for this one. The article analyses a <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/the-need-to-lead-in-data-and-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">McKinsey study</a>, which found that 86% of executives are still not getting value from analytics. Tracey focuses on the importance of the role of the analytics leader, their position within the organisation (the higher, the better), the need for them to ‘get out into the business’, and the importance of prioritisation and focus. An essential read for any current or aspiring people analytics leader.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The eminently quotable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a> has trod the path I predict many heads of people analytics will follow – all the way to the CHRO role as the practice of HR finally becomes more evidence based. This two-part article in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsumser/"" target=""_blank"">John Sumser</a>’s excellent <a href=""http://www.hrexaminer.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Examiner</a> provides the perfect roadmap for success. Part 1 outlines 10 of the key steps (see <em>Figure 14</em> below) Mark followed, whilst Part 2 looks at each of these steps in more detail. Mark’s passion, knowledge and humour shines throughout what is both a hugely enjoyable and insightful read.</p>, <p><em>Figure 14: 10 steps to evidence based HR (Source: Mark Berry, HR Examiner)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It is becoming increasingly acknowledged that we need to rethink organisational design around how work actually gets done in the 21st century. This is where Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) comes in. The opportunities this offers HR leaders and people analysts is perfectly described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> of <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> in this excellent article. Learn how ONA has evolved from a paper based process into a real time continuous flow of data that has transformed the ability of companies to map their informal networks and understand how work really gets done. Greg provides examples of how ONA/SNA can help identify influential employees, support succession planning, identify good/bad leadership behaviours (see Figure 15) and the effectiveness (or otherwise) of collaboration.</p>, <p><em>Figure 15: Quantified evidence of leaderships behaviours (Source: Greg Newman)</em></p>, <p>I always enjoy <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a>’s insightful articles on evidence-based HR. His most recent effort is one of his best. There are two aspects of the article I’d like to highlight. First, as Morten says, <em>“the purpose of evidence-based HR is not to find ‘the Right Answer’ – we are dealing with people after all. The purpose is to use all available evidence (research, internal data, analysis, experience, interviews etc.) to find the solution with the highest probability of adding the most value to your organisation.”</em> This is our best hope of mitigating the bias and prejudice inherent to varying degrees in all of us. Morten then goes on to describe an approach (see <em>Figure 16</em>), which emphasises the importance of starting with the business challenge rather than getting lost in the data.</p>, <p><em>Figure 16: The HR Value Chain (Source: Morten Kamp Andersen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dana-minbaeva-2818a35/"" target=""_blank"">Dana Minbaeva</a>, Founder of the Human Capital Analytics Group at Copenhagen Business School, muses in the first article despite overwhelming consensus that analytics and evidence based decision-making will be a mandatory part of the future, HR still isn’t quite there when it comes to widespread adoption. The ‘Why Aren’t We There Yet?’ question inspired Dana to edit a Special Issue of the Journal of Organizational Effectiveness, People and Performance on Human Capital Analytics. The special issue features a host of some of the leading thinkers in the field. Dana provides a preview of each contribution in her article. The second article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorritvandertogt/"" target=""_blank"">Jorrit van der Togt</a>, which is free to download, describes the HR analytics journey at Shell. I am grateful that Dana asked me to contribute my ‘The Best Practices to Excel at People Analytics’ article (see #8) – it is humbling to be in such esteemed company.</p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>One way to help the continued growth of people analytics is the publication of case studies so that companies can be inspired and learn from the successes others have had and apply these to their own organisations. What makes this example of a fast food restaurant chain so instructive is i) it demonstrates the power of people analytics on frontline staff, ii) the insights derived have led to dramatic improvements in customer satisfaction, service performance, and overall business results, and iii) the analysis busted a number of myths (see <em>Figure 17</em>) that had pre-existed within the organisation. Finally, the case study is in-depth, well-written and also demonstrates that one way of accelerating progress in people analytics is to partner with an external party (in this case McKinsey).</p>, <p><em>Figure 17: CASE STUDY - Employee features correlating to the desired outcomes (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Less than 20% of HR transformation programs produce the desired results. Why so, asks <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> in this excellent article? Volker then outlines the three waves of HR transformation, describing why the first two that focused on i) economies of scale, and ii) technology have largely failed. The third wave is employee-focused transformation, and this represents the opportunity for HR to reverse the death spiral. Volker describes the three elements that make up the third wave (see <em>Figure 18</em>), and introduces some interesting concepts around data ownership: i) that employees will own and manage their own master data, and ii) that companies will no longer own employee data but will have permission to use it. A fascinating idea, just like a number of others Volker outlines in the article. A must read for any organisation that is embarking or thinking of embarking on a HR transformation program.</p>, <p><em>Figure 18: Three waves of HR Transformation (left) and Three elements of Employee Focused Transformation (Right) - (Source: Volker Jacobs, TI People)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article on <a href=""https://www.hrzone.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Zone</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> draws on research from <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Power of People</a> to outline the key ingredients required to be a successful people analytics leader. The first is that the role should report to the CHRO not least as it sends a clear message that “<em>the CHRO is putting analytical decision making at the heart of the HR function</em>.” Jonathan then describes how business acumen (comprising financial literacy, political astuteness and awareness of both the internal organisation and the external marketplace) is the most important skill for people analytics leader to have. The organisations that are furthest forward with people analytics have great leaders and those that aspire to emulate these companies would do well to heed the advice Jonathan offers here.</p>, <p>One successful people analytics leader who possesses all of the attributes described by Jonathan is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, who leads the people analytics team at Microsoft. In this article, Dawn cleverly combines her twin passions of cooking and analytics to share some of the lessons she has learned as a people analytics leader. These include: the need to understand what is important for your business leaders, getting to the ‘why’ rather than stopping at the ‘what’ and the importance of knowing your audience when it comes to presenting insights in a way that will resonate. A perfect recipe! If you want to read more about the people analytics journey at Microsoft, please <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green"" target=""_blank"">read my interview with Dawn</a>.   </p>, <p>As Dawn explains in the quote above, if analytics is to become part of the DNA of HR then it simply has to embraced by HR Business Partners (HRBPs). As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman/"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a> convincingly lays out in this excellent guest post on <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a>, the long-term success of your people analytics program depends on it. The challenge is that many HRBPs are notoriously busy and not natural bedfellows for analytics. Creelman offers some invaluable advice on how to enthuse, equip and enable HRBPs and move them to the centre of your analytics equation.</p>, <p>Does engagement really drive performance? Or is it the other way round? This is a question <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> argues can be answered by people analytics. Thomas, who has led people analytics teams at Maersk Drilling, Shell and now National Australia Bank, is not one for the hyperbolic. So when he presents evidence that engagement really does drive both business and individual performance over time (2-3 years), then we should all pay attention. Indeed, Thomas writes that the potential uplift in Sales or Customer Satisfaction (NPS) is typically in the 15-25% range, which as he says is a massive opportunity.</p>, <p>Earlier articles by Michael Arena &amp; Rob Cross et al and Greg Newman provide examples of how ONA coupled with people analytics is helping firms to gain insights into what drives productivity, innovation and collaboration. Two more examples follow here. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> et al document an experiment that investigated whether gender differences in behaviour drive gender differences in outcomes at one multinational organisation. The results, which combined anonymised data from emails and <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a> sociometric badges, indicated that bias rather than differences in behaviour explained the differences in male and female promotion rates. These are not only powerful findings that demonstrate the value of people analytics, but they also highlight the fundamental challenge facing most organisations of the need to reduce bias. The second article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiparkcoll/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Arkcoll</a> describes why when looking at passive data sources for ONA, email on its own can provide an incomplete picture. Philip illustrates this perfectly in <em>Figure 19</em>, which depicts six different network relationships from different tools in one organisation.</p>, <p><em>Figure 19: networks that exist within different tools in a single organisation (Source: Philip Arkcoll)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the last 12 months <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty-94040a/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a>, who leads people analytics and measurement globally for McKinsey, has emerged as one of the best writers on people analytics and deservedly received recognition as a <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-voices-2017-uk-members-emily-spaven?"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn Top Voice</a> for 2017. Check out a helpful summary of all of Keith’s articles from 2017 <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-capital-compendium-2017-keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. In the article I’ve selected, Keith cites the advances in technology, digital and innovation as the fundamental cause of the increased hype, interest and adoption of people analytics. He then describes the opportunities these advances have enabled when it comes to understanding and analysing people: the enrichment of the digital exhaust, new people data to analyse and new ways to analyse people data. </p>, <p>Inspired by Daniel Kahneman’s monumental ‘<a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0141033576?l"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Thinking Fast and Slow</a>’ and Rolf Dobelli’s ‘<a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Thinking-Clearly-Better-Decisions/dp/1444759566/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1488280116&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+thinking+clearly+rolf+dobelli&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BOjLKXo0bRNCWI0GQrF3NMw%3D%3D"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Art of Thinking Clearly</a>’, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> summarises 15 cognitive biases that are relevant to the work and results of people analytics projects. As Tom states “<em>there is a benefit for people analytics professionals to learn more about psychology and important cognitive biases, because no one is exempt from these biases</em>”. Also check out below Tom’s video on this subject as well as Figure 20 for <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/busterbenson/"" target=""_blank"">Buster Benson</a>’s <a href=""https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cognitive Bias Sheet</a>, to which Tom refers.</p>, <p><em>Figure 20: Cognitive Bias Codex (Source: John Manoogian III and Buster Benson)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The premise of this excellent article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> is that, in the information age, people data is rapidly becoming the most valuable source of data in the business. Marr cites the spike in companies investing in technology that can measure and analyse the behaviour and performance of their employees. One example is Deloitte with their ConnectMe HR analytics platform, which is focused firmly on the needs of employees. Marr’s discussion with Deloitte principal <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gretczko/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Gretczko</a> about the platform is revealing, and we can expect to a see a flood of companies adopting similar platforms that are “tailored specifically for employees”, which “bring personalised content and experiences based on what employees need”. I concur with Marr’s quote below and believe that it distils the central theme for people analytics moving forward perfectly.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article for the <a href=""https://www.visier.com/clarity/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Visier blog</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> urges analytics leaders to use the structure and classical elements of storytelling taught by Aristotle when communicating the insights of their projects to the business. Boudreau then uses the classic story of the Three Little Pigs to walk the reader through how to tell a good HR Analytics story with all the elements required: exposition, rising action(s), climax, falling action and resolution. Insightful and fun at the same time with a nice mention for Mark Berry and Jonathan Ferrar too.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There has been a lot of talk about the use of chatbots in HR – most of it from vendors, analysts and industry influencers. It is refreshing therefore to read an article from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annaott/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Ott</a> detailing her experience of the chatbot she implemented to support the recruiting process at hub:raum (the incubator of Deutsche Telekom). The findings and observations that Anna goes on to detail are fascinating, sometimes surprising and a good source of inspiration for other practitioners looking to implement chatbots within their own organisations.</p>, <p>One of the emerging topics in people analytics and potentially one of its most important benefits is how it can underpin efforts to understand, improve and personalise the employee experience. This superb article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a> of <a href=""https://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a> outlines first why investment in people analytics is a pre-requisite and then describes three ways analytics can boost programs in this area: i) segmentation, ii) targeting and prioritising investment as well as iii) understanding and demonstrating value.</p>, <p>In this re:Work article and must-watch video, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5/"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a> asserts that research trumps best practice when it comes to making work better for employees. Unfortunately, as Prasad describes, the vast majority of HR programs simply replicate practices from other organisations. Given that each organisation has a different culture and what employees are looking for is also different, is it any surprise that many of these programs fail? Prasad provides examples of the research his people analytics team have conducted (see <em>Figure 21</em>) to help Googlers make better decisions in areas such as onboarding (by proactively seeking feedback), saving for retirement and diet. These examples all follow the principles of behavioural economics in terms of framing different choices, and all draw on the philosophies habitually used in consumer marketing.</p>, <p><em>Figure 21: Examples of people analytics projects at Google (Source: Prasad Setty, re:Work by Google)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The definitive account of the <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a> vs. LinkedIn legal battle, which grabbed attention throughout last year and is set to continue to do so in 2018. As it stands, hiQ may have won the first battle over its right to use public data from LinkedIn (i.e. the data you and me are happy to be public) within its products that help customers predict and subsequently address employee skills gaps and flight risk. However, as this captivating article from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drakepbennett/"" target=""_blank"">Drake Bennett</a> in Bloomberg Businessweek outlines, LinkedIn has filed an appeal and the saga looks set to run and run all the way to the US Supreme Court. Spare a thought for <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal/"" target=""_blank"">Darren Kaplan</a>, and the hiQ team as this case is disrupting the growth and upwards trajectory of what is one of the most impressive people analytics start-ups.

Like me they advocate that people analytics isn’t about providing insights that help HR – instead it should be about improving the organisation. In this terrific article, Rupert offers five mindsets HR should adopt to win hearts and minds within the business. Two suggestions I’d particularly like to highlight are first the need for HR to couple analytics with organisational design to answer the question “how good is my workforce in executing the business strategy?” Morrison’s idea to gamify and crowdsource the data collection and cleaning process is also quite brilliant. A must-read.</p>, <p>This pair of articles from two of the most thoughtful and acerbic writers in our space tackles two critical questions relating to people analytics and the use by organisations of employee data. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daviddsouza180/"" target=""_blank"">David D’Souza</a> examines the delicate balancing act that is embracing technology and analytics whilst at the same time being considerate to privacy and data ownership. David deliberately advocates a cautious approach (e.g. “just because it has a mutual benefit - for employee and employer - this still doesn't mean it is right”) and offers some sensible guidance on what could be permissible. In a similar vein, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/garethmjones/"" target=""_blank"">Gareth Jones</a> looks at the thorny issue of data ownership and makes a compelling case that it is owned by the employee and merely shared with the employer. With the new sources of employee data that are increasingly being captured and analysed (e.g. social capital, wearables etc) then Gareth’s call for this data to be shared with employees for their value and benefit is one many of us will agree with.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-roberts-b0217/"" target=""_blank"">Greta Roberts</a> has had an amazing start to 2018, with confirmation that her company Talent Analytics has been <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/focuses-automating-predictions-greta-roberts/"" target=""_blank"">acquired by Hire Smarter</a>. This is deserved reward for someone who has given so much to the space. Greta is an accomplished writer too and has a refreshing ‘shoot from the hip’ style. This is accurately reflected in this article where Greta pulls no punches in offering guidance on how to select a predictive HR project. Her first piece of advice to first identify a business problem to solve should be carved in stone.</p>, <p>This is an excellent read from the <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> blog by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalgradshtein-starlinks/"" target=""_blank"">Michal Gradshtein</a>, founder at ONA start up <a href=""http://www.starlinkscoming.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">StarLinks</a>, on the role of people analytics in shaping organisational culture and employee experience. Anything that evokes and combines Marty McFly (yes, THAT Marty McFly) and Voltaire, as Michal skilfully does here, is definitely worth a read. Michal likens predictive and prescriptive analytics to a ‘data-driven time machine’ in which we enter the right data and the right questions to predict the future and alter it. This comes with huge responsibilities and also a need for caution just as Doc reminded Marty in Back to the Future of the ripple effect one small intervention could have on the future. Clever, entertaining and hugely insightful – a terrific read.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Ed Houghton</a> is one of the unsung heroes driving the people analytics and data-driven HR agenda, which he does under the auspices of the <a href=""https://www.cipd.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CIPD</a>. In the first article, he sets out why the impact of HR needs to be framed through a risk lens as well as the opportunity lens through which we traditionally view the discipline. Naturally, as Ed goes on to say, this approach needs to be founded on getting measurement right and applying analytics. Ed then nicely links the article to recent research he led for the CIPD together with Warwick Business School and University of Kansas School of Business, which examines the extent that human capital data is used in investment decisions (see video below, which demonstrates the key findings of the research).  </p>, <p>That's all for 2017.

David R. Green,"January 9, 2018",75+ Conferences on People Analytics & Data-Driven HR to attend in 2018,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/75-conferences-people-analytics-data-driven-hr-attend-david-green/,"[<p>When I last collated <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/22-conferences-people-analytics-attend-201617-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">a list of conferences</a> dedicated to or prominently featuring people analytics in 2016, I found 24 conferences around the world – and I remember at the time being surprised to find that many.</p>, <p>Fast forward two years, with 2018 in its infancy and people analytics accelerating from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-reasons-why-people-analytics-central-future-hr-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">the periphery to the core of the HR agenda</a>, it seems an appropriate time to provide a new summary of conferences that will take place in 2018. Perhaps a significant indicator of the growth in the interest and adoption of people analytics is the fact that I have found 75+ conferences - over three times as many as I found just 18 months ago.</p>, <p>Having spoken at numerous conferences across the world on people analytics in the last 18 months in cities such as Sydney, Singapore, San Francisco, New York, London, Helsinki, Moscow, Berlin, Paris, Hamburg, Oslo, Stockholm, Philadelphia and Las Vegas, I was actually not surprised to find that the number of conferences had risen to such a high figure. </p>, <p>The article is split into two halves. First, I have featured the conferences where I am already confirmed to speak in 2018. Then, I have listed in chronological order the 2018 conferences that are either dedicated to people analytics or where the subject prominently features on the agenda.</p>, <p>I plan to update this article on at least a monthly basis throughout the year, so if you’d like the conference you are organising or speaking at to be featured then please add details and a link in the comments section of this article.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-finally-grows-up-josh-bersin/"" target=""_blank"">In a recent article</a>, Josh Bersin stated that <strong>“<em>CEOs and CHROs now understand that people analytics is a vital part of running a high performing company</em>.”</strong> This is consistent with what I believe as well as what many other people I speak to in the space tell me they are seeing. Given that analytics underpins many of the trends in the people space (e.g. employee experience, sentiment analysis, consumerisation and organisational network analysis), this is hardly a surprise. As such, I expect 2018 will be a significant year with regards to the continued growth of people analytics and data-driven HR. Conferences are one way to help engage, educate and inspire practitioners to embrace and then excel at data-driven HR.</p>, <p>In date order…</p>, <p>One of the Holy Trinity of people analytics conferences, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a>’s PAFOW conference series is “<em>created by leaders and practitioners for leaders and practitioners</em>.” I’ve had the privilege of co-chairing PAFOW since January 2017 and once again Al has gathered the crème de la crème of leading practitioners, thinkers and vendors in the space for the flagship San Francisco event on 1-2 February.

This is probably why many people analytics leaders are having employee engagement and experience added to their remit. As such, I’m looking forward to delivering a keynote speech on people analytics at the Employee Experience Bootcamp in Lisbon in February.

David R.

This augurs well for the continued growth of the discipline in 2018 particularly as there is increasing realisation that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-reasons-why-people-analytics-central-future-hr-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">analytics is at the centre of the future HR function</a>. The penny seems to have finally dropped with, in the words of Josh Bersin, “<em>CEOs and CHROs now understand that people analytics is a vital part of running a high performing company</em>”.</p>, <p>This issue features some of the most revered names in our space. In addition to the aforementioned Bersin, there are contributions from Dave Ulrich, John Boudreau, Adam Grant, Alec Levenson, Rob Cross, Tom Haak, Bernard Marr, Tracey Smith, Max Blumberg, Jonathan Ferrar and Al Adamsen as well as several articles by practitioners. The subjects covered span the gamut of a people analytics space that is broadening its scope and deepening its impact.</p>, <p>For the eagle-eyed amongst you, yes I know December hasn’t finished yet but rest assured that I’ll pick up any as of yet unpublished gems in the ‘Best of 2017’ article I will ready for January.</p>, <p>It also hasn’t slipped my notice that we are approaching Christmas, so before we get to the 20 articles that feature this time, I wanted to offer a gem of a hors d’oeuvre from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a>.

If you are even remotely interested in people analytics and you are not a <a href=""https://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin</a> member, you simply must beg, steal or borrow a copy of Madhura’s fabulous report. Its 71 pages are packed full of insights, case studies and advice to improve the impact of your people analytics function. Highlights include the seven top findings for driving high-impact people analytics (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) and also a dramatic update and overhaul of Bersin’s infamous people analytics maturity model (see Josh's article). Josh’s article covers some of the report’s main findings and concludes that people analytics has finally grown up and is now an established function within the business. </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: Top findings from High-Impact people analytics research (Source: Bersin by Deloitte) </em></p>, <p>Like the Bersin report, the second entry from the <a href=""https://www.crforum.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Corporate Research Forum</a> is also a landmark study on the state of workforce/people analytics. Its 68 pages are jam-packed with a critique on the discipline (still too much ‘HR for HR’s sake’) as well as methodologies for connecting analytics with business strategy and strategies for building organisational capability. Whilst the CRF report correctly concludes that the practice still has a long way to go, there is also plenty to learn from and be inspired by. Several case studies are provided that really bring the power of analytics alive. There are contributions from many of the people analytics cognoscenti including <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a>, Esther Bongenaar, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232/"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, Nicky Clement, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/belinda-deery-10793b37/"" target=""_blank"">Belinda Deery</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/timphaynes/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Haynes</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpholmes/"" target=""_blank"">Julian Holmes</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-kelly-2957893/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Kelly</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brydie-lear-4462a12/"" target=""_blank"">Brydie Lear</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/iain-mckendrick-7139171b/"" target=""_blank"">Iain McKendrick</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davemillner/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Millner</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/haig-r-nalbantian-466b034/"" target=""_blank"">Haig Nalbantian</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe/"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a>.

It is quite a sobering read on the potential shifts in occupations over the next few years. As <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> below indicates, the worst case scenario sees 800 million workers potentially displaced by 2030. This preview of the report tackles five questions including: what impact automation will have, whether there will be enough jobs in the future and what is the impact of automation on skills and wages. The full report is an absolute treasure trove of information and definitely one to try and wade through over the holiday period. The issues raised will play a large part in the future role of people analytics teams.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Automation will have a far-reaching effect on the global workforce (Source: McKinsey Global Institute)</em></p>, <p>This is another important article by the ever-reliable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>. In this first instalment of what promises to be a terrific three-part series, Max explains the rationale for using the scientific method in people analytics (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below). He cites examples from R&amp;D and marketing where A/B Testing is routinely used to demonstrate which campaign will deliver the greatest return on investment. So why do so few companies use the scientific method in the HR domain? As Max says it is remarkable, given the habitual use by companies in other business areas and it is undoubtedly one of the factors holding people analytics back. Max also offers some forthright and compelling reasons why HR has been slow to embrace the scientific method. It’s a must read and portends well for the rest of the series.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Proving that a compensation program leads to a desired outcome (Source: Max Blumberg)</em></p>, <p>Does engagement really drive performance? Or is it the other way round? This is a question, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> opines in this article, which can be answered by people analytics. Thomas, who has led people analytics teams at Maersk Drilling, Shell and now National Australia Bank, is not one for the hyperbolic. So when he presents evidence that engagement really does drive both business and individual performance over time (2-3 years), then we should all pay attention. Indeed, Thomas writes that the potential uplift in Sales or Customer Satisfaction (NPS) is typically in the 15-25% range, which as he says is a massive opportunity.</p>, <p>I always enjoy <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>’s musings on analytics and the HR discipline in general. Partly because Mark calls it as he sees it, but also because he invariably uncovers a golden nugget of insight that others have either missed or not explained well enough. This certainly proves to be the case in this superb piece for <a href=""https://www.hrexaminer.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Examiner</a> where Mark explains that the much vaunted mantra that analytics projects should have business relevance is on its own not enough. To relevance, Mark adds the extra ingredient of ‘receptivity’ i.e. business leaders that will actually act on the findings derived from analytics projects. His three tips on how to improve receptivity are both practical and valuable.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> is not only one of the most prolific writers on people analytics, she is also one of the best. Moreover, similar to Mark Berry, Tracey refreshingly does not pull any punches. In this article, Tracey looks at three challenges facing HR Analysts: i) disparate systems producing multiple data sets, ii) the GDPR, and; iii) accessing data sets outside HR. In each case, Tracey calmly distils the challenge before offering wise and practical advice. Above all, as Tracey explains, having the right mindset, developing a thick skin and having a ‘failure is not an option’ approach is critical to thriving in this challenging discipline.  </p>, <p>This pair of articles from two of the most thoughtful and acerbic writers in our space tackle two critical questions relating to people analytics and the use by organisations of employee data. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daviddsouza180/"" target=""_blank"">David D’Souza</a> examines the delicate balancing act that is embracing technology and analytics whilst at the same time being considerate to privacy and data ownership. David deliberately advocates a cautious approach (e.g. “<em>just because it has a mutual benefit - for employee and employer - this still doesn't mean it is right</em>”) and offers some sensible guidance on what could be permissible. In a similar vein, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/garethmjones/"" target=""_blank"">Gareth Jones</a> looks at the thorny issue of data ownership and makes a compelling case that it is owned by the employee and merely shared with the employer. With the new sources of employee data that are increasingly being captured and analysed (e.g. social capital, wearables etc) then Gareth’s call for this data to be shared with employees for their value and benefit is one many of us will agree with.</p>, <p>As collaboration and multi-teaming continues to rise, this is a timely article on how to avoid some of the potential consequent pitfalls such as burnout, lack of cohesion and trust erosion facing employees, teams and leaders if they get this delicate art wrong. The authors, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/profmortensen/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Mortensen</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidi-k-gardner-ab5b825/"" target=""_blank"">Heidi K. Gardner</a> provide a case study of a professional services firm (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below) to highlight the problem. Then they recommend some priorities for team leaders (e.g. map team member skills, foster trust and familiarity, create a learning environment) and organisational leaders (e.g. map and analyse human capital interdependence, promote knowledge flows) to create an environment where multi-teaming thrives.</p>, <p><em>Figure 6: Source 'The Overcommitted Organisation', Harvard Business Review</em></p>, <p>This is an excellent read from the <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> blog by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalgradshtein-starlinks/"" target=""_blank"">Michal Gradshtein</a>, founder at ONA start up <a href=""http://www.starlinkscoming.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">StarLinks</a>, on the role of people analytics in shaping organisational culture and employee experience. Anything that evokes and combines Marty McFly (yes, THAT Marty McFly) and Voltaire, as Michal skilfully does here, is definitely worth a read. Michal likens predictive and prescriptive analytics to a ‘<em>data-driven time machine</em>’ to which we enter the right data and the right questions to predict the future and alter it. This comes with huge responsibilities and also a need for caution just as Doc reminded Marty in Back to the Future of the ripple effect one small intervention could have on the future. Clever, entertaining and hugely insightful – a terrific read. </p>, <p>From Voltaire to Aristotle: in this article for the <a href=""https://www.visier.com/clarity/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Visier blog</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> urges analytics leaders to use the structure and classical elements of storytelling taught by Aristotle when communicating the insights of their projects to the business. Boudreau then uses the classic story of the Three Little Pigs to walk the reader through how to tell a good HR Analytics story with all the elements required: exposition, rising action(s), climax, falling action and resolution. Insightful and fun at the same time with a nice mention for Mark Berry and Jonathan Ferrar too.</p>, <p>For those of you staking your chips on the ‘C’ in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugeneburke/"" target=""_blank"">Eugene Burke</a>’s excellent article on the <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tucana blog</a> being ‘Change' you are wrong. Instead, the ‘C’ in question stands for ‘Culture’. Eugene cites the example of a recent meeting of 100 leading CEOs organised by IBM’s Ginni Rometty, where there was general agreement that “t<em>he biggest problem they face (with regards to innovation) is not technology, but rather creating a culture that can embrace and adapt to technological change</em>.” Eugene then conjures up images of Charles Dickens by regaling a tale of two companies – one recognised for a culture that enables innovation to thrive and one where these elements had historically been misaligned. In the latter a focus on using people analytics to understand and then enable the right behaviours to foster innovation is now starting to pay dividends.</p>, <p>Not one, not two but articles by three of the world’s top people analytics leaders. First up, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a/"" target=""_blank"">Esther Bongenaar</a> outlines the research Shell’s people analytics team have completed in conjunction with Erasmus University on diversity and inclusion. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicky-clement/"" target=""_blank"">Nicky Clement</a> reflects on the people analytics journey at Unilever and the boost achieved through working closely with other analytics teams in the business. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, reflecting on her experience of building the team at Microsoft, focuses on the need to adjust the mix of skills in your team over time to reflect not only where you are on your journey, but also the unique needs of your organisation.</p>, <p>The definitive (if misleadingly titled) account of the <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a> vs. LinkedIn legal battle, which has grabbed attention throughout 2017. As it stands, hiQ may have won the first battle over its right to use public data from LinkedIn (i.e. the data you and me are happy to be public) within its products that help customers predict and subsequently address employee skills gaps and flight risk. However, as this captivating article from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drakepbennett/"" target=""_blank"">Drake Bennett</a> in Bloomberg Businessweek outlines, LinkedIn has filed an appeal and the saga looks set to continue in 2018 and beyond. Spare a thought for <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal/"" target=""_blank"">Darren Kaplan</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/weidick/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Weidick</a> and the hiQ team as this case is disrupting the growth and upwards trajectory of what is one of the most impressive people analytics start-ups in the burgeoning vendor space. For more on the battle, check out the <a href=""https://www.chadcheese.com/single-post/2017/11/30/Talkin-hiQ-vs-LinkedIn-with-Mark-Weidick-CEO-hiQ---A-Nexxt-Exclusive-Podcast"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chad &amp; Cheese Podcast</a> of a couple of weeks back with Mark Weidick, CEO of hiQ.</p>, <p>Do you know what a HiPPO is? According to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> it stands for ‘<strong><em>Hi</em></strong>ghest <strong><em>P</em></strong>aid <strong><em>P</em></strong>erson’s <strong><em>O</em></strong>pinion’, and is one of the biggest barriers to more evidence-based and data-driven decision-making in our companies. Sadly, I think this is something particularly contagious and rife within HR and people analytics. In this article, Bernard describes what the HiPPO effect is, why it is so dangerous and most important of all how to tame the HiPPO.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Ed Houghton</a> is one of the unsung heroes driving the people analytics and data-driven HR agenda, which he does under the auspices of the <a href=""https://www.cipd.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CIPD</a>. In the first article, he sets out the why the impact of HR needs to be framed through a risk lens as well as the opportunity lens through which we traditionally view the discipline. Naturally, as Ed goes on to say, this approach needs to be founded on getting measurement right and applying analytics. Ed then nicely links the article to recent research he led for the CIPD together with Warwick Business School and University of Kansas School of Business, which examines the extent to human capital data is used in investment decisions (see video below, which demonstrates the key findings of the research).  </p>, <p>In this piece for Personnel Today, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> examines the role of analytics plays in creating cultures that retain the best people and foster productivity. First, he describes the economic challenges, changing employee expectations and technological advances that are changing the game for HR but also present the function with the opportunity to increase its impact. A major contributor to this is data coupled with people analytics. Jonathan then gives examples of how analytics can empower employees, managers and organisations. For the latter, Jonathan describes how companies are now measuring and analysing the behaviours that underpin corporate culture. Expect to see a significant rise in the use of behavioural analytics in the workplace in 2018.</p>, <p>I’ve featured a number of articles and case studies on Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) in this series throughout 2017. When I speak to people analytics leaders, ONA is the innovation that they are most interested in, so I expect 2018 to see interest in this fascinating area grow. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> is perhaps the world’s leading authority on active ONA. In this article he describes how one company used ONA to promote innovation between two groups of scientists by realising the need to create a culture of ‘adaptive space’. As active ONA comes back into vogue, we are also seeing the emergence of passive ONA, one exponent of this is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> and his company <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a>. In his article, Ben examines the popular cult of productivity and how it is group rather than individual output that companies should be striving for. The example Ben cites of a highly networked internal expert enabling their colleagues to complete their tasks 66% quicker is the perfect example of the value that can be generated through ONA.</p>, <p>There are a plethora of articles predicting what is going to happen in the HR space in 2018 and the vast majority are hocus-pocus, but there are some notable exceptions. The four that particularly resonated with me came from Josh Bersin, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> (see video below) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveweisbeck/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Weisbeck</a>.

First up, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a> interviews <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremywelland/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Welland</a>, Global Head of People Analytics at PayPal, for an engrossing discussion.

David R. Green,"December 11, 2017",The role of People Analytics in recruiting,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-people-analytics-recruiting-david-green/,"[<p>A few months ago I had the privilege of speaking to close to 500 delegates at the <a href=""https://www.socialrecruitingdays.de/en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Social Recruiting Days</a> conference in Berlin about the role of people analytics in recruiting.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/10342362/"" target=""_blank"">Quadriga</a>, the conference organisers recorded my speech and have now made it available.

Nevertheless, the fact I was set to deliver the speech in Berlin was not lost on me. The day before Social Recruiting Days I visited some of the places Bowie frequented during his time in the city in the late 1970s including Hansa studios. This is where Bowie created some of his best music – the ‘Berlin Trilogy’ of Low (quite possibly the greatest album ever - listen for yourself below), Heroes and Lodger. Given <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/seven-lessons-hr-can-learn-from-david-bowie-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">I am a huge Bowie fan</a>, you’ll just have to forgive my self-indulgence.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Finally, I’d like to thank <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-daniel-74821a102/"" target=""_blank"">Martin Daniel</a> and the Quadriga / Social Recruiting Days team for inviting me to speak at the event and for also recording the speech even if watching oneself on stage can be an uncomfortable experience.

Naturally, these are the topics that CEOs and business leaders really care about. This means that people analytics is now “<em>business critical, mandatory and must be supported well</em>.” Look out for Bersin by Deloitte’s High-Impact People Analytics research, which has been led by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a> and which will be published in the coming weeks. </p>, <p><em>See Josh Bersin's recent presentation of the trends disrupting the HR Technology market and the consequent move to the mainstream of HR for people analytics</em></p>, <p>In this must-watch video, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5/"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a> asserts that research trumps best practice when it comes to making work better for employees. Unfortunately, as Prasad describes, the vast majority of HR programs simply replicate practices from other organisations. Given that each organisation has a different culture and what employees are looking for is also different, is it any surprise that many of these programs fail? Prasad provides examples of the research his people analytics team have conducted (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) to help Googlers make better decisions in areas such as onboarding (by proactively seeking feedback), saving for retirement and diet. These examples all follow the principles of behavioural economics in terms of framing different choices, and all draw on the philosophies habitually used in consumer marketing.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: Examples of people analytics projects at Google (Source: Prasad Setty, re:Work by Google)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Along with Jonathan Ferrar, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> this year published <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Power of People</a> book, which has rapidly become the Bible of people analytics. In this article, Nigel and Sheri adopt a mildly provocative stance and offer five generalisable ‘truths’ (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below) about workforce analytics based on their research and experience. The article has already prompted some lively debate, so it will be interesting to see how this continues to develop.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2: </em></strong><em>5 Truths about Workforce Analytics (Source: Nigel Guenole &amp; Sheri Feinzig, inspired in part by the findings of their</em><strong><em> </em></strong><a href=""http://ibm.biz/HRready"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>HR Analytics Readiness</em></a><em> white paper</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I always enjoy <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a>’s insightful (but alas these days all too infrequent) articles on evidence-based HR. His most recent effort is one of his best. There are two aspects of the article I’d like to highlight. First, as Morten says, <em>“the purpose of evidence-based HR is not to find ‘the Right Answer’ – we are dealing with people after all. The purpose is to use all available evidence (research, internal data, analysis, experience, interviews etc.) to find the solution with the highest probability of adding the most value to your organisation.”</em> This is our best hope of mitigating the bias and prejudice inherent to varying degrees in all of us. Morten then goes on to describe an approach (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>), which emphasises the importance of starting with the business challenge rather than getting lost in the data.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3: </em></strong><em>The HR Value Chain (Source: Morten Kamp Andersen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>My summary of the East Coast edition of the People Analytics &amp; Future of Work (PAFOW) conference features insights from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe/"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetanjali-gamel-17209b68/"" target=""_blank"">Geetanjali Gamel</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite/"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamgaker/"" target=""_blank"">Will Gaker</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbroderickchicago/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Broderick</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-hawley-3616023/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Hawley</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-sparkman-msc-mba-mhr-12710b14/"" target=""_blank"">Ross Sparkman</a>. As is typical with PAFOW events, the two days were a vibrant mix of education, inspiration and exploration as speakers, delegates and sponsors sought to share and collaborate to push the envelope on what could be possible with people analytics. The early program for PAFOW San Francisco on 1-2 February 2018 is up <a href=""http://pafow.com/w128/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and with the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-whiteman-ph-d-02a8097/"" target=""_blank"">Heather Whiteman</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-nagy-6b5a73b/"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Nagy</a> already confirmed as speakers it promises to raise the bar even higher. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4: </em></strong><em>Two of the presentations at PAFOW Philadelphia. On the left, Al Adamsen described how people analytics is evolving from a focus on employees to a broader ecosystem of work. Whilst on the right, Geetanjali Gamel spoke about some of the options for career development for people analytics professionals </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> spoke at PAFOW about arguably the most important part of people analytics and certainly one of the biggest challenges facing practitioners – ethics and privacy. This article captures and expands upon the points Jonathan made in Philadelphia including the revelation from a recent study by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> that 81% of people analytics projects (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>) are jeopardised by ethics and privacy concerns. Jonathan’s advice includes the need for people analytics leaders to work closely with their Chief Privacy Officer, publish a code of conduct, establish a governance council and above all put employee trust and transparency at the centre of what you do.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: 81% of people analytics projects are jeopardised by ethics and privacy concerns (Source: Jonathan Ferrar / Insight222)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnold-birkhoff-570336/"" target=""_blank"">Arnold Birkhoff</a> on the <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> blog builds on the finding from the Insight222 research referenced in the preceding article. Birkhoff argues that this already high figure is set to deteriorate further if companies don’t get their act together in time of the EU’s enhanced privacy legislation –the General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into force in May 2018. Birkhoff then provides perhaps the best explanation I have read yet on GDPR from a HR context and how people analytics leaders can ready themselves and their organisations for this new legislation.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Josh Bersin’s article describes how ONA coupled with people analytics is helping firms to gain insights into what drives productivity, performance and collaboration within their businesses. This next two articles and the three presented at #18 all provide examples of ONA. First up, this piece in HBR by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> et al documents an experiment that investigated whether gender differences in behaviour drive gender differences in outcomes at one multinational organisation. The results, which combined anonymised data from emails and <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a> sociometric badges, indicated that bias rather than differences in behaviour explained the differences in male and female promotion rates. These are not only powerful findings that demonstrate the value of people analytics, but they also highlight the fundamental challenge facing most organisations of the need to reduce bias.  </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> highlights in this fascinating article, the Saratoga Institute advises that the average cost to business of employee turnover is 12% of pre-tax income and that for some firms this figure rises to 40%. So why, when an employee announces their intention to resign, are so many decisions on whether to retain the employee or let them go made on gut and opinion? Newman suggests that prioritising social capital data over traditional static human capital data provides a much better basis for an informed decision. He then goes on to illustrate through network analysis (see examples in <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below) how this can provide insights on the employee’s leadership potential, network size, relationship strength (internal and external) and impact as well as the network disruption that would be caused should s/he leave the organisation. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6: </em></strong><em>Rosalee is central to a large internal network, these are the people that she is influencing, leading, working, collaborating and innovating with (Source: Greg Newman)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As this cover article from HBR states, GE has transformed its business under the tenure of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffimmelt/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Immelt</a> with 50% of its 300,000 employees having been with the company for less than five years. People analytics and algorithms have been central to helping this new talent assimilate and thrive with former head of people analytics and planning <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesgallman/"" target=""_blank"">James Gallman</a> explaining that the matching technology “<em>can take a person and match him or her to something else: online or conventional educational programs, another person, or a job.</em>” The article then goes on to outline how analytics is enabling the employee lifecycle in areas such as career development and succession, training, high potentials, retention, networking and even in supporting cultural change.    </p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>Before we continue with numbers 11-20, a quick interlude. Those who tuned in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-jul-aug-2017-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">last time</a> will have seen that I featured the <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a> vs. LinkedIn legal battle. At the time, the former had just won what we now know was the first battle over its right to use public data from LinkedIn (i.e. the data you and me are happy to be public) within its products that help customers predict and subsequently address employee skills gaps and flight risk.</p>, <p>Naturally I hope that the two parties, both of whom I have the utmost respect for, are able to come to a mutual agreement that suits both. However, it seems that the case will likely run and run all the way to the US Supreme Court.</p>, <p>The case has ramifications that go way beyond the world of people analytics and ultimately will define if public data on the Internet really is ‘public’ and who has the right to use and access it.</p>, <p>Moreover, the very survival of hiQ Labs is at stake as it faces a David vs. Goliath contest and crippling legal costs to continue its fight. As such, hiQ Labs has started a crowdjustice appeal to raise $100,000 towards its legal costs. If you’d like to find out more and/or contribute, please <a href=""https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/hiq/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">click here</a> or on the image below. Whatever happens, I’ll continue covering the story here and how the twists and turns of the legal battle play out.  </p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>This is both an honest and insightful piece by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a>, who has previously published a number of excellent articles in concert with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a>. Here, Alexis describes her realisation that there are four rather than three areas of expertise required for successful analytics projects highlighting ‘influencing’ alongside expertise in content, data and analytics. As Alexis explains as a scientist, this was tough for her to swallow, as good results should speak for themselves! Influencing means working with stakeholders to select the right projects at the outset right through to identifying actions from the insights that are feasible, effective and that will be endorsed. An invaluable read. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This article distils the findings of a master thesis on how to bridge the gap between people analytics and decision-making, which as the authors correctly identify is a significant challenge for many practitioners. The advice offered is centred on the need for more effective collaboration between people analytics teams and HRBPs, which is illustrated below in <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong>. The further commentary offered in the article provides in my view a sensible starting point for organisations seeking to enthuse, equip and enable their HRBPs from an analytics perspective.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7: </em></strong><em>Steps required to bridge the gap between analytics and decision-making (Source: Asbjørn Bloch Jensen &amp; Marco Höpfl)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The second entry on this collection for <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>, who has been somewhat of a prolific writer over the last few months. This article focuses on storytelling – a critical but often scarce skill when it comes to people analytics. Too many projects fail because they are not communicated in a way that resonates with their intended audience. Jonathan emphasises the need to tailor your message depending on the analytics expertise of your audience (see <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong> below), and provides a host of other invaluable tips to improve your storytelling skills.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 8: </em></strong><em>Four essential audience categories for analytics storytelling (Source: The Power of People by Nigel Guenole, Jonathan Ferrar and Sheri Feinzig)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There has been a surge of interest in employee experience as organisations seek to apply the success of their customer experience programs to their workforce. In this piece, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a> describes the three elements she believes are required to understand, track and improve the employee experience. These are i) a continuous listening strategy, ii) cross-functional data sharing, and iii) investing in analytical skills or strategic partnerships, which are all included in <strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong> below.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 9: </em></strong><em>The critical components of an Employee Experience program (Source: iNostix by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst demand from the business for workforce data and analytics is high and CHROs are increasingly supportive of this initiative, HR functions – particularly in Europe – are lagging behind. This was the headline finding of the <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/news/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> / <a href=""https://www-01.ibm.com/software/smarterworkforce/institute/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">IBM Smarter Workforce Institute</a> research I presented recently at HR Tech World in Amsterdam (see <strong><em>Slideshare</em></strong> below). A link to the white paper is provided above, along with articles by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcarty/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Carty</a> and me, which provide commentary on the research findings. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I expect that this article will prove to be very popular as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/senguptaraja/"" target=""_blank"">Raja Sengupta</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunilmeharia/"" target=""_blank"">Sunil Meharia</a> demystify statistics by answering 19 questions typically asked by practitioners just about to embark on their analytics journeys. As the authors opine, without grasping the fundamentals of statistics you cannot capitalise on the huge potential of people analytics. File under mandatory reading, and take a look also at <strong><em>Figure 10</em></strong> below, which the authors use to highlight the risks associated with statistics if not applied properly. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 10: </em></strong><em>A rough guide to spotting bad science (Source: Compound Interest 2015)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing the statistics theme, this entry is definitely one for the technically and statistically minded. The article sees three members of Shell’s rightly revered HR Analytics team (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a/"" target=""_blank"">Esther</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/vgiagkoulas/"" target=""_blank"">Vasileios</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindav4/"" target=""_blank"">Linda</a>) collaborating with academia (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulvanderlaken/"" target=""_blank"">Paul</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/zsuzsa-bakk-4881b05b/"" target=""_blank"">Zsuzsa</a>) to make the case for two statistical methods rarely used in the HR analytics space. The paper explains the virtues of latent bathtub models (see <strong><em>Figure 11</em></strong>), and optimal matching analysis, and it is a fascinating read – even for this untrained eye! </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 11: </em></strong><em>A bathtub model of the mediating effect of employee engagement in the relationship between leadership training and team performance (Source: Wiley)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing the ONA theme from earlier, these three articles describe how the technique is being used by organisations. First, Tushman et al describe how EY is analysing email and calendar data to help clients predict the likelihood of retaining key talent following an acquisition and how they can subsequently develop strategies to maximise retention. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-hariharan-57103097/"" target=""_blank"">Aditya Hariharan</a>’s excellent piece examines how ONA can help organisations identify and mitigate network disruption. Lastly, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiparkcoll/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Arkcoll</a> focuses on how ONA can be used to improve team productivity. These are three superb articles.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 12: </em></strong><em>Diagram comparing time spent on collaboration between team members inside a team with collaboration between the team and other parts of an organization (Source: Philip Arcoll, Worklytics)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There has been an explosion of interest in how wearable technologies and sensors can be used in the workplace with the debate centred on the need to balance ethics/privacy with employee/organisational benefit. The first three articles all touch on the possibilities and perils these technologies offer. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mschrage/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Schrage</a>’s excellent piece focuses on how sensors can be used to measure mental health in the workplace. Next <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geof-wheelwright-3a61928/"" target=""_blank"">Geof Wheelwright</a> reveals how sensory technology from <a href=""http://www.smartcaptech.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">SmartCap Technologies</a> helps detect ‘microsleeps’ in truck drivers and other operators of heavy machinery. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissalang/"" target=""_blank"">Marissa Lang</a>’s article contains an interesting view from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> that more regulation is needed in this burgeoning area. Given some of the examples of technology that Lang’s article exposes, I think he is right. Finally, <a href=""https://twitter.com/TCassauwers"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Cassauwers</a> (featuring some sage views from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgivre/"" target=""_blank"">Charles Givre</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabina-leonelli-a878673b/"" target=""_blank"">Sabina Leonelli</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakemetcalf/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Metcalf</a>) ponders whether data science needs its equivalent of the Hippocratic oath.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Finally, some analytics-themed inspiration from outside the HR realm: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesca-gino-b7139436/"" target=""_blank"">Francesca Gino</a> writes on the rise of behavioural economics and its increasing influence on organisations (see earlier example from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5/"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a> on how Google’s people analytics team is applying this). Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/loribieda/"" target=""_blank"">Lori C. Bieda</a> outlines common challenges facing many analytics teams (not just in HR) of i) demand (for analytics) outstripping supply (of analytical talent), ii) organisational immaturity, and iii) the promise of technology vs. the reality of data, and how leaders can navigate the path of disillusionment these challenges can bring. Next the McKinsey article (Richard Kelly et al) outlines seven rules manufacturers should follow with regards to IoT-enabled analytics, much of which has resonance for HR including rule #2 <em>‘capture the right data, not just more data’</em> and rule #4 <em>‘focus on outcomes not technology.’</em> Lastly, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-garton-07b6a1/"" target=""_blank"">Eric Garton</a> argues that our chronic underinvestment in people has led to our systemic problem with productivity. People analytics can help our leaders identify, measure and quantify the optimal areas of investment in human capital, so this seems like a good place to sign off until next time.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If podcasts are your thing then the last two months has seen a flood of excellent people data related gems. Here’s six of them.

One delegate (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/simoncockayne/"" target=""_blank"">Simon Cockayne</a>) captured the mood perfectly by describing the “<em>effervescent curiosity</em>” of all those attending.</p>, <p>Before we dive into the key takeaways, a word for <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> who surpassed even his own usual impeccable standards in the programming and facilitation of the event. People Analytics &amp; Future of Work (PAFOW) is one of the holy trinity of conferences on the discipline along with the Wharton People Analytics Conference and Tucana’s People Analytics World and People Analytics Forum conferences. That is down to Al, who is one of the most knowledgeable and passionate people in the world when it comes to people analytics and the possibilities it offers to businesses and employees. It was an honour for me to co-chair such a fabulous event.</p>, <p><em>Closing the People Analytics &amp; Future of Work conference in Philadelphia, co-Chairs Al Adamsen (R) and David Green (L) reflect on a memorable two days </em></p>, <p>In his opening address, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> highlighted one of the key challenges of people analytics in striking a balance between driving better business outcomes at the same time as helping improve employee experience and wellbeing. This already delicate balancing act is further complicated as the people analytics discipline begins to expand its remit from providing insights and analysing the experience of full-time and prospective employees to the wider ecosystem of work as illustrated in <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below. This concurs with my own view that people analytics is moving from the periphery towards the centre of the future HR function. How this impacts the role of HR, and specifically people analytics teams will be a critical question over the coming years. Al also announced the creation of <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a>, which I will come back to later.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1: </em></strong><em>People analytics is evolving from a focus on employees to a broader ecosystem of work (Source: Al Adamsen/Insight222)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>PAFOW once again highlighted the high calibre of talent in the people analytics space. The possibilities people analytics offers continues to attract new blood to the discipline such as economist <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a>, recently appointed as Head of People Analytics at Capital One. Guru provided a refreshing and captivating talk on the diminishing half-life of skills and the consequent impact on workforce planning. The answer, according to Guru, cannot be solely provided through recruiting, although hiring for aptitude and growth mindset is likely to become increasingly more important. Guru believes, as do I, that the answer lies in raising the focus on learning – and people analytics can help immensely here by providing the foundation to programs that identify, personalise and deliver the right learning at the right time to the right individuals in an organisation. This is but one example of the broadening of the remit of people analytics that Al referred to in his opening address.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2: </em></strong><em>Calculating 'engaged' human capital (Source: Guru Sethupathy)</em></p>, <p><em>PAFOW Speakers (from L to R): Arun Chidambaram, Jonathan Ferrar and Ian O'Keefe</em></p>, <p>One sign that people analytics is maturing as a discipline is that instead of speakers providing tips on how to get started, the focus was very much on how to build sustainable capability in people analytics within organisations. This was something that a number of speakers including <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe/"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a> (JP Morgan Chase), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-hawley-3616023/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Hawley</a> (Unilever), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a> (Pfizer) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetanjali-gamel-17209b68/"" target=""_blank"">Geetanjali Gamel</a> (Merck) spent a significant part of their presentations on. Some of their combined advice included:</p>, <p><strong>Set a clearly defined vision and mission</strong> - to create an identity and mobilise the team, and also communicate to the business what your purpose is. See example of Merck’s as presented by Geetanjali in <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3: </em></strong><em>Merck's mission statement for its people analytics team (Source: Geetanjali Gamel)</em></p>, <p><strong>Collaborate with other analytics teams in the business</strong> – not only to augment the skills and capabilities in your own team but also to get access to additional data sources so you can combine forces to solve key business challenges facing the organisation.</p>, <p><strong>Invest in enabling the wider HR and HRBP community</strong> – this is critical in developing sustainable capability. A number of speakers described how they had created training (classroom and social), community of practices and advocates outside the core team.</p>, <p><strong>Don’t forget the basics </strong>– This was a point emphasised by Ben Hawley in that you will quickly lose credibility in the business if for example you provide inaccurate data on FTE. Similarly, Ian O’Keefe stressed the importance of an analytics strategy being underpinned by a measurement strategy.</p>, <p><strong>Focus on developing your team</strong> - Arun Chidambaram struck a chord when he described how the demand for mid-career people analytics practitioners far outstrips their supply. This demonstrates the importance for organisations in defining career paths for their analytics teams. The focus of Geetanjali Gamel’s presentation was very much on this subject, and <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> below illustrates some of the possible career paths for people in our discipline.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4: </em></strong><em>Options for career development for people analytics professionals (Source: Geetanjali Gamel)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The subject of ethics and privacy is arguably the most important part of people analytics and also its greatest challenge. This will only be exacerbated as we seek to personalise the employee experience and analyse new and emerging data sources such as wearables, biodata, email and social networks. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> presented research by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a>, which showed that a staggering 81% of people analytics projects are jeopardised by ethics and privacy concerns (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below). In recommending how to tackle this, Jonathan highlighted the need to work closely with your Chief Privacy Officer and establish a governance council and code of practice. He also emphasised the need for organisations to be open with employees and clearly articulate the benefits they can expect to receive from sharing their data. This focus on transparency and trust was also the subject of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbroderickchicago/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Broderick</a>’s presentation where she provided compelling evidence that companies with high trust cultures not only had happier and more engaged employees, but also had better business performance too. The debate of privacy vs. trust is set to be a defining one in the years ahead and it is important that people analytics leaders and practitioners get this right. If we get it wrong, we will set the discipline back – perhaps irretrievably. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5:</em></strong><em> 81% of people analytics projects are jeopardised by ethics and privacy concerns (Source: Jonathan Ferrar / Insight222)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Diversity featured highly at the Wharton People Analytics Conference also in Philadelphia earlier this year (see <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/key-takeaways-from-wharton-people-analytics-conference-david-green"" target=""_blank"">my key takeaways</a>), and the topic figured prominently at PAFOW too. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamgaker/"" target=""_blank"">Will Gaker</a> provided a hugely well-received practical playbook on how to build a diversity strategy including what data you should analyse and how to analyse it. There were many takeaways from Will’s excellent presentation, but <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> captures the two that particularly resonated with me: i) companies must analyse the whole workforce to increase diversity – not just recruiting, and ii) analytics should be used to identify gaps in order that a strategy can be created to close them. Will’s former colleague at LinkedIn, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite/"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a>, provided a detailed case study on how analytics has underpinned their DIBs (Diversity, Inclusion &amp; Belonging) program. My key takeaway from LinkedIn’s story is that these programs take time – the journey has been a four-year one and has been incremental. For example, Becca explained how cognitive diversity and a focus on teams are two initiatives that have now been incorporated into the program. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6: </em></strong><em>Organisations must analyse the whole talent management system to increase diversity (Source: Will Gaker)</em></p>, <p><em>PAFOW speakers (from L to R): Ben Hawley, Ross Sparkman and Geetanjali Gamel</em></p>, <p>The conference confirmed that people analytics has helped reinvigorate and now underpin several important disciplines within the people and HR space. Two examples are in the areas of strategic workforce planning and in organisational network analysis:</p>, <p><strong>Strategic Workforce Planning</strong>: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-sparkman-msc-mba-mhr-12710b14/"" target=""_blank"">Ross Sparkman</a> of Facebook provided a compelling case that you can’t have workforce planning without it being underpinned by people analytics. Indeed, Ross described people analytics as one of the four key components of workforce planning. The others being supply planning, demand planning and workforce strategy. Ross’ <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Workforce-Planning-Developing-Strategies/dp/074948201X"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">forthcoming book</a> ‘Strategic Workforce Planning’ certainly promises to be a must-read. I also enjoyed <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/djhouston/"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Houston</a>’s presentation where he provided an in-depth guide to how people analytics in combination with workforce planning had enabled Comcast xfinity to optimise the number and mix of full and part-time employees at their retail stores in line with customer demand and traffic.</p>, <p><em>What Workforce Planning is and isn't (Source: Ross Sparkman)</em></p>, <p><strong>Organisational Network Analysis (ONA)</strong>: For me, the growth in ONA is one of the most exciting developments in the people analytics space and one that provokes huge interest amongst practitioners (see also next two takeaways). Many examples of ONA in action were provided by speakers over the two days: Arun Chidambaram described how Pfizer is using ONA to look at areas such as innovation and leadership behaviour whilst Ben Hawley explained how Unilever had harnessed ONA to study areas such as collaboration and location strategy.</p>, <p><em>PAFOW Speakers (from L to R): Rebecca White, Chris Broderick and Guru Sethupathy</em></p>, <p>As the conference closed Al and fellow Insight222 co-founder <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkpetersen1/"" target=""_blank"">Dirk Petersen</a>, ran a live polling of delegates, which identified that ONA is the innovation in the space that attendees were most interested in. ONA was closely followed by employee sentiment and AI/Machine Learning (see <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong> below). This tallies with what I am seeing elsewhere and in my conversations with people analytics leaders around the globe. What this highlights is that the discipline is both exciting and dynamic, set to underpin the future HR function and reinforces the importance of getting the trust/privacy/ethics balance right. Finally, it also demonstrates the rising importance of people analytics. You can’t do AI in HR especially when it comes to personalising the employee experience without analytics.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7: </em></strong><em>The innovations in people analytics of most interest to PAFOW attendees (Source: Insight222)</em></p>, <p><em>PAFOW Speakers (from L to R): Will Gaker, Al Adamsen and Daniel Houston</em></p>, <p>One of the characteristics I enjoy about PAFOW is that each vendor gets to have their time in the spotlight to pitch on the business problem they are trying to solve with their product. The 15 or so vendors that showcased their products demonstrated the innovation, diversity and dynamism of the people analytics vendor space. The ones that stood out for me were: <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a>, <a href=""https://www.worklytics.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Worklytics</a>, <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TI People</a>, <a href=""http://thechemistrygroup.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Chemistry Group</a>, <a href=""https://www.visier.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Visier</a>, <a href=""https://www.virginpulse.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Virgin Pulse</a>, <a href=""https://www.glintinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glint</a> and <a href=""http://zeroedin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zeroedin</a>.</p>, <p><em>Three of the vendors showcasing their products at PAFOW (from L to R): Manish Goel of TrustSphere, Volker Jacobs of TI People and Zack Johnson of Visier</em></p>, <p>As referenced earlier, Al Adamsen announced the creation of <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> during his opening address at PAFOW. This is an exciting and much needed development in the people analytics space. As co-founder Jonathan Ferrar explains <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/insight222-elevating-people-analytics-jonathan-ferrar"" target=""_blank"">here</a> Insight222 is “<em>dedicated to the professional development of People Analytics practitioners globally and the People Analytics function as a whole.</em>” Services offered by Insight222 include:</p>, <p>You can find out more <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and I for one wish my good friends and co-founders Al, Jonathan, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs-55173316/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> and Dirk Petersen well.</p>, <p><em>Welcoming a new name to the people analytics space - Insight 222 - me with three of the co-founders (from L to R): Al Adamsen, Dirk Petersen and Jonathan Ferrar</em></p>, <p>At the start of the conference, Al Adamsen promised that the two days would provide a heady mix of education, inspiration and exploration. He was right and the reaction from the many delegates I spoke to confirmed that the thirst to learn, share and collaborate is immensely high in the people analytics space and augers well for the continued development of the discipline. The value of people analytics to the future HR function and business – and the change in mindset required for most organisations - was perhaps captured best by Ian O’Keefe in the final words of his superb presentation.</p>, <p><em>The networking is one of the features of PAFOW:</em> <em>Ross Sparkman (far left), Al Adamsen (far right) and me (2nd left) posing with Soumya Bonantaya</em></p>, <p>That seems like a perfect final takeaway.

Thankfully, the House of HR won’t have to face the Night King, his newly acquired dragon, the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead, although for those HR leaders that wait any longer to adopt analytics you never know!</p>, <p>Like the first six months of 2017, July and August saw a flood of excellent articles on people analytics and selecting the top 20 has once again proven to be a challenging task.</p>, <p>Before I start counting down the articles, I just want to highlight the superb <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; The Future of Work</a> conference, which I will be co-chairing with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> from 20-21 September in Philadelphia. There are still some tickets available, so if you want to hear from some of the best people analytics leaders on the planet such as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe/"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a> (JP Morgan Chase), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a> (McKesson), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a> (Pfizer), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-hawley-3616023/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Hawley</a> (Unilever), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite/"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a> (LinkedIn), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-sparkman-msc-mba-mhr-12710b14/"" target=""_blank"">Ross Sparkman</a> (Facebook), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a> (Capital One) and many others click on the image below to book your space.</p>, <p>On to the top 20 articles for July and August:</p>, <p>Forget Callum McGregor’s ridiculously over-hyped bout with Floyd Mayweather, the real David vs. Goliath contest this summer was hiQ Labs vs. LinkedIn/Microsoft. A brief précis: <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a> is an innovative people analytics technology provider that harnesses LinkedIn public data to help customers predict and subsequently address employee skills gaps and flight risk. As the <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/legal"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">legal page</a> on the hiQ website describes, LinkedIn sent a cease and desist notice to hiQ CEO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/weidick/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Weidick</a> in May. The very survival of the company was at stake, so hiQ decided to fight. The case, which has ramifications way beyond the world of people analytics, really caught the attention and <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/2017_0814_hiq_order.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the ruling</a> went in favour of the underdog. There have been a myriad of articles written since the judge announced he had come down on the side of hiQ – these are a selection. First, attorney <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annemitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Anne P. Mitchell</a> provides a helpful explanation of what the ruling actually means. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/briandfung/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Fung</a>’s article in the Washington Post attempts to explain the motivation of LinkedIn/Microsoft and how they have pledged to fight on. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcharney/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Charney</a> in <a href=""http://recruitingdaily.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Recruiting Daily</a> provides his unique and satirical analysis on what the implications are for the world of recruiting. Finally, you can hear Mark Weideck himself in conversation with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelcheesman/"" target=""_blank"">Joel Cheesman</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadsowash/"" target=""_blank"">Chad Sowash</a> on their podcast. I’ve got no beef with LinkedIn – it’s a great company and I’ve met some fantastic people that work there, but I’m delighted that as things stand hiQ will survive and hopefully thrive. hiQ doesn’t just provide technology to customers they also provide a forum with hiQ Elevate and the <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/podcast/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Podcast</a> to support the people analytics community. Keep up the good work Mark, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal/"" target=""_blank"">Darren Grant Kaplan</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevievegraves/"" target=""_blank"">Genevieve Graves</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/darinmedeiros/"" target=""_blank"">Darin Medeiros</a> et al.</p>, <p>This tremendous <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/quarterly/overview"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">McKinsey Quarterly</a> article implores HR to step out of its traditional silo mentality and embrace a new mindset of explicitly using talent to drive value rather than just responding passively to the routine needs of businesses. The authors set out a four-pronged strategy (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) that places people analytics and data driven HR front and centre. The article argues that “<em>companies that take these steps will move toward a next generation of HR that’s data driven, not experience driven; systematic, not ad hoc; and consistent, not hit and miss</em>.” This is a must-read for all CHROs and augers well for the continued growth and influence of analytics in HR.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: The CEO agenda for the 'New HR' (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-may-jun-2017-david-green"" target=""_blank"">Last time</a> I featured <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Power of People</a> by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a>, <a href=""https://www.jaferrar.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferra</a>r and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> and described it as the best book written to date on people analytics. In this article on <a href=""https://www.hrzone.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Zone</a>, Jonathan draws on research from the book to outline the key ingredients required to be a successful people analytics leader. The first is that the role should report to the CHRO not least as it sends a clear message that “<em>the CHRO is putting analytical decision making at the heart of the HR function</em>.” Jonathan then describes how business acumen (comprising financial literacy, political astuteness and awareness of both the internal organisation and the external marketplace) is the most important skill for people analytics leader to have. The organisations that are furthest forward with people analytics have great leaders and those that aspire to emulate these companies would do well to heed the advice Jonathan offers here. You can also hear Jonathan speak at the aforementioned People Analytics &amp; Future of Work conference in Philadelphia on 20-21 September. Find out more <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>One successful people analytics leader who possesses all of the attributes described by Jonathan is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, who leads the team at Microsoft. In this article, Dawn cleverly combines her twin passions of cooking and analytics to share some of the lessons she has learned as a people analytics leader. These include: the need to understand what is important for your business leaders, getting to the ‘why’ rather than stopping at the ‘what’ and the importance of knowing your audience when it comes to presenting insights in a way that will resonate. A perfect recipe!

In this article, Keith cites the advances in technology, digital and innovation as the fundamental cause of the increased hype, interest and adoption of people analytics. Keith then describes the opportunities these advances provide when it comes to understanding and analysing people: namely the enrichment of the digital exhaust, new people data to analyse and new ways to analyse people data. </p>, <p>In my interactions with companies and people analytics leaders, I see a lot to be optimistic about the continued growth of people analytics and data driven HR. In this article for <a href=""https://www.hrzone.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Zone</a>, I describe how people analytics is moving from the periphery to the centre of the HR agenda (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>) and cite six trends that are underpinning this transformation. This includes the need to first invest in people analytics before you can do AI in HR, new work models and emerging data sources such as wearables. Analytics is a core component of the future of HR and is absolutely critical if the function is going to provide a positive impact to the business and its employees.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: People Analytics moves from the periphery to the centre of the HR agenda - includes 'Workforce Analytics is the centrepiece of a digital agenda for HR' model by </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs-55173316/"" target=""_blank""><em>Volker Jacobs</em></a><em> | </em><a href=""http://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>TI People</em></a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> has featured in my ‘Best articles…’ series several times. Not only is she one of the leading consultants in the space, her writing is thoughtful, practical and unafraid of offering a different opinion. That is certainly the case with this article, which confronts many of the debates currently raging in the community. Should we regulate HR metrics and force companies to make this data public? Should we develop certifications for HR/People Analysts? Is it HR Analytics or People Analytics? Tracey tackles all of these questions and presents a compelling case for her positioning on all. As she rightly says, instead of wasting our time on trivial arguments, we’d be better focused on improving business and employee outcomes. Read more of Tracey’s Numerical Insights blog <a href=""https://www.numericalinsights.com/news/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>One way to help the continued growth of people analytics is the publication of case studies so that HR professionals can be inspired and learn from the successes others have had and apply these to their own organisations. What makes this example of a fast food restaurant chain so instructive is i) it demonstrates the power of people analytics on frontline staff, ii) the insights derived have led to dramatic improvements in customer satisfaction, service performance, and overall business results, and iii) the analysis busted a number of myths (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>) that had pre-existed within the organisation. Finally, the case study is in-depth, well-written and also demonstrates that one way of accelerating progress in people analytics is to partner with an external party (in this case McKinsey).</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Employee features correlating to the desired outcomes (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p>Many of the organisations I’ve studied with at least some capability in people analytics tend to have focused on just one or two areas of the employee lifecycle – typically recruitment and/or retention. In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marktlawrence/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lawrence</a> explores the opportunity to not only apply analytics across the employee lifecycle (see <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong>) but also to link the insights generated together to gain a more holistic view and have additional impact. This is an excellent article for those getting started with analytics or those seeking to expand their efforts across the employee lifecycle.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The Employee Lifecycle Teardrop (Source: Mark T Lawrence)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Tucana’s People Analytics Podcast, which is expertly hosted by Max Blumberg (and occasionally by me), certainly has a knack of attracting some terrific guests and provoking some stimulating debate. The highlights of season 2 are wittily and succinctly summarised in this article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Spence</a>.

Speaking of Tucana, I’ll be chairing their <a href=""http://paforum.tucana-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics Forum</a> in London on November 29-30 – <a href=""http://paforum.tucana-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">click here</a> to find out more.</p>, <p>With the digital revolution upon us, companies now seem to be in a state of perpetual transformation, which means that the importance of truly strategic workforce planning is paramount. As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a> write, this represents an excellent opportunity for people analytics leaders and teams to increase their impact on the business. Strategic workforce planning is not just about people now either as technology creates a dynamic reality for organisations (build, buy or bot). The advice and practical examples offered represent an indispensable guide for those seeking to understand how strategic workforce planning continues to evolve and its intrinsic link to people analytics.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> is a superb blog and resource for anyone working or interested in people analytics. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen/"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a>, one of the co-founders, has written a number of excellent articles and this recent piece tackles the subject of employee engagement. The big question Erik seeks to answer is ‘Does Engagement lead to better business performance?’ The advice and suggested methodology offered is a good guide for those seeking to demonstrate the true value of employee engagement and how people analytics can help link this to business performance.</p>, <p>Citing an infamous example from Fox News, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ridwan-ismeer-124763a5/"" target=""_blank"">Ridwan Ismeer</a> writes about the difficulties and inherent risks in building employee performance models (see example in <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below). He then describes six ways to mitigate these risks including not defining performance with a single metric, being cognisant of bias and using reverse causality. An insightful read.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Two alternative views on employee performance (Source: Ridwan Ismeer)</em></p>, <p>We hear a lot about the need to democratise data within organisations and many commentators cite it as a trend that is helping drive growth in people analytics. For the uninitiated (or indeed those trying to convince the uninitiated of the merits of data democratisation) this excellent guide by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> on what data democratisation actually is, the pros and cons and the technology that is helping to propel it is a must-read.</p>, <p>When I talk to people analytics leaders, the subject of organisational network analysis (ONA) is often referenced as an area where projects are either currently underway or being planned. Much of the data being used for ONA comes from email, but as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiparkcoll/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Arkcoll</a> writes used alone email can provide an incomplete picture. Philip illustrates this perfectly in <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong>, which shows six different network relationships from different tools in one organisation. </p>, <p><em>Figure 6 - Diagram showing some of the many networks that exist within different tools in a single organisation (Source: Philip Arkcoll)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing the ONA theme is this pair of excellent articles. First up, on the <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR blog</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardsantoslalleman/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Santos Lalleman</a>, describes how people analytics in tandem with ONA has helped researchers determine the three percent rule (see <strong>Figure 7</strong>). This infers that if you can identify the right 3% (of key influencers) you can reach 85% of other employees. This is a critical imperative for effective change management within an organisation. In the second article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> provides some fascinating insights around the burnout risks to top performers and how organisations can encourage these critical employees to disengage from their networks to recharge and refresh.   </p>, <p><em>Figure 7: The Three Per Cent Rule (Source: Richard Santos Lalleman)</em></p>, <p>The capability to translate people data and insights into compelling stories is paramount to getting stakeholder buy-in and having your recommendations implemented. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/stgmaier/"" target=""_blank"">Steffen Maier</a> provides some tips on how this can be achieved in this article on the <a href=""https://blog.hrn.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRN Blog</a>. Tips include the need to know your audience and adapting your story accordingly, the use of context and presenting actionable solutions and recommendations. Of course, HRN organises HR Tech World, the next instalment of which takes place in Amsterdam on <a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/amsterdam/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">24 and 25 October</a>. I'll be speaking in and moderating the Smart Data track. IBM and HRN have partnered on research exploring people analytics readiness and, crucially, attitudes towards new and emerging employee data sources. The results of the research will be revealed at HR Tech World. <a href=""http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/3541547/HRN-Survey"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Take the survey here</a> (or click on the image below) for a chance to win some free tickets to the show.</p>, <p><em>Click on the image above to take the survey and a chance to win some free tickets for HR Tech World in Amsterdam in October.</em></p>, <p>Recent research by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> revealed that 65% of companies surveyed are not on track to comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which comes into effect in May 2018. The legislation, which is all about privacy, has some pretty serious implications for people analytics as it changes the way organisations can collect and process data about employees and job candidates. These three articles provide more information. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/randhindi/"" target=""_blank"">Rand Hindi</a>’s article distils what the legislation actually is and the potential ramifications whilst the other three articles from SHRM, People Management and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jantegze/"" target=""_blank"">Jan Tegze</a> on Recruiting Daily focus on what HR and recruiting needs to do to get their houses in order.</p>, <p>Closely related to the GDPR and the wider importance of employee trust when it comes to people analytics is the adoption of emerging data sources such as wearables and sensors. A couple of recent articles caught my eye on this subject. First, the New York Times reports that Three Square Market, a Wisconsin tech company, has enabled employees that opt in to have a chip the size of a grain of rice injected between their thumb and index finger. Once that is done, any task involving RFID technology — swiping into the office building, paying for food in the cafeteria — can be accomplished with a wave of the hand. The second article in Bloomberg reports that Barclays has installed sensors to check when employees are at their desk. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman/"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a> ponders whether Facebook will one day extend the technology it already has so that organisations can monitor the mood of their employees. Finally, it seems opportune to once again include <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a>'s excellent article on the most important element of people analytics - employee trust, which has been resurrected on the Analytics in HR blog.</p>, <p>As I wrote <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-may-jun-2017-david-green?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_post_details%3BEgsj22r3TxGexjymZksrBg%3D%3D"" target=""_blank"">last time</a>, one of the advantages for HR in being the last major business function to adopt a data driven approach is that there is plenty to learn and be inspired by from outside the function. Three examples are provided here. First, McKinsey research provides nine insights on how business leaders are – and are not adapting – to the analytics revolution. Next, three professors from the Rotman School of Management explain that whilst the predictive capability of AI will supplant human prediction it will also complement human judgement and generate more demand for decision making. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aksweetwood/"" target=""_blank"">Adele Sweetwood</a> describes the mistake many organisations make in of conflating analytics training with data adoption. As Adele explains whilst training is critical, having an adoption plan in place is even more essential. This certainly applies when it comes to creating sustainable capability and a data driven mindset in HR and tallies with the advice offered in the McKinsey study.</p>, <p>One of the characteristics I've seen in companies that do people analytics well is that they have a CHRO who not only sponsors but is involved in people analytics. I saw Leena Nair, CHRO of Unilever, speak recently at the <a href=""http://www.beyondhrforum.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Beyond Global HR Leadership Forum</a> and was hugely impressed. During her speech, Leena emphasised that <em>“we can't say the world around us is changing, but HR will keep doing what we've always done.”</em> Her passion for staying human in a technology obsessed world is the central theme of this captivating podcast with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>. Leena believes that technology, AI and analytics can help us be more human through helping personalise HR services such as learning and recruitment (as Unilever has done) and consequently improve the work experience for employees. It is perhaps no coincidence that Unilever is one of the organisations furthest forward with people analytics (Leena references in the podcast the $100m+ saving Unilever has made as a result of predicting and preventing regretted attrition). The podcast is a great listen and exemplifies that Leena is one of a growing breed of 21st Century CHROs who combine data with intuition and experience to make decisions.

David R. Green,"August 31, 2017",6 reasons why People Analytics will be central to the future of HR,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-reasons-why-people-analytics-central-future-hr-david-green/,"[<p>The Danish physicist and Nobel Prize winner Niels Bohr once mused, “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.”</p>, <p>This is partly why I have finally given up predicting at the start of each season that Liverpool will win the Premier League, and have demurred in forecasting that 2017 will be the year that people analytics will go mainstream.</p>, <p>There are many reasons why people analytics has not yet crossed the chasm and widened its adoptees beyond visionaries to pragmatists.</p>, <p>Firstly, like pretty much any business trend, growth tends to be exponential rather than linear.</p>, <p>Secondly, and perhaps more pertinently, many professionals (in particular Chief Human Resource Leaders and HR Leaders) have still not grasped what people analytics is (clue – it’s not reporting) and the potential it offers to drive better business outcomes as well as improved employee experience and wellbeing.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, there are reasons for optimism as a number of indicators suggest exponential growth is close. As such I feel safe in writing that in the next three to five years, analytics will become a core and central discipline of HR.</p>, <p>Here are six reasons why I believe that people analytics is shifting from the periphery to the centre of the HR agenda.</p>, <p>We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution. Digital is challenging every single business model and reshaping the way we work as well as our experiences as customers and employees.</p>, <p>Regarding the opportunity digital offers to HR, CHRO of Unilever Leena Nair said in her keynote at the recent <a href=""http://www.beyondhrforum.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Beyond Global HR Leadership Forum</a> “we can't say the world around us is changing, but HR will keep doing what we've always done.”</p>, <p>This definitely applies to the need to embrace analytics; not only will the next wave of HR transformation be digital, but people analytics will be at centre of this agenda.</p>, <p>I like the model below from <a href=""http://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TI People</a>, which illustrates how developing capability in people analytics is required to deliver initiatives to i) improve and personalise the employee experience, and ii) design new organisational structures and how work gets done.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: People/Workforce Analytics is the centrepiece of a digital agenda for HR (Source: TI People)</em></p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><strong><em>David</em></strong><em> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

Well, imagine if you could organise a concert of your favourite artists of all time. No longer being on this mortal coil is not a barrier. My selection would include (but not be limited to) the likes of Bowie, The Beatles, The Clash, The Velvet Underground, New Order, Billy Idol (yes, I know - call it a guilty pleasure) and The Stones (both of the Roses and Rolling varieties).</p>, <p>This bi-monthly collection of the best people analytics articles from May and June is in HR terms at least on a similar grand scale. Some of the global giants of HR and analytics are present – Bersin, Boudreau, Cappelli, Ulrich, Briner, Davenport and Cross. People so recognised that they are known by their surnames alone.</p>, <p>The marvellous part about it is that they are all writing about people analytics and its role in helping organisations tackle some of their biggest challenges. With interest levels soaring, the number of conferences on the subject doubling in the last 12 months and adoption levels rising, all indicators seem to be pointing in the right direction. This is despite (as some of the articles included recognise) the road being bumpy and at times treacherous for organisations growing their capabilities.</p>, <p>Collectively, the 20 articles cover pretty much everything in the world of people analytics: case studies, challenges, ethics, employee experience, the future of work, diversity and inclusion etc as well as the best book yet published on the subject (see #1). There are contributions from practitioners, analysts, academics, consultants and some of the most exciting vendors in the space.</p>, <p>On the subject of exciting vendors and before we plunge into the 20 selected articles, I’d like to first highlight the ongoing legal battle between <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a> and LinkedIn (<a href=""http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202792056403/LinkedIn-Spars-With-DataMining-Company-Over-Access-to-Profiles?slreturn=20170602121056"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">see here</a> and <a href=""https://www.courthousenews.com/serious-implications-fight-harvest-linkedin-data/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), which came to my attention over the last two days. hiQ Labs, co-founded by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal/"" target=""_blank"">Darren Grant Kaplan</a>, is one of the most impressive start-ups I’ve come across in the people analytics space and up until now has been using public LinkedIn profiles to help customers i) identify critical employees that are a flight risk, and ii) map the skillset of their workforce. The judgement will be very interesting as it essentially pits privacy rights against the freedom to public information. This one is set to run and run.</p>, <p>Now without further ado, let’s get on with the 20 articles that have made the cut for this edition:</p>, <p>If you already work or are interested in the people analytics field, you must read this book. If you are a HR leader wishing to increase the impact of your people analytics function, you must read this book. If you are a business leader who expects more from HR, you must read this book. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> have written what is for me (and many others I have spoken to) the definitive book on people analytics.

The ‘Why Aren’t We There Yet?’ question inspired Dana to edit a Special Issue of the Journal of Organizational Effectiveness, People and Performance on Human Capital Analytics. I was humbled to be asked to contribute my ‘The Best Practices to Excel at People Analytics’ article – especially as the other contributors (see list of authors above) represent some of the leading thinkers in the field. All the articles by my fellow contributors warrant inclusion in this list on their own, but it is far more generous to include them all!</p>, <p>One of the most fascinating uses of people analytics is how it is being used together with Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) to uncover insights in areas such as team effectiveness, collaboration and organisational design. A captivating example is provided in the MIT Sloan Management Review, which provides details of a ten-year study led by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> (aka Mr ONA) combining academic research and business to answer the question: <em>How do we best connect employees in ways that more systematically unleash emergent innovation?</em> The findings are illuminating and in brief include highlighting the importance of Adaptive Space (see Figure 2). Other highlights include a compelling case study of the work <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> has led at GM, as well as a description of the three key roles within a network (Brokers, Central Connectors and Energisers). A terrific read with plenty to learn and be inspired by.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Adaptive Space -</em> <em>the network and organisational context that allows people, ideas, information, and resources to flow across the organisation and spur successful emergent innovation</em> - <em>Source: MIT Sloan Management Review </em> </p>, <p>One must-read study follows another. In this example, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> and the RBL Institute conducted research to assess the impact of competence in HR Analytics on three outcomes: i) personal effectiveness, ii) stakeholder value, and iii) business performance. The results weren’t those that those of us in the people analytics field would have hoped for, with the impact on business performance being fairly modest. Ulrich also notes his surprise at the findings, but offers suggestions on how to transform analytics into a sustainable and value-added HR practice. First, he confirms that analytics do matter and how used effectively can only improve decision-making. Then he recommends the need to i) focus analytics on the right business issues, ii) manage expectations by linking analytics projects to business outcomes, and iii) to build analytics on previous research. It will be fascinating to see how business impact rises as people analytics continues to mature and becomes a core component of HR.</p>, <p>One of the reasons Ulrich cites for the lower than expected impact of people analytics is the failure to focus on the right business challenges. The intrinsic link between people analytics and strategy and the ability this provides to focus on the right projects is the central theme of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a>’s terrific article. Patrick describes the four-year evolution of the people analytics function he leads at ABN AMRO. These cover evolutions in the tools and techniques used, the analytical service offered, the capabilities of the team, where the team sits within the bank (now as part of HR Strategy and Change) and how analytics has become a core component of HR’s DNA. As ever with Patrick’s articles there is plenty to learn from and to be inspired by.</p>, <p>Ethics and trust is arguably the most important part of successful people analytics and is also the biggest challenge facing the majority or practitioners I speak to. With the likes of new legislation (e.g. the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations), emerging data sources (e.g. wearables) and the rush to personalise services to employees this is a fast developing and often confusing part of analytics. These two articles from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-stanka-43260288/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Stanka</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joukovanaggelen/"" target=""_blank"">Jouko van Aggelen</a> (on the excellent <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR blog</a>) provide both the context and sound guidance required by practitioners concerned about this critical subject. I certainly concur with the advice to put employee trust and transparency to the fore.</p>, <p>Ethics was one of the six trends I identified in my recent article for the <a href=""https://blog.hrn.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRN Blog</a>, which focused on organisations that have already successfully built capability in people analytics. The other five trends focused on how organisations are i) seeking to make analytics part of the core organisational DNA, ii) embracing new and emerging data sources, iii) exploring new ways to analyse and democratise data, iv) enabling the future of work and consumerisation of HR, and v) reshaping their organisations. In summary, these organisations see analytics as a core component of HR strategy and critical to improving the impact of the function on the business. I presented these findings at the recent HR Tech World show in San Francisco (see Slideshare below and <a href=""https://blog.hrn.io/unleash-people-5-key-learnings-hr-tech-world-san-francisco/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">key learnings</a> blog). Two of my fellow presenters were...</p>, <p>If <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> earned $1 every time Bersin by Deloitte’s <a href=""http://marketing.bersin.com/rs/bersin/images/hita100113sg.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">2013 High Impact People Analytics Study</a> was quoted in a conference speech, slide or article then he would be a very rich man. The successor to this seminal study will be published later in 2017, and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a> revealed the early findings at the recent HR Tech World show in San Francisco (see Figure 3 and Slideshare below). The research indicates that companies who have built successful people analytics practices recognise the need to i) build data literacy across HR, ii) engage with the right stakeholders in the business and iii) infuse people analytics into business decisions. These findings are significant and augur well for continued and sustainable growth in the space.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: What characteristics predict organisations with high-impact people analytics functions? - The early indicators from Bersin by Deloitte's 2017 study</em></p>, <p>As a bonus, the Slideshare from Josh Bersin’s superb ‘The HR Tech Market Reinvents Itself’ presentation at HR Tech World is also provided below.</p>, <p>Next, I want to introduce you to a terrific initiative outlined in this article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs-55173316/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a>. Whilst I am confident that we will continue to see individually driven advancement in the space, it is collaboration, shared learning and co-creation by people analytics practitioners that will accelerate this process and improve both business impact and employee wellbeing. This program is different from others in that it is being led by Jonathan Ferrar and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> (together with Volker and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkpetersen1/"" target=""_blank"">Dirk Petersen</a>) - who are not only hugely respected by their peers but critically have both been people analytics leaders themselves. Volker’s article outlines the launch meetings taking place in July, which will be hosted by some of the leading lights in the world of people analytics: Patrick Coolen, Alexis Fink, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a>. I’m delighted to have been asked to join these meetings and will watch how the program, which officially launches in September, develops with interest. The space needs initiatives such as these.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Workforce Analytics is the centrepiece of a digital agenda for HR (Source - Volker Jacobs, TI People)</em></p>, <p>Unless your name is Rip van Winkle you can’t fail to have noticed that there is a lot of hype about how AI will transform HR. I believe that in the clamour to be hipper than thou many organisations are trying to put the AI cart before the analytics horse. Without first developing capability in the latter it will be difficult if not impossible to reap the benefits (to businesses and employees) of infusing AI into HR services. This is the premise of the first article in HBR by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-harrison-8b9442/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Harrison</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/deborahow/"" target=""_blank"">Deborah O’Neill</a>, which whilst not specifically focused on HR does emphasise the need for businesses to get the basics right first before plunging head first into sophisticated AI (this definitely applies to HR). Not content with releasing (together with Jonathan Ferrar) the definitive book on people analytics (see #1), Nigel Guenole and Sheri Feinzig (together this time with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrislamb/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Lamb</a>) offer some practical advice on a key building block for AI in HR – the need to audit your organisation’s competency frameworks. The white paper outlines the taxonomies that competencies are comprised (see <em>Figure 5</em> below), why CHROs should either develop and/or audit their existing frameworks, the uses of competencies in AI infused recruitment, career development and learning, and the role of competencies in the future of HR.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: KSAO - The taxonomies that competencies are comprised (Source: IBM Smarter Workforce Institute)</em></p>, <p>In the last round-up of articles from March and April, I featured <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-hr-three-steps-getting-started-keith-mcnulty"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-hr-ins-outs-keith-mcnulty"" target=""_blank"">Part 2</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-hr-intelligent-modelling-keith-mcnulty"" target=""_blank"">Part 3</a> of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty-94040a/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a>’s superb series on machine learning in HR. If you haven’t already, I recommend reading the articles in sequential order. Once you have you’ll be set up nicely for the fourth and final part, To conclude the series, Keith advises first on how to decide if the output of your algorithm is good enough to do something with. Then Keith looks at how to implement it effectively as a predictive tool to support (not replace) human judgement, ensuring that the right processes and procedures are put in place to ensure that potentially damaging aspects of the model are appropriately managed.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> has rapidly become a reliable source of high-quality articles on people analytics and organisational network analysis. In this example, Greg describes how analysing email meta data can help shine a light on a huge problem for many businesses – employee burnout. This is a major contributory cause of attrition and impacts on efforts to build an engaged workforce. As Newman describes, many of the variables required to analyse burnout are visible in our email activity – see four of these in <em>Figure 6</em> below – and as email detail is constantly changing organisations can take the steps necessary to mitigate burnout. Newman’s company <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> are definitely onto something here as this insight would be invaluable for pretty much every company I know.</p>, <p><em>Figure 6: Four variables of employee burnout that can analysed from email meta data (Greg Newman)</em></p>, <p>The vast majority of HR leaders recognise how analytics can support better decision-making, but as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman/"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a> describes in this helpful article on the <a href=""https://www.visier.com/workforce-intelligence-blog/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Visier blog</a>, many are unsure how to do so. Creelman then reels off three mistakes to avoid: i) rebranding the HR Reporting Team by adding the word ‘Analytics’ without providing additional resources, ii) hiring data scientists and asking them to search for insights in the data instead of focusing on the critical business issues, and; iii) overlooking the rest of HR and not taking the steps to improve their data fluency and therefore raise the overall analytical capability within HR. Creelman then provides some good tips on how to avoid falling into these traps.</p>, <p>I always enjoy spending time with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupertmorrison/"" target=""_blank"">Rupert Morrison</a> and his super smart team at <a href=""https://www.orgvue.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">OrgVue</a>. Like me they advocate that people analytics isn’t about providing insights that help HR – instead it should be about improving the organisation. In this terrific article, Rupert offers five mindsets HR should adopt to win hearts and minds within the business. Two suggestions I’d particularly like to highlight are first the need for HR to couple analytics with organisational design to answer the question “how good is my workforce in executing the business strategy?” Secondly, Morrison’s suggestion to gamify and crowdsource the data collection and cleaning process is also quite brilliant. A must-read.</p>, <p>If people analytics is to become a core component of the future HR profession then it is vital that the professional bodies support and enable their members. The CIPD under <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/petercheese/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cheese</a> has taken a lot of steps in this direction and the work of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Edward Houghton</a> has done much to steer things forward. This article presents some of the fruits of his labour: three reports that designed to help practitioners continue to advance and innovate in the field.

Developing a thoughtful approach to how continuous listening and the data it generates can be translated into relevant insights and actions towards improving the employee experience should be a priority. Laura’s article provides five tips on how to achieve this. The one I’d like to highlight is the fifth on ensuring that you apply advanced analytics to the data you collect. This highlights the pivotal role analytics is playing in the evolution of employee engagement – I know of many people analytics functions who have now taken on additional responsibility for survey management, employee listening and expect this trend to continue. </p>, <p>This HBR article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-cappelli-14936a3/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cappelli</a> has provoked some heated debate. The majority seem to have sided with the distinguished professor and concur that HR does not actually have big data. Certainly, few would disagree with Cappelli’s assertion that the challenge for most HR functions is simply to use data at all. However, some would argue that analysing email data, employee sentiment, data from wearable devices and external talent supply and demand data as some organisations are beginning to do does deserve the ‘big’ descriptor. In many respects though this article is one where you need to look past the headline as much of the advice Cappelli offers is both relevant and salient.</p>, <p>Any article that starts with a sports analogy is guaranteed to lure me in and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ridwan-ismeer-124763a5/"" target=""_blank"">Ridwan Ismeer</a>’s recollection of Real Madrid’s ill-fated 2003-04 season was no exception. Even better it’s packed with great insights on people analytics. First, Ridwan provides a pretty sound analysis on the common characteristics of successful people analytics programs. Then he summarises the typical employee attributes used to build models and herein lies the ‘missing’ element in the article’s title. Pretty much all of this data can be classed as human capital data stored in HR systems, but as Ridwan argues what about social capital and the relationship and network data that this is comprised of? He then provides a compelling example from a survey he conducted in an organisation himself – see <em>Figure 7</em> below.</p>, <p><em>Figure 7: Examples of relationship analytics (Ridwan Ismeer)</em></p>, <p>One of the few (only?) advantages of being the last major function in the business to embrace analytics and a evidence-based culture is that there is plenty to learn from and be inspired by from outside HR. Three examples are provided here. First, research from McKinsey focuses on the current and next wave opportunities in digitisation, analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation, their potential impact on employment and work plus advice on what leaders should do. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddclarklek/"" target=""_blank"">Todd Clark</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielwiesenfeld/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Wiesenfeld</a> describe three things holding back analytics in business: structure, culture and methodology (sound familiar?).

This quintet of articles provides some contrasting views. The first article centres on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxine-williams-7697485/"" target=""_blank"">Maxine Williams</a>’ (Facebook’s Global Director of Diversity) speech at the recent <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/key-takeaways-from-wharton-people-analytics-conference-david-green"" target=""_blank"">Wharton People Analytics Conference</a>, where she challenged the people analysts present that they needed to do more particularly in the area of race under-representation. The second article (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-briner-8ab7807/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Briner</a> et al) describes how using evidence (and data) can help HR drive change with regards to D&amp;I within their organisations. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyonschu/"" target=""_blank"">Hyon S Chu</a> describes the main findings of a joint study by <a href=""https://www.cultureamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Culture Amp</a> and <a href=""https://www.paradigmiq.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paradigm</a> (CEO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelle-emerson-4a24225/"" target=""_blank"">Joelle Emerson</a> also features in the Wharton article too) on D&amp;I specifically in the technology industry. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/frida-polli-03a1855/"" target=""_blank"">Frida Polli</a> of <a href=""https://www.pymetrics.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pymetrics</a> argues that whilst it is impossible to remove bias from humans, it is possible to remove it from algorithms through training, engineering and testing. Al as a powerful force for good – that seemed a good point to conclude the countdown for this time until the Wall Street Journal article appeared on Unilever, one of Pymetrics’ customers, and how they have ditched resumes and traditional campus recruiting in favour of algorithms for some early-career roles.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If you prefer listening rather than reading about people analytics, then I strongly recommend you check out the <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/category/podcast/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tucana People Analytics Podcast</a>, which is usually hosted by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>.

Will this be the year when it becomes absorbed into the wider fabric of HR? Maybe. Maybe not.</p>, <p>Whether it does or whether it doesn’t, one thing is for sure interest levels in data driven people decisions has never been higher. The recent people analytics conferences hosted by Wharton and Tucana in Philadelphia and London respectively were attended by in total close to 1,000 people. The number of articles published on the subject continues to rise and the diversity of subjects describing the challenges people analytics is helping to tackle is stark.</p>, <p>This makes collating the best articles both more enriching and increasingly challenging, but after much deliberation spent listening to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista!"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sandinista!</a> - The Clash's monumental 36 track triple album - here are the 20 articles that stood out in March and April:</p>, <p>Let’s open with one of the most important articles written yet on the subject of people analytics. In many respects the practice of people analytics is going in the right direction – interest levels have soared, adoption is rising and significant sums are being invested in the space by large consultancies, tech giants and start-ups alike. However, as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marktlawrence/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lawrence</a> so passionately argue, continued growth of people analytics is under threat. They cite a potent mix of ill-conceived products, consultants that promise the earth but fail to deliver, uneducated opportunists chasing filthy lucre and naïve consumers who are too easily satisfied by a funky dashboard. Max and Mark’s call for a professional body to outline competencies, define training, provide certification and perhaps most importantly a code of ethics is long overdue. Let’s see if anyone is willing to take up the challenge… </p>, <p>One of the criticisms that can be levied at the majority of people analytics articles is that they are too short and therefore only scratch at the surface of the issue they are attempting to tackle. This certainly doesn't apply to this phenomenally superb series by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty-94040a/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a>, who leads McKinsey’s internal people analytics and assessment capability globally. Throughout the course of three excellently crafted articles (Part 4 - the final episode will follow soon) Keith demystifies machine learning and predictive analytics in HR. In broad terms, Part 1 focuses on preparing your organisation, Part 2 looks at structuring the problem you are trying to solve (""<strong><em>what</em> </strong><em>do you want to model and</em><strong><em> why </em></strong><em>do you want to model it</em>"") whilst Part 3 examines how to prep the data and choose the right algorithm. Do read the articles in sequential order, as there is much to absorb and learn. It is an invaluable contribution to the practice of people analytics. Thank you Keith, I’ll add Part 4 once you publish it!</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a> has already trod the path I predict many heads of people analytics will follow – all the way to the CHRO role as the practice of HR finally becomes more evidence based. This two-part article in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsumser/"" target=""_blank"">John Sumser</a>’s excellent <a href=""http://www.hrexaminer.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Examiner</a> provides the perfect roadmap for success. Part 1 outlines 10 of the key steps (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below) Mark followed, whilst Part 2 looks at each of these steps in more detail. Mark’s passion, knowledge and humour shines throughout what is both a hugely enjoyable and insightful read. See also <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-2-mark-berry-david-green"" target=""_blank"">my interview with Mark Berry</a> for more on his fascinating insights on people analytics, the role of the CHRO and the future of HR.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: 10 steps to evidence based HR - Mark Berry</em></p>, <p>This HBR article presents the findings of a fascinating four-year study by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebrebele/"" target=""_blank"">Reb Rebele</a> and is an example of the magnitude of impact ambitious people analytics projects can have on both individuals and organisations (as well as being a project that really resonated with me personally). The study examines perhaps the most important people in any organisation – the ‘givers’, how uncontrolled their generosity puts them at risk of burnout and outlines the steps they can adopt so that they don’t wear themselves out. The advice offered (see also <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below) broadly falls into three areas: i) be more proactive and less reactive about how you help, ii) focus on lower cost and higher impact ways of helping, and iii) be more selective rather than helping everyone with everything. For more on this subject, read Grant and Rebele’s follow-up article – <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/02/more-on-being-generous-without-being-a-doormat"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">More on Being Generous Without Being a Doormat</a> and watch this <a href=""https://hbr.org/video/5270475111001/how-and-when-selflessness-at-work-backfires"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">video</a>.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Where are you on the generosity spectrum and 7 habits of highly productive giving - Adam Grant and Reb Rebele</em></p>, <p>This is a first. Previously, I've baulked at including any of my own articles in these ‘best of’ retrospectives, but this entry isn’t about me. It’s about the inspirations, key discussions and stunning work exhibited at two of the holy trinity of conferences dedicated to people analytics – Wharton’s People Analytics Conference and Tucana’s <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> (the other is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a>’s <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; The Future of Work</a>). My summation from the Wharton conference features insights from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieran-snyder-60572987/"" target=""_blank"">Kieran Snyder</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cade-massey-8036282/"" target=""_blank"">Cade Massey</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindav4/"" target=""_blank"">Linda van Leeuwen</a>, whilst my round-up of the Tucana conference (which I also had the good fortune to chair) features the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers/"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a>. It is conferences such as these that help move the practice forward.</p>, <p><em>Click on the image above to read the key takeaways from April's People Analytics World Conference in London</em></p>, <p>Two more articles inspired by the <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> conference. Firstly, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathrynnewbery/"" target=""_blank"">Cathryn Newbery</a> provides an impeccable summary of the keynotes by Alec Levenson and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhowes/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Howes</a>, which together outlined seven areas where the people analytics profession needs to do better. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcarty/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Carty</a>’s equally excellent article also refers to the Levenson and Howes keynotes but touches too on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colenussbaumer/"" target=""_blank"">Cole Nussbaumer</a>’s masterclass in storytelling with data before focusing in depth on fascinating insights from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-sparkman-msc-mba-mhr-12710b14/"" target=""_blank"">Ross Sparkman</a> in how Facebook uses analytics to support workforce planning, hiring and succession planning.</p>, <p><em>(L-R) Peter Howes, Ross Sparkman and Alec Levenson speaking at People Analytics World</em></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> also features in my next entry together with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a>, who heads up Talent Intelligence and Analytics at Intel. Two of the sharpest minds in our space surmise (correctly, in my view) that most companies are still struggling to get business insights from their HR data, and also cannot yet focus on advanced analytics and prediction. All is not lost though as they then provide some practical steps to follow, which can be boiled down to choosing the right analysts (combining business acumen with an understanding of people) and then deploying them to work most effectively with both the business and HR. The advice provided on asking the right questions (as opposed to starting with the data) particularly resonates. A must-read.</p>, <p>This report examines the state of analytics across the enterprise but there is much for those involved with people analytics to learn. The first is that we are not alone when it comes to struggling to execute a strategy for what we want to achieve with analytics. A second is that whilst analytics is now a mainstream idea it is still not a mainstream practice - this is particularly true of course for people analytics. The report presents five key findings: i) Competitive advantage with analytics is waning, ii) Optimism about the potential of analytics remains strong, iii) Achieving competitive advantage with analytics requires resolve and a sustained commitment to changing the role of data in decision making, iv) Companies that are successful with analytics are much more likely to have a strategic plan for analytics, and this plan is usually aligned with the organization’s overall corporate strategy, and; v) Most companies are not prepared for the robust investment and cultural change that are required to achieve sustained success with analytics. This report is a must-read.</p>, <p>The premise of this excellent article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> is that, in the information age, people data is rapidly becoming the most valuable source of data in the business. Marr cites the spike in companies investing in technology that can measure and analyse the behaviour and performance of their employees. One example is Deloitte with their <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-capital/topics/improve-employee-experience-management-connectme.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">ConnectMe</a> HR analytics platform, which is focused firmly on the needs of employees. Marr’s discussion with Deloitte principal <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gretczko/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Gretczko</a> about the platform is revealing, and we can expect to a see a flood of companies adopting similar platforms that are “<em>tailored specifically for employees</em>” (we have <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/watson/talent/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">similar platforms at IBM</a>), which like ConnectMe “<em>bring personalised content and experiences based on what employees need</em>”. I concur with Marr’s quote below and believe that it distils the central theme for people analytics moving forward perfectly. For more insight from Bernard Marr, check out <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/2017/04/07/bernard-marr-strategic-enterprise-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this episode of the Tucana People Analytics Podcast</a>, where he speaks to Max Blumberg.</p>, <p><em>Click on the image above to listen to Bernard Marr on the Tucana People Analytics Podcast</em></p>, <p>Initially I was going to select just one or maybe two of these articles, but given they all fall under the category of 'practitioner guidance and/or case studies', I thought readers would want to have easy access to all four. First up is another great <a href=""http://hros.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Open Source</a> case study (do check out what <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsschmidt/"" target=""_blank"">Lars Schmidt</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambrosiavertesi/"" target=""_blank"">Ambrosia Vertesi</a> have created with #HROS if you haven’t already), this time from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmbrown1/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Brown</a> describing Soundcloud’s people analytics journey. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasherahmadi/"" target=""_blank"">Hasher Ahmadi</a>, who is building KLM’s people analytics capability, provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement analytics on the <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics In HR</a> blog. Next <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keenansteiner/"" target=""_blank"">Keenan Steiner</a> describes the superb use case of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyushmathur/"" target=""_blank"">Piyush Mathur</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougshagam/"" target=""_blank"">Doug Shagam</a> on how they quantified the cost of a single percentage point of attrition to mobilise stakeholders around a strategy to promote lateral moves at Nielsen. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrfredrik/"" target=""_blank"">Fredrik Johnsson</a> of Spotify outlines how using the right data at the right time is absolutely pivotal to making the right hiring decisions.</p>, <p><em>The deck from Nielsen's presentation at Talent Connect upon which the article referenced above is based - Piyush Mathur and Doug Shagam</em></p>, <p>There are more great practitioner stories in my next entry too. The video panel features <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a>, who heads up Talent Analytics globally at Chevron, and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamgaker/"" target=""_blank"">Will Gaker</a> of LinkedIn’s Talent Analytics team in discussion with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patwadors/"" target=""_blank"">Pat Wadors</a> (LinkedIn CHRO) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanbrowne/"" target=""_blank"">Brendan Browne</a> (Global Head of Talent Acquisition, LinkedIn). RJ and Will describe the importance of talent analytics in their companies, whilst the accompanying blog outlines three examples – one each from Chevron and LinkedIn and also an example featuring <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/boryanadineva/"" target=""_blank"">Boryana Dineva</a> on how Tesla used analytics to gain invaluable (and counterintuitive) insights into its employee referral program.</p>, <p><em>WATCH: Will Gaker (left) and RJ Milnor discuss how data and analytics has helped shape the talent strategies at LinkedIn and Chevron</em></p>, <p>A regular inclusion in these ‘best of’ retrospectives, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68/"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> provides a regular supply of great content to organisations and practitioners looking to get started with people analytics or those seeking to build on their initial foundations. This article focuses on Sam’s view (based on his experience and research) that organisations that have invested in a Centre of Expertise have invariably been those that have had more success in building a more credible, agile and sustainable People Analytics proposition. Sam then outlines some of the building blocks involved including: appointing the right leader, determining an appropriate agenda/vision, assembling the right skill-sets (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below) and agreeing success criteria with the business. A hugely insightful read once again from Sam.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Skills required in a People Analytics CoE - Sam Hill</em></p>, <p><em>The next three articles focus on the evolution of employee engagement and its increasing underpinning by analytics...</em></p>, <p>One of the emerging topics in people analytics and potentially one of its most important benefits is how it can underpin efforts to understand, improve and personalise the employee experience. This superb article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a> of <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a> outlines first why investment in people analytics is a pre-requisite and then describes three ways analytics can boost programs in this area: i) segmentation, ii) targeting and prioritising investment as well as iii) understanding and demonstrating value.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>’s new book <a href=""http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111932162X.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘The Employee Experience Advantage’</a> comes highly recommended as this teaser in the Harvard Business Review demonstrates. In the article, Jacob compares organisations that have invested long-term in ‘experience’ to those that have invested short-term in ‘engagement’. The results Jacob presents are highly interesting – both in terms of business metrics but also stock market performance (as illustrated in <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> below). Given that people analytics is crucial to understanding and improving the experience in the three environments outlined by Jacob as most important to employees (cultural, technological and physical), these are highly compelling findings.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Companies that invest in Employee Experience outperform those that don't - Jacob Morgan (The Employee Experience Advantage, Wiley 2017)</em></p>, <p>The third and final entry in this edition on the subject of the evolution of employee engagement and its increasing underpinning by analytics comes from another excellent piece on the Analytics In HR blog. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/senguptaraja/"" target=""_blank"">Raja Sengupta</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumyasanto/"" target=""_blank"">Soumyasanto Sen</a> provide a detailed walk through the hotly debated topic of engagement, demonstrate some of the new thinking in this area (from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>) and suggest a model (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below) on how you can deploy engagement analytics over time.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Deploying Engagement Analytics over a period of time. From proof of concept till establishing analytics in an organisation or culture - Raja Sengupta &amp; Soumyasanto Sen</em></p>, <p>Storytelling is often cited as one of the capabilities many people analytics teams struggle with. Without a compelling story and effective communication you will not be able to turn your hard earned insights into actions. This excellent article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjcook/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Cook</a> distils storytelling with data into four simple and easy to follow steps addressing the plot (what questions are you addressing), the context, understanding your audience and summarising.</p>, <p>Proficiency in storytelling aside, three other perhaps more foundational challenges are often cited by organisations struggling to build capability in people analytics: criticality (where to focus), capability (where to develop the skills of the team) and credibility (how to increase influence and impact). These three areas and the ways to mitigate them are described on the excellent <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside HR blog</a> by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronmcewan/"" target=""_blank"">Aaron McEwan</a> of CEB. This is an invaluable read for those starting out or those struggling to make an impact with people analytics.</p>, <p><em>Finally, I look at three emerging topics in people analytics and highlight the best recent articles on each topic. First up is the re-emergence of Organisational Network Analysis then tackling bias and we ending with ethics, privacy and trust.</em></p>, <p>As adoption of people analytics continues we have also seen in parallel a revitalisation in the interest of Organisational Network Analysis (ONA). Four examples are included here. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> of the pioneering <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> examines how combining ONA with people analytics supports the identification and retention of HiPOs. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Spence</a> looks at how ONA can be used to understand and enhance team dynamics and collaboration. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/saskiamenke/"" target=""_blank"">Saskia Menke</a> takes a broader view on the uses of ONA for people analytics (inc. in M&amp;A) before finally, <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work by Google</a> recounts a specific example from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> of <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a> on the effect networks and day to day employee interactions had on performance across a European bank’s branch network.</p>, <p>Does analytics reduce or magnify unconscious bias? This is another contentious area that is regularly debated at conferences and in the press. This trio of articles highlight with the right science and approach, analytics can significantly mitigate the dangers of unconscious bias. Firstly, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomredman/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas C. Redman</a> offers some great advice on rooting out bias from your decision-making. Then two articles from the FT focus on the specific topic of diversity recruitment and what companies such as KPMG, Vodafone and Microsoft are doing to remove gender bias from the recruitment process. Look out for some telling advice from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/theresamchenry/"" target=""_blank"">Theresa McHenry</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinblackburn/"" target=""_blank"">Martin Blackburn</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/schveninger/"" target=""_blank"">Catalina Schveninger</a> in the first article, and also how Catalina has employed technologies such as <a href=""https://textio.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Textio</a> and <a href=""http://www.headstartapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Headstart</a> at Vodafone to support this initiative. Textio also features in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jane-wild-7898389/"" target=""_blank"">Jane Wild</a>’s piece, which looks at the fascinating subject of how language and imagery can detract or entice female jobseekers – <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieran-snyder-60572987/"" target=""_blank"">Kieran Snyder</a>, CEO of Textio, and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelle-emerson-4a24225/"" target=""_blank"">Joelle Emerson</a> of <a href=""http://www.paradigmiq.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paradigm</a> both feature here. </p>, <p>Finally, we end with the subject that is provoking more debate than anything else when I speak to practitioners and attend conferences: ethics, privacy and employee trust – much of it fuelled by the increasing number of companies looking to gain insights from employee data collected from wearable devices. I’ve included a selection of articles here: Jane Wild’s article in the FT describes some of the quandaries employers are facing and features views and advice from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-collins-8103b02/"" target=""_blank"">Laurence Collins</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Edward Houghton</a> of the CIPD and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-bruce-b84578/"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Bruce</a>. The article also references the EU’s pending GDPR, which is the subject of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghavsingh/"" target=""_blank"">Raghav Singh</a>’s piece. Then there is a well-balanced Newsnight report (see video below) on the growth of wearables, which includes comments from Ben Waber of Humanyze. Next up, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahbutcherjournalist/"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Butcher</a>’s article looks specifically at the use of people analytics in the financial services sector – look out for some sage observations from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> here. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/beneubanks/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Eubanks</a> offers some sound advice to organisations (with some additional comments from yours truly) on the importance of putting employee trust front and centre when it comes to using their data. This debate will only intensify, which seems a nice place to finish this round-up of the best articles!  </p>, <p><em>WATCH: BBC Newsnight report on the growth of wearables in the workplace and the implications for employee trust and privacy</em></p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><strong><em>David</em></strong><em> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

David R. Green,"May 3, 2017",Key takeaways from People Analytics World,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/key-takeways-from-people-analytics-world-david-green/,"[<p>For the third consecutive year, I had the honour of chairing Tucana’s <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> Conference (#PAWorld17) in London on 25-26 April, which has firmly established itself as the premier gathering of the people analytics community in Europe.</p>, <p>Whilst the conference demonstrated that interest levels and adoption of people analytics continue to go in the right direction, the practice needs to overcome a number of obstacles before it can be said to have truly arrived. Like Anthony Joshua, who triumphed in the other big event to take place in London last week, people analytics can certainly pack a punch. Nevertheless, it is also susceptible to a counterpunch from a more experienced (and in the case of many HR leaders, a highly sceptical) opponent.</p>, <p>Here are my key takeaways from an enjoyable and thought provoking two days, which are split as follows. First, takeaways #1 to #5 provide a critical view of the current state of people analytics, takeaways #6 to #9 describe some of the best practices exhibited at the conference, #10 to #13 look at the opportunities afforded by the future and the consequent focus on ethics whilst #14 to #16 wrap-up proceedings. Enjoy and do please let me know in the comments your thoughts.</p>, <p>Despite the steady growth in interest, adoption and sophistication of the case studies on show, the practice of people analytics continues to be a work in progress. The number of organisations who have used people analytics to move the dial on business performance and employee wellbeing is still too small. Many more are stuck in an endless cycle of reporting and are too focused on the data to see the bigger picture within their organisations. Whilst the talent, enthusiasm and camaraderie of the delegates at #PAWorld17 was inspiring, it is not enough. People analytics now needs to move beyond this growing, highly capable but still relatively small group to the wider HR community. Developments in technology, the need to embrace digital and a thirst to develop consumer like experiences for employees are all helping to propel people analytics forward. The time to push even harder towards widespread adoption is now. I concur with Josh Bersin that <em>“Analytics is no longer a ‘good idea’ for HR – it is now mandatory,”</em> but that there is still a tremendous amount of work to do before this vision is realised.</p>, <p><em>Alec Levenson (left) and Peter Howes both delivered a much-needed wake-up call in their People Analytics World keynotes (Photos by Andreas Grieger)</em></p>, <p>“<em>I see a great deal of potential for HR analytics, and I’m very, very afrai</em>” said <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> as he began his provocative opening keynote at #PAWorld17. Levenson struck a chord with many gnarled people analysts in the audience when he added that we are “<em>not focusing enough on the questions that matter and too much on the data in front of us</em>.” This is perhaps the key challenge that is holding the practice back, and one that we revisit time and time again at every people analytics conference I attend. So what should we do differently? Perhaps, as Levenson suggested, instead of concentrating our solutions at the individual level we need to turn the traditional approach of people analytics on its head and start with the business results to be achieved (see Levenson’s model in <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below). I can certainly see that this approach will help people analysts to focus on the questions that really matter to the business, eschewing work Levenson describes as “<em>keeping the lights on</em>” and instead help the business “<em>move the needle strategically</em>”. For more on Levenson’s keynote, please see <a href=""http://www2.cipd.co.uk/pm/peoplemanagement/b/weblog/archive/2017/04/26/seven-things-we-re-doing-wrong-with-hr-analytics.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this superb write-up</a> by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathrynnewbery/"" target=""_blank"">Cathryn Newbery</a>, and also Levenson’s superb book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Analytics-Advancing-Organizational-Effectiveness/dp/1626560552/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435616943&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=alec+levenson"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Strategic Analytics</a>, which explores this concept in much more depth.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: Start with the business results to be achieved - Alec Levenson</em></p>, <p>When I speak to many people analytics practitioners especially those just starting out or at the intermediate level of maturity, the Holy Grail they seek is return on investment. But are we aiming too low? Levenson thinks so surmising that restricting yourself to ROI immediately puts you on the back foot – especially with our traditional foes in finance. As Levenson explained, using <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below, ROI only offers a short-term financial return. Far better to focus on investments that improve competitive advantage and consequently provide long-term financial return. Ultimately, this approach will enhance the practice of people analytics in the long-term and help turn the dial on the reputation of HR at the leadership level and throughout the business.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: ROI vs. Competitive Advantage - Alec Levenson</em></p>, <p>Like Levenson, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhowes/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Howes</a> is one of the foremost respected brains globally on people analytics and also like Levenson, Howes’ keynote provided another much-needed wake-up call to the #PAWorld17 audience. Howes was in fine form as he expressed doubts that even 5% of organisations were really doing analytics (instead confusing 'analytics' with reporting and creating dashboards) with their people data. This means as Howes described that “<em>we are just publishing stuff; this is important from a hygiene perspective, but it doesn’t add value and it doesn’t demonstrate credibility</em>.” Howes believes much of the problem can be attributed to the plethora of maturity models published by consultants. These preach the need to develop incrementally through the various stages of reporting before tackling predictive analytics. Howes argues (and I agree) that neither the skills mix of the team nor the expectations of stakeholders grows incrementally. Certainly, people analytics leaders such as Patrick Coolen of ABN AMRO have had success in developing reporting and analytics in parallel. Up until now, people like Patrick have been the exception rather than the norm. It will be interesting to see if this continues to be the case moving forward as the urgency for organisations to develop capability in people analytics intensifies. <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below summarises Howes’ sage advice on what analytics CoEs typically currently do versus what they should be doing. </p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Skills typically present and missing from Workforce Analytics CoEs - Peter Howes</em></p>, <p>Storytelling is a capability that is often overlooked when companies are building their people analytics teams. This is a mistake as without a compelling story and effective communication, stakeholders are unlikely to action the insights you have toiled so hard to uncover. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colenussbaumer/"" target=""_blank"">Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic</a>’s book ‘<a href=""http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Storytelling with Data</a>’ is a must-read for anyone who works with and presents data and her keynote at #PAWorld17 was probably the most universally well-received presentation of the whole conference. To pick just one nugget out, Nussbaumer’s suggestion that your story should follow a narrative arc as opposed to the traditional linear method really resonated (see <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> below).</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Typical stories follow a linear path, but stories should have shape - Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><em>Whilst people analytics can certainly not afford to rest on its laurels, there was much at #PAWorld17 to inspire confidence for a brighter future. Takeaways #6 to #9 explore some of these:</em></p>, <p>It may sound like a cliché, but people analytics really is a journey. For most companies this means 3 to 5 years. Stories of overnight success are rare and there will be bumps along the way. Organisations that stay the course, learn equally from their successes and failures, maintain their focus on the challenges facing the business, and partner with colleagues outside HR and even the company are the ones that are typically successful. This is certainly true for the likes of ABN AMRO and Cisco, where each time I’ve seen <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> speak their organisations have moved further along the road. Similarly, the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edenbritt/"" target=""_blank"">Eden Britt</a> (HSBC), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232/"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a> (Experian), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-kildare-3685741/"" target=""_blank"">Gary Kildare</a> (IBM) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/blair-hopkins-531429a/"" target=""_blank"">Blair Hopkins</a> (EY) all demonstrated how their organisations had grown their people analytics capability over the course of a number of years. Perhaps the best example I saw in the Strategy track at the conference came from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brydie-lear-4462a12/"" target=""_blank"">Brydie Lear</a>, Global Head HR Intelligence &amp; Analytics at ING. The journey (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below) started in 2013 and has comprised three chapters to date. Chapter 1 saw eight successful pilots, which gave the momentum for further investment in talent and tools in Chapter 2. Challenges faced included the length of time required for modelling and advanced analytics, the lack of analytical skills among HRBPs and the infrastructure that was holding the team back. Fortunately, the combination of a fully supportive CHRO (to whom Lear now reports to) and a new bank-wide strategy that placed data and analytics at its heart helped to ING overcome these obstacles and Chapter 3 now sees people analytics as a strategic priority.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5 - Highlights of the People Analytics journey at ING - Brydie Lear</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the ingredients I’ve witnessed in organisations that have successfully built people analytics capability is that they have a brilliant and inspirational leader. This was once again eminently visible amongst speakers and delegates at #PAWorld17. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-constitutes-best-practice-people-analytics-david-green"" target=""_blank"">As I’ve written previously</a>, the Head of People Analytics role is multi-faceted. You need to have business acumen, be able to develop a winning strategy, build organisational capability, manage stakeholders across the business and have the political astuteness required to drive actionable insights into business outcomes. The complexity of the role was highlighted superbly by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a>, Global Head of Talent Analytics at Pfizer, in <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below, during his and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bennetvoorhees/"" target=""_blank"">Bennet Voorhees</a>’ presentation.   </p>, <p><em>Figure 6: The intra- and inter- company responsibilities of the Head of People Analytics - Arun Chidambaram</em></p>, <p>Building people analytics capability is a significant undertaking, but sustaining it is even more challenging. For most organisations this means enabling and supporting HRBPs and building an analytical culture within HR. Several speakers touched on this, notably <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjoerdvandenheuvel/"" target=""_blank"">Sjoerd van den Heuvel</a> whose session on the culture and partnerships that make people analytics sustainable was well received. Other speakers such as Brydie Lear, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mari%C3%ABlle-sonnenberg-phd-ab722a3/"" target=""_blank"">Mariëlle Sonnenberg</a> and Patrick Coolen also highlighted this critical component. Arun Chidambaram’s advice on how his team continue to work with HRBPs and the business to implement the insights derived from their projects particularly resonated. Without partnerships like this your people analytics efforts risk being unsustainable, lacking impact and are ultimately at risk of being cut when the budget monster rears its ugly head.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The conference provided several examples of innovative uses of ‘emerging’ or non-traditional data. Perhaps the most innovative came from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/randyknaflic/"" target=""_blank"">Randy Knaflic</a>, VP HR &amp; Internal Operations at Jawbone during his well-received keynote aptly entitled ‘Crazy, Scary People Data.’ Knaflic spoke about how Jawbone is combining wearable data (e.g. sleep and heart rate) with HR data to derive new insights such as how sleep patterns are affected in the run-up to a new product launch. This was a fascinating peak into a potential future for people analytics and whilst Knaflic stressed that use of this data was opt-in (over 90% at Jawbone), anonymised and aggregated the debate it prompted suggested this one will run and run. Other examples of innovative data uses came from:</p>, <p><em>Figure 7: Philips' project to understand the people factors that best contribute to business performance - Franc Damhuis</em></p>, <p><em>As we look to the future, there is also much to be optimistic about when it comes to the continued growth and eventual widespread adoption of people analytics.</em></p>, <p>It is doubtful whether any industry commentator has their finger on the pulse of what the future of technology, data and analytics can offer more than <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a>. In an inspirational speech, Bernard described how the leading organisations are building enterprise analytics team that capitalise on new technology, tools and techniques. He also outlined the four key pillars of how companies derive value from their data (see <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong> below) – and the lessons HR can learn from this. Being the last business function to adopt analytics may at times be embarrassing for HR, but at least it means we have plenty of places and talent elsewhere in the business from where we can draw inspiration from!</p>, <p><em>Figure 8: The four pillar model of how companies are deriving value from data - Bernard Marr</em></p>, <p>Organisations that have already invested in getting their people data in order and harnessing analytics are the ones best placed to capitalise on the opportunities and requirements of the future of work. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-collins-8103b02/"" target=""_blank"">Laurence Collins</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers/"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> of Deloitte ably demonstrated how some of these organisations have already introduced automation and AI into their HR services, whilst offering a path for others to develop their capability. Two organisations that have already started to see the benefits of their investments in this area are IBM and Cisco. Gary Kildare, CHRO Europe, described how IBM has used cognitive technology and analytics to support internal mobility, executive hiring, career development and workforce planning as well as a Manager’s Playbook (see <strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong>) that supports managers and helps them personalise coaching to employees. Similarly, Ian Bailie highlighted how Cisco has developed capability to push recommendations to employees around areas such as mobility, learning and career pathing.</p>, <p><em>Figure 9: Example of how IBM uses analytics and cognitive to support manager interactions with employees</em></p>, <p>The shift from ‘engagement’ to ‘experience’ when it comes to listening and understanding employees, and linking this to business performance was rightly described by several speakers as a huge opportunity for people analytics. The cognitive tools described in #11 and developed at IBM and Cisco (see also <strong><em>Figure 10</em></strong> below) for their employees are two examples of this. A third came from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-hierl-1488932/"" target=""_blank"">Stefan Hierl</a> of Adidas, who described how the sportswear giant has harnessed techniques used to understand customer experience (e.g. NPS) and applied this to employees. This is an area of HR – and people analytics – that is set to grow significantly.</p>, <p><em>Figure 10: Ian Bailie described how Cisco is pushing data and personalised recommendations to Cisco employees</em></p>, <p>As the focus on data sources shifts to new and emerging people data sources (e.g. email, health/wellbeing, internal/external social media) so the focus on ethics, privacy and trust intensifies. Marielle Sönnenberg, Global Director HR Strategy &amp; Analytics at Wolters Kluwer), captured the mood perfectly by emphasising that when it comes to people analtics “<em>we have to be right – it’s about people and people’s lives</em>”. Employee trust needs to be put at the front and centre of people analytics strategies and is unquestionably the most important part of doing analytics. We can’t afford to get it wrong. We have not only a legal but a moral responsibility to employees and getting it wrong could set back people analytics years and cause irreparable damage to employee trust. It is not surprising therefore that the closing panel on ethics and consent provoked hot debate and differences of opinion. It was certainly a lively finish to the conference. For those interested in this subject, I highly recommend participating in <a href=""https://www.research.net/r/PeopleDataEthics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>this survey</strong></a>, which is being coordinated by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs-55173316/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> – participants will receive a report that will cover the items in <strong><em>Figure 11</em></strong> below.</p>, <p><em>Figure 11: Click on the picture above to participate in the People Data &amp; Ethics Survey</em></p>, <p>With three parallel tracks at #PAWorld, it was impossible to see all the sessions – I’m working on the David Green bot for next year!

I implore those that were at these sessions to add their key takeaways to the comments.</p>, <p>Having had the honour of chairing People Analytics World for the last three years, I continue to be impressed how the conference has grown and continues to improve year on year. It deserves its reputation as the premier conference in Europe on people analytics.

David R. Green,"April 5, 2017",Key takeaways from Wharton People Analytics conference 2017,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/key-takeaways-from-wharton-people-analytics-conference-david-green/,"[<p>Last week I attended the fourth edition of the <a href=""https://wpa.wharton.upenn.edu/conference/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wharton People Analytics Conference</a>, hosted by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cade-massey-8036282/"" target=""_blank"">Cade Massey</a>, in Philadelphia. Here are my key takeaways from a fabulous two days.</p>, <p>I was motivated to attend the conference because of the many superlatives I’d received from practitioners that I respect. #WhartonPAC 2017 didn’t disappoint. The content at times was inspirational, the forum it provided for networking, sharing ideas and learning was superb and I met a number of practitioners who told me that this was the only conference they attend on people analytics. So, yes, the Wharton People Analytics conference is worthy of the hype and that has to be the first key takeaway.</p>, <p><em>Wharton PAC hosts Adam Grant and Cade Massey discuss the surge of interest in people analytics</em></p>, <p>Diversity was a central theme throughout the conference. <a href=""http://linkedin.com/in/maxine-williams-7697485"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Maxine Williams</a>, Facebook’s Global Head of Diversity, contested, in a powerful speech sans slides, that people analytics was failing to address the needs of underrepresented (in this case, black and Latino) groups in tech. The problem Williams documented concerned people analysts advising her that the <em>n</em> sizes (number or sample size) are too small for the science to kick in or as Williams put it “<em>if there was more of you, we could tell you why there was so few of you</em>”. The irony, of course, is that means practitioners like Williams have to rely solely on experience and instinct – the very skills that people analytics is supposed to augment and greatly enhance. Whilst qualitative data can help complement the quantitative data that is available, the impact of institutional marginalisation also needs to be weighted. Williams’ call for a “<em>Moneyball for diversity</em>”, at least when it applies to underrepresented groups certainly lay down the gauntlet to delegates, although many I spoke afterwards felt that Williams could have said more about the initiatives, experiments and to a degree successes that have been conducted in the field.</p>, <p><em>Maxine Williams of Facebook delivers her conference keynote</em></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arun-sundar-2290237/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Sundar</a> writes in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/diversity-isnt-number-state-mind-thoughts-from-wharton-arun-sundar"" target=""_blank"">this excellent article</a>, which was inspired by the conference, diversity must not simply be regarded as a ‘number’. Indeed as Adam Grant urged in his closing address, it’s not enough to reduce bias. Instead, we need to create experiences that make people empathise. Refreshingly, the conference provided several examples of diversity, and more to the point inclusiveness, in the context of analytics in action:</p>, <p>This was the question posed for the project presented at the conference by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, who leads Microsoft’s people analytics team and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryantfuller/"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Fuller</a>. For the managers out there – at least those at Microsoft, you can rest easy as the research demonstrated that managers do matter. The findings were fascinating in that it was factors such as managers with large networks, who provide consistent access and one-to-one time whilst promoting collaboration and work-life balance that fostered higher engagement, better performance and a stronger sense of belonging in their employees. Managers who work less hours and who send fewer emails out of work correlated with happier, more productive employees who are better able to manage their work-life balance. For more on Microsoft’s people analytics journey please <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green"" target=""_blank"">see my interview with Dawn</a>. </p>, <p><em>Highlights from Microsoft's Case Study presentation of 'Do managers matter' with top-left Dawn Klinghoffer and Ryan Fuller from Microsoft plus interviewer Martine Haas from Wharton Business School</em></p>, <p>The majority of the data Microsoft used to investigate if managers matter came from email meta data. For some, this is regarded as ‘creepy’ and the subject of employee trust and privacy was a constant theme throughout the two days. Whenever I speak to practitioners about the challenges they face, trust and privacy is always in the top three. Kieran Snyder summarised it perfectly: “<em>the next decade will define the appetite for privacy versus benefit</em>” and certainly employee trust needs to be placed at the front and centre of any people analytics strategy. Dawn Klinghoffer explained how Microsoft communicated what they were doing and why, as well as laying out the benefits to employees (see <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/empower-your-employees-leverage-own-data-kathleen-hogan?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">this blog</a> by Microsoft CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a> for more on this). </p>, <p>Being the last function of the business to adopt a data-driven approach may be embarrassing but it does mean that providing HR is prepared to put its head above the parapet it can draw plenty of experience and learning from outside the function. Marketing for example, as remarked by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterfader/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Fader</a>, has been fighting the same battle for 30 years. The conference offered plenty of inspiration from elsewhere including from sport and medicine. In his entertaining interview with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielpink/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Pink</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Adam Silver</a> (NBA Commissioner) conveyed how analytics has revolutionised basketball across a multitude of areas from the uptake in three-point shots to informing strategies around resting players. Silver revealed that NBA players are equipped with wearables and sleep monitors and that this is accepted as normal - a precursor to the future workplace? Perhaps even more powerfully, <a href=""http://linkedin.com/in/rosalind-picard-0111bb"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rosalind Picard</a> from MIT spoke to an enthralled audience on how analytics has helped autism and epilepsy patients live more fulfilling and safer lives. The <a href=""https://www.empatica.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empatica</a> device that predicts seizures was designed as a result of exploring unexpected data – a prompt as Picard said to dig a little deeper when the data is strange. In a similar vein, a session on applying gaming to people analytics led by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/emollick/"" target=""_blank"">Ethan Mollick</a>, revealed how a paediatric oncology game had enabled patients to adopt a more positive mindset - resulting in huge shifts in white blood cell count and other positive immune response indicators (thanks Kieran Snyder for capturing this point).</p>, <p>Much of the innovation in the people analytics space is being provided through the vendor community, and many of these firms were present at the conference. The companies that caught my eye (in no particular order) were: <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a>, <a href=""http://www.alderbrookegroup.com/alderbrooke-culture/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CultureScope</a>, <a href=""https://www.concentra.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Concentra Analytics</a>, <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a>, <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a>, <a href=""https://www.twinelabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twine</a>, <a href=""https://peakon.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peakon</a>, <a href=""https://www.glintinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glint</a> and <a href=""https://textio.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Textio</a>.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/malcolm-gladwell"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Malcolm Gladwell</a> opened the conference with the cautionary tale of the ‘neurotic tortoise’ (see more in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/neurotic-tortoises-what-tell-us-assessment-tom-marsden"" target=""_blank"">this excellent article</a> by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-marsden-b04282/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Marsden</a>) and the danger of assessment and selection methodology that doesn’t correlate to performance. In his interview with Adam Grant afterwards, Gladwell adopted a pessimistic approach to analytics remarking he is “<em>more worried about becoming too dependent on analytics rather than not being dependent enough</em>” and adding chillingly that he was “<em>not optimistic about how analytics will go in the future</em>”. 24 hours later, in closing the conference, Grant warned of the dangers of having “<em>too much of a good thing</em>” when it comes to analytics and urged the importance for people analytics to be focused on eradicating bias, increasing empathy and reducing defensiveness. As Grant commented, there is a danger that we like the data until it disagrees with what we believe. Instead, we need to get to the point where we express joy when the data shows we are wrong and couple it with judgement to make better decisions. Data alone is not enough. Data augmented with human judgement is the key to better decision-making for the benefit of the business – and for employees.   </p>, <p>The conference confirmed my thinking beforehand that people analytics is moving towards a second phase of evolution – even if many organisations are yet to even embark on their analytics journey in HR. As well as the focus on teams (see #4) and productivity data (see #5), speakers talked about the use of physiological data to measure health and wellness (Anita Woolley), providing employees with the means to give and receive feedback (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thestevenhuang/"" target=""_blank"">Steven Huang</a>), using network analytics to measure employee interaction and collaboration (Kieran Snyder) and measuring the link between organisational loneliness and attrition (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty-94040a/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a>). Several speakers described our increased ability to analyse unstructured data or as Cade Massey put it  “<em>text analysis now is as easy to run as regression</em>”. Finally, Adam Grant spoke of how analytics is being used to improve collaboration and culture from the bottom up. All in all, if people analytics can overcome some of the challenges it faces such as privacy concerns (see #5), HR capability and fear, and institutionalising the practice then the future looks rosy.</p>, <p><em>Adam Grant closes the Wharton People Analytics Conference 2017</em></p>, <p>Finally, I’d like to highlight the competition winners and give thanks to the organisers.

David R. Green,"March 6, 2017",Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-20-hr-analytics-articles-jan-feb-2017-david-green/,"[<p>The continued growth in people analytics takes many forms. Whether that’s increased adoption by organisations, the rise in the number of conferences devoted to the subject or the sheer number of articles published on the topic.</p>, <p>This is all wonderful, but it does mean I have had to revisit the number of times per year that I collate, shortlist and publish my favourite selection of articles on people analytics and data driven HR. In 2014 and 2015, it was once per year. Last year, it was twice. This year it seems that bi-monthly is the absolute minimum.</p>, <p>So, here are the articles that stood out for me in January and February 2017:</p>, <p>We start with not one, but two key takeaway summaries from the superb <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; The Future of Work</a> (PAFOW) conference convened and hosted by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> in San Francisco at the beginning of February. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/teuschb/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Teusch</a> captures a selection of the many highlights from a memorable two days and focuses on a number of emerging trends in the space such as creating business impact, optimising the employee experience and the increasing focus companies are placing on understanding and driving team performance. In his round-up, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jpholmes/"" target=""_blank"">Julian Holmes</a> similarly emphasises the need for people analytics projects to have business relevance (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below). Julian also highlights two other trends in the space: i) the increasing role analytics is playing in underpinning organisational design and transformation, and ii) how a number of companies are building people analytics applications in-house such as <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ernestngphd/"" target=""_blank"">Ernest Ng</a> demonstrated he is doing at Salesforce.  </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: Activities that will make workforce analytics more relevant to the business (Source: Julian Holmes)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>From the best people analytics conference in North America (<a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW</a>) to it’s pre-eminent counterpart in Europe – <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tucana’s People Analytics conference series</a>. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcarty/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Carty</a> draws the bulk of his five essentials from the talks given by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmatthewman/"" target=""_blank"">Jim Matthewman</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> at the People Analytics Forum in London in November 2016, coupled with a telling quote from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> that <em>“Analytics is no longer a ‘good idea’ for HR – it is now mandatory”</em>. Look out too for Chakrabarti’s advice on the key role required of HRBPs in making analytics the <em>‘new normal’</em> for HR, as well as Ferrar’s three key principles for communicating the insights from people analytics projects to decision makers in the business (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below). I will be chairing <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a>, which takes place in London on 25-26 April. Check-out the stellar <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/public/PAWorld17_Agenda.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">line up of speakers</a>, and <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/register-people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">register here</a> using the code DG25 for a 25% discount.</p>, <p><em>Jonathan Ferrar delivers the keynote opening speech at Tucana's People Analytics Forum in London, November 2016 (Photo: Tucana)</em></p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Three Principles of Storytelling (Source: The Power of People by Nigel Guenole, Sheri Feinzig &amp; Jonathan Ferrar)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This is a wonderful article. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a>, one of the pioneers of data driven HR and presently leading the Talent Analytics function at Apple, revisits an article he wrote six years ago that provides guidance to a friend in the early stages of their people analytics journey. The advice offered still rings true today and anyone in the position that Amit’s friend was six years ago would do well to heed the guidance proffered. The company Amit’s friend still works for grew from strength to strength, went public, dominates its market and has steadily increased the size of its highly regarded people analytics team. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Most practitioners tasked with setting up a people analytics practice have to manage with limited budget and resources. In the face of high expectations, how do you succeed? <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-starbuck-ph-d-a48a6823/"" target=""_blank"">Craig Starbuck</a>, HR Reporting &amp; Analytics Manager at Scottrade, shares his experiences of doing exactly this and provides ten guidelines for success. This is a truly engrossing and insightful read and it is hard to choose the best of Craig’s tips, but my favourite three are: Think Pro-Employee, Coalesce Around a Shared Vision and Facilitate and Demonstrate the ROI. Craig and the team at Scottrade won two awards at the <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/DarrenGrantKaplan/hiq-labs-people-analytics-awards-hosted-at-intel"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Elevate Awards</a> in October 2016, and it’s easy to see why when reading this. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzocanlas/"" target=""_blank"">Lorenzo Canlas</a> heads up Talent Analytics at LinkedIn and in his previous article (featured in my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/30-best-hr-analytics-articles-2016-david-green"" target=""_blank"">30 best People Analytics articles of 2016</a>), he revealed that the ROI of his team is forecast to be 10X the cost of the team in 2017. This follow-up article explains one of the secrets to their success, which is founded upon understanding the three project types, the differing outcomes and the needs of their business partners for each type. These three types - inform, insight, or actions &amp; accountability – and their corresponding ‘Conditions of Success’ (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below) are then described together with examples. Yet another insightful article from Lorenzo.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: The three types of people analytics projects and their conditions of success (Source: Lorenzo Canlas)</em></p>, <p>It is rare that a day passes by without me reading at least one article on how artificial intelligence is set to revolutionise HR. It’s certainly true that a number of organisations that have reached a degree of maturity in people analytics are actively exploring how cognitive apps and machine learning can augment what they are already doing. This IBM research digs beneath the hype and provides findings on i) CEO/CHRO views on cognitive computing, ii) employee willingness to receive guidance from cognitive HR solutions, iii) the three areas in which HR is already leveraging cognitive - talent acquisition, talent development and HR operations and iv) recommendations for companies looking to take their first steps. </p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Highlights of IBM Institute for Business Value Cognitive HR Study (Source: IBM)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Deloitte’s <a href=""http://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/focus/human-capital-trends.html?id=us:2el:3pr:dup3575:awa:cons:022817:hct17"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Global Human Capital Trends</a> is always a captivating read and the 2017 edition published just last week is no exception. First, Josh Bersin provides an executive summary of the 10 trends featured in the report, with an additional emphasis on what is perhaps the main finding of the study – that AI and robotics are entering the workforce much faster than we may have thought. Bersin's article itself is an absolute must-read. The same goes for the section on people analytics in the actual report itself. The headline finding is that people analytics is “<em>no longer about finding interesting information and flagging it for managers</em>” but is being utilised to “<em>understand every part of a business operation</em>” with analytical tools “<em>being embedded into day-to-day decision making</em>”. A detailed example from Chevron is provided, as are eight factors the authors believe are fundamental to creating a people analytics program. There are a number of invaluable insights in the report not least <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below depicting the old and new rules of people analytics. A must-read. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><em>Figure 5: People Analytics - Old rules vs. New rules (Source: Deloitte University Press)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the most knowledgeable and progressive practitioners I’ve had the pleasure of coming across in the people analytics space is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe/"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a>, who now heads up people analytics at JP Morgan Chase. Ian has previously held leadership roles at Google, Sears and American Express. Hence he has a unique vantage point to describe how different organisations leverage data to understand their people and has a wide array of experiences to draw from when talking about what works and what doesn't. As such, this episode of the superb hiQ Labs podcast is a must-listen as host <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhousman/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Housman</a> and Ian have a fascinating and insightful conversation.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> wrote in his <a href=""http://marketing.bersin.com/predictions-for-2017.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">2017 HR Predictions</a>, we need to rethink organisational design around how work actually gets done in the 21st century. As illustrated in <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below, this means moving from a traditional functional hierarchy to one that enables multi-functional teams to thrive. This is where Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) and its modern day counterpart Social Network Analysis (SNA) comes in. The opportunities this offers HR leaders and people analysts is perfectly described by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> of <a href=""http://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> in this excellent article. Learn how ONA has evolved from a paper based process into a real time continuous flow of data that has transformed the ability of companies to map their informal networks and understand how work really gets done. Newman provides examples of how ONA/SNA can help identify influential employees, support succession planning, identify good/bad leadership behaviours and collaboration. </p>, <p><em>Figure 6: How work gets done (Source: Bersin by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p>One of the most prolific and best writers on people analytics is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a>. I particularly enjoyed this recent article, which analyses a <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/the-need-to-lead-in-data-and-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">recent McKinsey study</a> that found that 86% of executives are still not getting value from analytics. Tracey focuses on the importance of the role of the analytics leader, their position within the organisation (the higher, the better), the need for them to ‘get out into the business’, and the importance of prioritisation and focus. An essential read for any current or aspiring people analytics leader.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing one of the themes picked up by Tracey Smith, this HBR article by <a href=""http://dataqualitysolutions.com/meet-the-data-doc"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Thomas C. Redman</a> makes the case that to be good at their job, a data scientist needs to get out into the business. Only then can they learn how the data is collected, understand the wider context, flesh out the specific problem and present insights in a language that will be understood and therefore implemented by the relevant stakeholders. Redman offers some great examples that whilst falling outside the realm of people analytics can easily be applied to the practice. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> has rapidly emerged as one of the best sources of people analytics articles around. This guest post by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> is a perfect example. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman’s monumental ‘<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0141033576"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Thinking Fast and Slow</a>’ and Rolf Dobelli’s ‘<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Thinking-Clearly-Better-Decisions/dp/1444759566/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1488280116&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+thinking+clearly+rolf+dobelli"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Art of Thinking Clearly</a>’, Haak summarises 15 cognitive biases that are relevant to the work and results of people analytics projects. As Haak states “<em>there is a benefit for people analytics professionals to learn more about psychology and important cognitive biases, because no one is exempt from these biases</em>”. Check out too <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong> below for <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/busterbenson/"" target=""_blank"">Buster Benson</a>’s <a href=""http://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18#.vzic898hq"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cognitive Bias Sheet</a>, to which Haak refers. </p>, <p><em>Figure 7: Cognitive Bias Codex (Source: John Manoogian III and Buster Benson)</em></p>, <p>As <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> writes in this insightful article, the way we measure employee engagement is changing. From a demand perspective, HR is playing catch-up with its peers in marketing who have adopted Voice of the Customer practices to gain deep insights to inform product and service strategies. Andrew then digs into the technologies that are revolutionising the supply side, which he breaks down into four categories: automation (which as illustrated in <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong> below is enabling a rethink of the end-to-end process), changes to mobile and user interfaces, big data technology (to support people analytics) and machine learning (text analytics and predictive). Andrew is an acknowledged expert in the fields of engagement and people analytics, so this is certainly a recommended read. </p>, <p><em>Figure 8: Rethinking the end-to-end employee feedback process (Source: Andrew Marritt | Workometry, Organization View)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If analytics is to become part of the DNA of HR then it simply has to embraced by HR Business Partners (HRBPs). As <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman/"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a> contends in this excellent guest post on <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a>, the long-term success of your people analytics program depends on it. The challenge is that many HRBPs are notoriously busy and not natural bedfellows for analytics. Creelman offers some invaluable advice on how to enthuse, equip and enable HRBPs and move them to the centre of your analytics equation. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The third entrant from one of <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a>’s guest bloggers is this lengthy but riveting article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/senguptaraja/"" target=""_blank"">Raja Sengupta</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/soumyasanto/"" target=""_blank"">Soumyasanto Sen</a>. The article demystifies a ‘hot topic’ within HR and People Analytics – that of natural language processing (NLP). It describes the relevance of NLP to HR, the key benefits (and applications – see <strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong> below), how it augments rather than automates HR processes and the vendor landscape as well as providing a case study of NLP in the recruiting process. There’s plenty to digest and learn from here. </p>, <p><em>Figure 9: Key application areas of Natural Language Processing in HR (Source: Analytics in HR, Raja Sengupta &amp; Soumyasanto Sen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Articles from <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> have rather dominated this collection, which is testament to the wonderful service <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/nandosteenhuis/"" target=""_blank"">Nando Steenhuis</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen/"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> are providing to the people analytics community. This article by van Vulpen describes the importance of cleaning data and offers a helpful descriptive and visual (see <strong><em>Figure 10</em></strong>) six-step guide in how to actually do it. The checklist is featured in van Vulpen’s book – ‘<a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/ebook-basic-principles-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Basic Principles of People Analytics</a>’, which I heartily recommend to anyone starting out in the people analytics space.</p>, <p><em>Figure 10: Six-Step guide to data cleaning (Source: Analytics in HR | Basic Principles of People Analytics book by Erik van Vulpen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This short but highly apposite article by <a href=""http://linkedin.com:in:anouska-ramsay-7050825"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Anouska Ramsay</a>, UK Talent Director at Capgemini really resonates. We mustn’t forget the ‘people’ element when we are doing people analytics. Whilst analytics can help identify insights that we can then test and implement, we need to remember those people within our businesses that don’t necessarily fit the trend but are also some of our best performers. This is a timely reminder from Anouska and one that highlights the role psychologists can play in interpreting results and as <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> <a href=""http://mortenkamp.com/2014/06/02/how-you-create-a-superhero-analytics-team/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">has written</a> ‘<em>turn information into knowledge</em>’ and mitigate bias and cognitive dissonance. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As interest and adoption of people analytics continues to rise, more and more organisations are looking to hire people who can lead, build and embed this capability within their companies. As <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68/"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> writes in this article, this is no easy task – great people analytics leaders are in short supply and high demand. Hill then offers some helpful advice to recruiters that should help with their search such as who the role should report to (preferably the CHRO) and not to confuse analytics with MI/reporting (a common mistake). </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/beneubanks/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Eubanks</a> is one of my favourite industry analysts. In this article, he draws on research he has undertaken to understand how companies globally are hiring people analytics talent, and outlines three options: build, buy or borrow together with a use case for each one. I’ve seen organisations use one or more of these three options as they build out their people analytics capability. A great article for organisations looking to start, grow or scale their analytics teams.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Last, but certainly not least, <a href=""http://linkedin.com:in:thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> draws on some fascinating research from Stanford highlighting the role music plays in analytics. As Thomas explains, “t<em>he research team showed that music engages the areas of the brain involved with paying attention, making predictions and updating the event in memory</em>”. So, perhaps Thomas has uncovered a previously hitherto unforeseen secret of doing great people analytics.

David R. Green,"February 13, 2017",Laszlo Bock on the future of HR & his new venture,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/laszlo-bock-future-hr-his-new-venture-david-green/,"[<p>Along with the likes of <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock"" target=""_blank""><strong>Laszlo Bock</strong></a> is one of the leading global authorities on the future of the HR function and the critical role that people analytics and data science has in driving this forward. When Bock speaks, the world listens.</p>, <p>The clamour for Bock’s thoughts has intensified since he announced in 2016 that he was leaving his role as SVP, People Operations (CHRO) at Google. What will he do next? Will he unveil some of the mystique about Google’s fabled approach to people? What does he believe the future of work and HR will be?</p>, <p>Some of these questions are addressed in a fascinating interview Bock gave to Steve Bates of SHRM in February 2017 (<a href=""http://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/Pages/Laszlo-Bock-Future-HR-Data-Science.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">read full article</a>).</p>, <p>Bock cites people analytics as the next stage in the evolution of HR and groups companies into two types when it comes to applying an analytical approach, which I’ve classified 'Believers' and 'Doubters':</p>, <p>Or ‘fast followers’ as Bock describes them: those companies that will be inspired to ‘really dig into analytical questions’ such as ‘Is performance management really working? Is compensation really fair?’ ‘We think our people are the best – how do we really know they’re the best and how do we make them better?’ Bock suggests that some organisations are going to implement people analytics ‘very, very quickly and they’ll be successful’.</p>, <p>On the flip side of the coin, Bock believes that many companies will fail to see the opportunity offering excuses such as ‘Oh I can’t do that, it’s too hard; my manager doesn’t support it; the company doesn’t want to do it; we don’t have the head count; it’s too risky.’ I share Bock’s fears that a lot of companies will be left behind.</p>, <p>The opportunity to bring insight to the HR profession has never been bigger – the knowledge to do it and the systems to support it both exist. As Bock says ‘there’s not a better time to be in it (HR) if you care about change and improvement’.</p>, <p>The article also provides a clue as to what Bock is planning next. Whilst he admits his new start-up is ‘very, very early in building this out’, it appears to be that he is developing an application that will help make work better and improve employee productivity. Bock teases that his team know what it will look like, they have the science behind it and that it will be available on mobile and as a plug-in to a corporate network. The intrigue and speculation that will undoubtedly accompany the application as it is built will make Bock’s new venture the HR technology version of the next Star Wars movie.</p>, <p><em>WATCH: Laszlo Bock on making work better</em></p>, <p>The article also delves into Bock’s thoughts on other subjects such as:</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/Pages/Laszlo-Bock-Future-HR-Data-Science.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Read the full SHRM interview here</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>All of us in the people analytics space owe a debt of gratitude to Bock. Whilst he and Google weren’t the first to embrace the possibilities of people analytics and data driven HR, he did more than anyone to popularise the space and provided an inspiration to other curious folk. Bock’s ‘Work Rules!’ book, published in 2015, should be on the bedside table of every forward-thinking CHRO or aspiring HR leader. That is why there is so much interest in what Bock does next and the advice he offers. For more on the impact that Bock has had on people analytics, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-game-changer-changing-his-darren-grant-kaplan?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">read this wonderful tribute by Darren Kaplan</a>.</p>, <p><em>WATCH: An animation of Laszlo Bock's Work Rules! book</em></p>, <p>I like how Bock classifies the two types of organisation/HR leader when it comes to people analytics, which tallies almost completely with what I have observed. Those that are curious or inspired by the opportunity analytics provides to help their companies make better decisions have typically succeeded in growing their capability in this area – especially when <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-constitutes-best-practice-people-analytics-david-green?trk=pulse_spock-articles"" target=""_blank"">they exhibit these traits and competencies</a>. However, ‘the doubters’ or those who are seemingly impotent in getting started (e.g. those I’ve come across at conferences who have been ‘thinking of getting started’ – bit still haven’t - for four years now) are being seriously left behind.</p>, <p>As Mark Twain is reputed to have said ‘the secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one’. Bock is an inspirational example for others in the HR fraternity who want to make a difference.</p>, <p><em><strong>David</strong> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

David R. Green,"January 23, 2017",The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/30-best-hr-analytics-articles-2016-david-green/,"[<p>People Analytics and data driven HR continues to generate huge amounts of interest amongst those working in or associated with the field of human resources.</p>, <p>The potential analytics has to underpin the future transformation of HR with regards to digital, personalising the employee experience and identifying actionable insights that lead to better business outcomes is recognised by many but to date has only been realised by few.</p>, <p>For the last three years, I’ve collected what I believe are the best people analytics articles of the preceding 12 months. The purpose is to (hopefully) provide a useful resource for those already operating in or those who aspire to work in the field of people analytics (see collections from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-2014-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2014</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21-best-hr-analytics-articles-2015-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2015</em></a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/27-best-hr-analytics-articles-h1-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2016 Jan-Jun</em></a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2016 Jul-Dec</em></a>).</p>, <p>I have been motivated to do this ‘Best of 2016’ piece because I missed (either due to publication date or my own human error) seven articles from my previous two 2016 collections. These articles are too good not to be recognised, so without further ado and in no particular order…</p>, <p>It may seem strange to begin with an article that was published in 2015, but having somehow not included it 12 months ago, it only seems fair to start with what is one of the most important articles on people analytics I have read. The white paper provides a critique of the HR centric approach adopted by the majority of organisations when it comes to analytics and instead advocates an “outside-in” method targeted at solving real business problems. Two excellent examples from Maersk Drilling are highlighted to support the argument. Case 1 (see <em><strong>Figure 1</strong></em> below) examines the impact of leadership quality and crew competence on safety, operational performance, and customer satisfaction whilst Case 2 examines the ROI and Strategic Impact of a Technical Trainee Acceleration Program. As the article reveals, both cases show that analytics is far more effective when tackled from a business (rather than an inward looking HR) perspective and that analytics should be treated as a change management process. <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> is Vice-President of HR Data and Analytics at Shell, which is often (and rightly) cited as one of the leading practices on the planet.

As Anthony correctly highlights, the volume of analytical insights continues to grow and whilst this is positive it is arguably a waste if these insights do not lead to <em><strong>meaningful</strong></em> actions that help <em><strong>drive</strong></em> business results. Anthony highlights four key areas of focus and suggests how these gaps between insights and action can be bridged. The four areas are: i) lack of alignment between business strategy and analytics, ii) missing skills in the analytics team (e.g. storytelling, influencing, consulting), iii) cultural impediments that block or slow down action, and; iv) the absence of feedback mechanisms to understand the impact of actions.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the smartest HR leaders I’ve had the pleasure to come across, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/placidjover"" target=""_blank"">Placid Jover</a> was recently appointed to lead HR for Unilever’s £3 billion UK business. Previously, Placid had established and led Unilever’s global Organisation Performance and HR Analytics team. In this thoughtful article, Placid reflects on his experiences, how the space has evolved and what the future holds for analytics and how it will underpin the HR of the future. Like the previous two articles, Placid emphasises the importance of focusing on insights that lead to business outcomes. A must-read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the previous article, Placid highlighted that Unilever is fortunate to have a CHRO who embraces data and lives and breathes the insight it brings to the organisation and people agendas. The role of the CHRO is pivotal, as <a href=""http://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a>, Co-Founder of <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a>, makes clear in this article for the <a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRN Blog</a>. Luk makes an impassioned plea for CHROs to work closely with their HR Analytics leader arguing that this is how HR can have a demonstrable impact on business results. The second article - an interview with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>, former HR Analytics leader and now CHRO, illustrates Luk’s point perfectly. Mark argues that when executed correctly people analytics can be the “<em>GPS of HR</em>”, as he answers with typical candour and insight a series of questions on people analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing Luk’s theme, having a CHRO who not only sponsors but is involved in driving the people analytics initiative is a common <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-constitutes-best-practice-people-analytics-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">best practice</a> I have seen in organisations that are successful in this space. One such CHRO is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a>. The first article describes how Microsoft is using analytics to help employees and teams to become more productive. More importantly, it also tackles the question of employee trust. Hogan emphasises that the purpose is to empower rather than undermine employee decision-making and articulates her vision of creating the ability for employees to own their data, improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance. Read more on Microsoft’s people analytics journey in my interview with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, who leads the HR Business Insights team <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and also an in-depth case study on the excellent <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valuing your Talent</a> site <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/research-resources/case-studies/microsoft"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>When I speak to people analytics leaders, the topic of ethics and trust is never far from the top of the list. <a href=""http://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> believes that trust is the most important part of doing great people analytics, and I’m inclined to agree with him. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data. Not only does it affect the quality of data available, it also makes people analytics initiatives unsustainable. The Virtuous Circle of Data Quality (see <em><strong>Figure 2</strong></em> below), conceptualised by Andrew, provides a convincing case for placing employee trust at the heart of any people analytics strategy.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: The Virtuous circle of data quality (Source: Andrew Marritt | Organization View)</em></p>, <p>One of the best events I attended last year was SHRM’s 18th Thought Leaders Retreat on using workforce analytics for competitive advantage. The event featured some of the leading academics and practitioners in the field and this article captures the many insights that were outlined and discussed over the two days. To pick just four examples: i) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a> highlighted that the value of analytics is in discovering how it can make a difference to the organisation, ii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> (see also Alec’s superb <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-solemnly-swear-hr-data-analytics-manifesto-alec-levenson?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">HR Analytics manifesto</a>) describing how analysing at the team level, rather than the individual level, can offer bigger returns, iii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>’s advice that sometimes it’s the quick wins that make leaders come back and ask for more, and; iv) that greater use of analytics requires HR leaders to think hard about ethical factors: what data is used, how it is used, how data is protected, and in what ways use of data and analytics might cross an ethical line. For more on using workforce analytics for competitive advantage also see <a href=""http://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/shapingthefuture/documents/eiu%20theme%203%20analytics%20report-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this white paper</a> published by SHRM two months prior to the retreat.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Intel's People Analytics methodology (Source: Alexis Fink | SHRM)</em></p>, <p>Published just a day after my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">H2 2016 collection</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra"" target=""_blank""><em>Amit Mohindra</em></a> was right to highlight that this superb article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzocanlas"" target=""_blank""><em>Lorenzo Canlas</em></a>, Head of Talent Analytics at LinkedIn, demanded inclusion. Lorenzo describes how his team has refined its mission to helping leaders use talent as a lever to achieve business objectives and how their success is defined as having a measurable impact to business or talent metrics. As Amit also commented the evolution Lorenzo describes from ""arming decision-makers"" to actively participating in the intervention/solution is game-changing. The financial return (see <em><strong>Figure 4</strong></em> below) of Lorenzo’s team demonstrates the significant impact that people analytics can have. Lorenzo goes on to cite several examples of the work his team has undertaken such as that impressively outlined in the second article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a>. This describes how a single project to better forecast and plan for how many recruiters were needed as the organisation scaled at over 40% a year, including where and when they were needed, predicted within 5% the actual numbers hired, saved the company 15% of its recruiting budget in year one and consequently paid for talent analytics for over four years. The Slideshare below, which was presented by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifershappley"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Shappley</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/phamchristopher"" target=""_blank"">Chris Pham</a> at Talent Connect, also recounts this outstanding project.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The ROI of LinkedIn's Talent Analytics team (Source: Lorenzo Canlas)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Storytelling is the last mile problem in analytics. Fail to develop a compelling story for your stakeholder and even great insights and analysis will be for nothing. In this article, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> highlights a <a href=""http://futurehrtrends.eiu.com/report-2016/executive-summary/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">study by SHRM</a> that reveals this is a skill lacking in many HR analytics efforts. He then recounts an excellent example of powerful storytelling from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>. Jonathan is co-writing a book - 'The Power of People' (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">pre-order here</a>) on people analytics, which is due to be published in May 2017 and will feature a whole chapter on storytelling from where <em><strong>Figure 5</strong></em> below is extracted.

Choosing just one article was difficult, but I’ve plumped for this excellent piece by <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> on five reasons why HR Analytics projects fail. It’s an invaluable guide for anyone working in a people analytics role, especially those just getting started – as is the recent book (in which a version of the article also appears) (<a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/ebook-basic-principles-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>The basic principles of People Analytics</em></a>) Erik and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/nandosteenhuis"" target=""_blank"">Nando Steenhuis</a> have published.

This article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a> (also a <a href=""http://twitter.com/EvanSinar"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">must-follow on Twitter</a>) and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/richwellins"" target=""_blank"">Rich Wellins</a> describes the skills and traits HR needs, how well (or not) the function is prepared (see <em><strong>Figure 9</strong></em> below, which had over 30,000 views when I shared it on LinkedIn before Christmas!) and the relationships in the business that can best help propel HR forward.</p>, <p><em>Figure 9: What HR needs to thrive with Analytics (Source: DDI)</em></p>, <p>One of the more impressive stories I’ve heard on building organisational capability in people analytics comes from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a> and his team at Chevron. This detailed Bersin by Deloitte Case Study* comes in two parts. Part 1 describes how Chevron tackled its challenge to scale, unify and grow analytics capabilities across the organisation, making it an essential skill for all HR professionals and ultimately turn people analytics into a competitive advantage. The key focus was the business rather than HR and steps to achieve this included i) implementing a vision and mission statement to help create an identity, ii) consistently reviewing the metrics tracked for business relevance, and iii) creating a prioritisation mechanism for all analytics projects (see <em><strong>Figure 10</strong></em> below). Building organisational capability centred on two main strategies: i) launching a Community of Practice, which now has 300 members spread across 22 business units and 18 countries, and; ii) introducing a three-stage in-house analytics curriculum that serves to create a structured learning and development program in analytics. Part 2 of the Case Study describes two additional areas of Chevron’s analytics journey: how it built a centre of excellence to optimise its organisational structure and why it believes in leveraging analytics talent across functions. This multi-pronged approach has helped create a vast and virtual people analytics team and effectively changed the way HR and the business thinks. With this firm foundation in place, Chevron is well-positioned to derive the competitive advantage it seeks from its investment in people analytics.

In the first article above from the <a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">MIT Sloan Management Review</a>, the authors describe four lessons from customer analytics than can easily be applied to people analytics. The second article looks specifically at sentiment analysis, which has long been used by organisations to better understand its customers, and is now increasingly being used by forward-thinking organisations to get invaluable insights on their employees. Two examples from Twitter and IBM are highlighted. In the latter, the article describes how IBM used an internally developed sentiment-analysis tool called Social Pulse to engage its employees in a revamp of its performance-review system.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If people analytics is to become a core component of the future HR then it is important that everyone working within the function has a reasonable level of analytical understanding and curiosity. This excellent white paper by Nigel Guenole and Sheri Feinzig, adapted from ‘The Power of People’ book (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">pre-order here</a>) they have written together with Jonathan Ferrar, simplifies the potentially complex subject of research designs and different analytical methods. Confidence (or more to the point, the lack of it) is one of the inhibitors holding many HR professional back from embracing analytics – resources like this white paper are exactly what is needed to accelerate progress. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, Head of Global Workforce Analytics at Experian, testifies in this article, many organisations are still swimming in the slow lane when it comes to workforce analytics. As he goes on to state, it doesn’t have to be a struggle, and this is less likely to be the case if organisations and nascent analytics leaders follow the excellent advice in this article. Effective stakeholder management, building a balanced team and prioritising education and awareness are just three of the tips provided.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst this white paper provides a stark analysis on the current state of people analytics it does provide HR with some helpful home truths, which if the function doesn’t address may lead to many organisations situating people analytics outside HR. The three primary areas of deficiency highlighted by the study are i) most organisations are still only doing basic analyses (see <em><strong>Figure 11</strong></em> below), ii) poor data quality, and, therefore perhaps not unsurprisingly; iii) a lack of confidence by the business in these fledgling people analytics functions. Indeed, more companies said their people analytics team hinders their analytics work than helps it. The silver lining is that these challenges can be tackled and the report goes on to elucidate some of the practical steps that organisations can take to do just that.                                         </p>, <p><em>Figure 11 - The type of people analytics projects being undertaken today (Source: New Talent Management Network)</em></p>, <p>Many organisations decide to build a Centre of Excellence (CoE) as part of its attempt to develop people analytics capability. In this piece, <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/manojkumarhranalytics"" target=""_blank"">Manoj Kumar</a>, who led HSBC’s HR Analytics CoE for five years, outlines five reasons why a CoE may not deliver ROI within expected timelines whilst also suggesting fixes to each of these challenges.

David R. Green,"January 16, 2017",What constitutes best practice in people analytics?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-constitutes-best-practice-people-analytics-david-green/,"[<p>I’m often asked what constitutes best practice in people analytics and what is the secret sauce that enables some companies to be more successful than others in this field.</p>, <p>With a <a href=""http://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/Data-Analysis-Skills.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>recent study</em></a> by SHRM finding that 79% of organisations with 10,000 employees or more already having data analysis roles in HR, interest in people analytics continues to rise.</p>, <p>Adoption levels have not risen at the same trajectory, although venerable industry analysts such as <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin"" target=""_blank""><em>Josh Bersin</em></a> have predicted that 2017 may well be the year that people analytics goes into orbit.</p>, <p>Many organisations I speak to though are still struggling to get their people analytics program off the ground - hence being asked the aforementioned questions. I am privileged to speak on a regular basis with companies and practitioners who have had contrasting fortunes with people analytics to date. I have identified a number of common characteristics – or ingredients to the secret sauce – that those who have been successful share. Whilst undoubtedly not an exhaustive list, sixteen best practices are illustrated in <em><strong>Figure 1</strong></em> below and described thereafter:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>First and foremost, successful people analytics teams focus on projects that actually matter to the business. Don’t waste time developing a model to predict attrition if it isn’t a problem for your company. Learn the business, find out what matters to your CEO and senior leaders. If you focus your efforts on where your firm makes money then people analytics projects will quickly pay for themselves and your star within the organisation will rise.</p>, <p>Without CHRO and senior executive involvement your people analytics adventure is probably doomed from the start. Successful organisations not only have a CHRO who sponsors the people analytics program but possess one who is also heavily involved in the work and who thrives on the insights and business outcomes it enables. The CHRO should have a unique understanding of the key challenges facing the business, the seniority to enable access to the right business leaders and crucially the influence to ensure that the insights (which are invariably counterintuitive and therefore contentious) are implemented. <a href=""http://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank""><em>Luk Smeyers</em></a> has written that people analytics simply <a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/hr-analytics-you-report-to-the-chro-period/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>has to report to the CHRO</em></a> and act as their <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/starting-people-analytics-journey-needs-analysis-dont-luk-smeyers?trk=hp-feed-article-title-like"" target=""_blank""><em>right-hand intelligence officer</em></a>. I have to concur.</p>, <p>Given the relative immaturity of people analytics in most organisations and common misconceptions amongst many CHROs as to what the discipline actually entails, the role of the Head of People Analytics is of paramount importance. It is likely that s/he will possess a number of the skills and capabilities required to do the work (see #4). Ideally they will have business as well as HR experience, be able to develop a winning strategy, build organisational capability, manage stakeholders across the business and have the political astuteness required to drive actionable insights into business outcomes. I have yet to come across an organisation that has successfully implemented people analytics that doesn’t have an inspirational leader. Coupled with a fully involved CHRO they can together create an unstoppable force.</p>, <p>One reason many organisations have found it difficult to successfully adopt people analytics is the disparate skills and capabilities required to do the work (<a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/demystifying-people-analytics-part-2-skills-capabilities-need/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>see more here</em></a>). Many of these skills have not traditionally resided in HR and some organisations have made the mistake of asking their HR MIS and Reporting employees to take on analytics too, which as one people analytics leader described to me as like asking a nurse to do the job of a doctor. <em><strong>Figure 2</strong></em> below, which is based on a model created by <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen"" target=""_blank""><em>Morten Kamp Andersen</em></a> (<a href=""http://mortenkamp.com/2016/06/06/six-must-have-competencies-in-a-world-class-analytics-team/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>see article here</em></a>), provides an illustration of the skills and capabilities required and what is likely to happen if just one of those skills is missing. In this adaptation I’ve added Change Management skills (to enable insights to be implemented successfully into outcomes) and would also couple consulting together under business acumen. The leading people analytics teams are able to act as consultants to properly define business problems, develop hypotheses, problem solve and project manage. This not only ensures that the team works on the ‘right’ projects but also that these projects are properly defined.  </p>, <p><em>Figure 2: The seven competencies of a world-class People Analytics team (adapted and based on a model created by Morten Kamp Andersen) </em></p>, <p>One way to accelerate progress is to leverage (beg, borrow or steal if necessary!) resources from outside HR. Other analytics teams in the organisation will likely be more established so i) will have the skills to help plug some of the gaps in your team, ii) experience in navigating the business to turn insights into outcomes, and; iii) possess the business data you will need to gain insights into the business problems you are trying to solve. Leading organisations know that analytics is a team sport (thanks to <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475"" target=""_blank""><em>Alec Levenson</em></a> for that gem - <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/strategic-analytics-team-sport-alec-levenson?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank""><em>see here</em></a>) and embrace the opportunity to work seamlessly with colleagues across the company to help solve the most pressing problems for the business. Likewise, be open to partnering with an external provider to accelerate progress – a great example here is the partnership between ABN AMRO and <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>iNostix by Deloitte</em></a> (see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>this interview with Patrick Coolen</em></a>, Head of HR Analytics at ABN AMRO for more)</p>, <p>All the successful people analytics teams I’ve encountered not only focus on the challenges relevant to their business (see #1), but also develop a clearly defined strategy closely aligned to the business and people strategies. It is also important to set a vision as this not only creates an identity for the team but also communicates the aims and objectives of the function to the business. Some examples here include:</p>, <p>As <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232"" target=""_blank""><em>Olly Britnell</em></a>, Global Head of Workforce Analytics at Experian, advises (<a href=""http://www2.cipd.co.uk/pm/peoplemanagement/b/weblog/archive/2016/09/23/opinion-it-s-time-for-hr-to-be-bold-with-analytics.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>see here</em></a>) whilst your data does not need to be perfect to do people analytics, it does need to be credible. If that means investing six months to clean and define data as well as implementing governance procedures to ensure future data cleanliness, then so be it. Other ‘basics’ to get right include: defining policies around privacy and data security across the jurisdictions your company operates and also (closely related to #6) have a prioritisation mechanism to ensure that the team works on the right projects. <em><strong>Figure 3</strong></em> below show two examples from Chevron (left) and IBM (right). People analytics teams that don’t employ such an approach are at risk of working on the wrong projects and therefore reducing their impact.  </p>, <p><em>Figure 3: (L to R) Chevron's four-box grid for prioritising people analytics projects (Source: Chevron / Bersin by Deloitte); Analytics Project Categorisation Framework (Source: IBM Smarter Workforce Institute)</em></p>, <p>Creating and honing a clear and repeatable methodology focused on producing actionable insights is a clear differentiator between those that are successful and those that struggle with people analytics. There is currently no standard methodology for people analytics. In their book ‘<em><strong>The Power of People</strong></em>’ (to be published in May 2017 - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>pre-order here</em></a>), <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank""><em>Jonathan Ferrar</em></a>, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2"" target=""_blank""><em>Nigel Guenole</em></a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a"" target=""_blank""><em>Sheri Feinzig</em></a> interviewed 60 of the world’s leading practitioners, academics, consultants and analysts in the people analytics field. From this, they developed the eight-step methodology in <em><strong>Figure 4</strong></em> below, which is the best I’ve come across to date and should provide the perfect basis for organisations looking to create and/or refine their own methodologies.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: </em> <em>An eight-step model for purposeful analytics (Source: The Power of People - Sheri Feinzig, Nigel Guenole, Jonathan Ferrar, Pearson FT Press, to be published in May 2017 (</em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Pre-order here</em></a><em>)</em>  </p>, <p>You can create the best insights in the world, but if you don’t tell the story in a compelling way that resonates with your audience then it is highly likely that no action will be taken. That means all your hard work in collecting, cleaning and analysing data will be a waste of time. How utterly demoralising. Successful people analytics teams are adept at understanding what their audience needs to know, how they want them to feel and what they want them to do.

IBM (see <em><strong>Figure 5</strong></em> below) estimates that its Proactive Retention program (which identifies patterns of attrition to highlight proactively which populations to invest in to mitigate attrition risk) has saved the company hundreds of millions of dollars since its inception. In a recent article (see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/roi-talent-analytics-lorenzo-canlas?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzocanlas"" target=""_blank""><em>Lorenzo Canlas</em></a>, Head of Talent Analytics at LinkedIn, explained how the impact of the projects initiated by his team on operating margin is projected to be ten times the cost of his team in 2017. However, don’t expect to achieve these sorts of numbers in three to six months. People analytics initiatives require investment, time and the best practices described in this article. Don’t be afraid to start small providing the project will have enough business impact to show value and consequently gain momentum to grow and start a movement.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: IBM People Analytics Case Study - Proactive Retention Program</em></p>, <p>Employee trust (as articulated superbly by <a href=""http://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank""><em>Andrew Marritt</em></a> <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-whats-employees-andrew-marritt?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a>) is one of the most important aspects of doing great people analytics. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data. Not only does it affect the quality of data available, it also makes people analytics initiatives unsustainable in the long run. The best people analytics teams are fully aware of their legal and moral obligations in this area. Microsoft even has a lawyer as part of their people analytics team (see interview with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank""><em>Dawn Klinghoffer</em></a> of Microsoft <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a>) and ABN AMRO (see rule #5 <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-crowd-version-patrick-coolen?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a>) do not initiate or share the results from a project without getting the go-ahead from legal and compliance. As people analytics continues to evolve (see #15) expect those organisations who put the employee at the centre of what they do to flourish. </p>, <p>Creating a successful people analytics practice is a challenge but if you are going to build something that is sustainable then you need to scale it across HR – enabling, enthusing and equipping HR business partners – and effectively make analytics a core component of HR. I have seen examples of leaders and companies who have achieved this such as <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/bartvoorn"" target=""_blank""><em>Bart Voorn</em></a> at Ahold Delhaize, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-walter-3baa8a9"" target=""_blank""><em>Anthony Walter</em></a> at Gap (see <a href=""http://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/identify-and-define-your-metrics-gap-inc/steps/build-analytical-credibility/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank""><em>Patrick Coolen</em></a> at ABN AMRO (see rule #7 <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-crowd-version-patrick-coolen?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor"" target=""_blank""><em>RJ Milnor</em></a> at Chevron (see detailed <a href=""http://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Bersin by Deloitte</em></a> Case Study <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/Practice/Detail.aspx?id=20290"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). In the last example, Chevron built organisational capability mainly through: i) launching a Community of Practice, which as of September 2016 comprised 300 members spread across 22 business units and 18 countries, and; ii) building a three-stage in-house analytics curriculum that serves to create a structured learning and development program in analytics. This multi-pronged approach has helped create a vast and virtual people analytics team and effectively changed the way HR and the business thinks.</p>, <p>People analytics is new (to most organisations) and everyone who works in or who aspires to work in the space has a mutual interest in the widespread adoption of the practice by business and HR. Communicating successes both internally (e.g. via internal communication platforms) and externally (e.g. via blogs and speaking at conferences) is a major element in increasing awareness and excitement levels about the potential benefits people analytics can bring. Networking externally provides the additional benefit of hearing and seeing at first hand the types of research peers and academia are doing. Where relevant to one’s own business this can help inspire future project ideas. The people analytics community is collaborative and shared learning is certainly one of the drivers pushing the practice forward.</p>, <p>The best people analytics practitioners I’ve met are highly intelligent, naturally curious and have an insatiable appetite to learn and broaden their horizons. They are not afraid to fail (occasionally!) and understand that not every research project will produce insights and not every insight will be actioned. They learn from their failures, refine their approach where necessary, remain resilient and continue to be focused on delivering actionable insights on issues that are the most important to the business. </p>, <p>The people analytics space is evolving rapidly in line with the fast-changing business and technology environments. Successful people analytics teams and leaders keep abreast of the opportunities these offer and adapt so that they can i) harness emerging data sources, ii) capitalise on technology that enables quicker and better data integration, analysis and visualisation, and; iii) underpin initiatives such as the consumerisation of HR, personalising the employee experience and democratising data. They are also cognisant of and actively participating in the debate that such trends have on areas like ethics, trust and privacy (see also #11). Look out for a future (pardon the pun) blog that will examine some of these emerging trends in more detail.</p>, <p>At the end of the day we mustn’t forget that people analytics is about people and that the insights it offers enables the business to make more informed decisions and derive better outcomes for the business – and employees. Practitioners such as <em><strong>Patrick Coolen</strong></em> (see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-factor-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a>) and <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/placidjover"" target=""_blank""><em>Placid Jover</em></a> (<a href=""http://www.etonbridgepartners.com/hr-analytics-fact-fad-or-the-future/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">see here</a>) remind us not to forget the human touch, and I concur that <strong>Data + Judgement = Problem-Solving</strong>. </p>, <p>Don’t be put off thinking that all of these ingredients need to be in place to get started with people analytics – they don’t. However, if you look to incorporate as many of the best practices above as you grow, I’m confident that you will create a successful, and sustainable practice – and provide significant benefit to your business and employees to boot.</p>, <p><em><strong>Books</strong></em>:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><em><strong>White papers and articles:</strong></em></p>, <p>IBM Smarter Workforce Institute - <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=LOL14045USEN"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Starting the Workforce Analytics Journey</a> (2015), <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=LOW14339USEN&amp;"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Decoding Workforce Analytics</a> (2016); Bersin by Deloitte – <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/Practice/Detail.aspx?id=20454"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Predictions for 2017: Everything is becoming digital</a> (2016); SHRM – <a href=""http://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/Data-Analysis-Skills.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jobs of the Future, Data Analysis Skills</a> (2016), <a href=""http://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/ShapingtheFuture/Documents/EIU%20Theme%203%20Analytics%20Report-FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Use of Workforce Analytics for Competitive Advantage</a> (2016), <a href=""http://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/products/Documents/2016%20Exec%20Summary-Final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Using Workforce Analytics for Competitive Advantage</a> - Conference Write-up (2016); New Talent Management Network - <a href=""http://www.talentstrategygroup.com/application/third_party/ckfinder/userfiles/files/NTMN%202016%20HR%20Anaytics%20Reports.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Still Under Construction: The State of HR Analytics 2016</a> (2016); Tracey Smith - <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/13-people-analytics-ideas-get-you-started-tracey-smith?trk=hp-feed-article-title-like"" target=""_blank"">13 People Analytics Ideas to get you Started</a> (2016); Luk Smeyers – <a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/hr-analytics-you-report-to-the-chro-period/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Analytics – You report to the CHRO</a> (HRN Blog, 2015); <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/starting-people-analytics-journey-needs-analysis-dont-luk-smeyers?trk=hp-feed-article-title-like"" target=""_blank"">Starting The People Analytics Journey With A Needs Analysis.

Green,"December 20, 2016",The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green/,"[<p>If the Christmas classic that is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HkJHApgKqw"" target=""_blank"">Stop the Cavalry</a> by Jona Lewie is playing on the radio, it must mean that 2016 is nearing its end. The year has simply flown by.</p>, <p>I’m in the fortunate position to have a unique view of the developing space of people analytics. 2016 has seen plenty of great work being done (see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-ii-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-more-people-analytics-case-studies-part-i-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), and interest levels in the subject have soared. Adoption levels are still lagging, with the rise in organisations embracing a data-driven approach to HR being steady rather than spectacular.</p>, <p>Selecting the best people analytics articles of the second half of 2016 has been a momentous task given both the quality and quantity of articles that are now being published. Even refining down to my favourite 40 has been a difficult and time-consuming process. As ever, I hope the collection proves an invaluable resource for colleagues working in the space and those interested in learning more. Enjoy and do let me know in the comments section, any articles I may have missed.</p>, <p>In no particular order…</p>, <p>One of the smartest HR leaders I’ve had the pleasure to come across, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/placidjover"" target=""_blank"">Placid Jover</a> was recently appointed to lead HR for Unilever’s £3 billion UK business. Previously, Placid had established and led Unilever’s global Organisation Performance and HR Analytics team. In this thoughtful article, Placid reflects on his experiences, how the space has evolved and what the future holds for analytics and how it will underpin HR. Placid's observations on the field are fascinating. This really is a must-read.</p>, <p>The evening before publishing, this tremendous article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a> of LinkedIn landed in my inbox causing me to make a last-minute change to the final 40. It recounts the story of how LinkedIn’s talent acquisition team couldn’t fill roles fast enough as the organisation grew by over 40% a year. Analytics were employed to build visibility and accountability into the hiring process. The results were astounding. The model that was built was able to predict within 5% actual numbers hired. Even more impressive is the fact that the intervention saved the company 15% of its recruiting budget in year one, which covered the cost of the investment in LinkedIn’s Talent Analytics team for more than 4 years. You see, this was simply too good to leave out! The Slideshare below, which was presented by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifershappley"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Shappley</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/phamchristopher"" target=""_blank"">Chris Pham</a> at Talent Connect, also covers this outstanding project. If case studies on people analytics are your thing see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-ii-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-more-people-analytics-case-studies-part-i-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The people analytics space is evolving quickly so it was definitely time for <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> to update his much-loved 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics. The result is the best version yet as not only has Patrick employed crowdsourcing techniques for what is v3.0, but he has also taken the time to highlight examples of the research he and his team have conducted at ABN AMRO. My favourite rule? That has to be a tie between #2 ‘Only do business relevant research’ and #3 ‘Create actionable insights’. Read more on the people analytics journey at ABN AMRO <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Whilst HR is “the new kid on the block” in the business when it comes to analytics this doesn't have to be an obstacle providing the function is prepared to leverage experiences from elsewhere in the organisation. In this perceptive article in the <a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">MIT Sloan Management Review</a>, the authors describe four lessons from customer analytics that can easily be applied to people analytics. This is a must-read for budding and experienced analytics practitioners alike.   </p>, <p>Bersin by Deloitte’s recent <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/business-talent-hr-predictions-2017-everything-becoming-josh-bersin"" target=""_blank"">2017 HR Predictions</a> is pretty bullish in its assertion that the next 12 months will see analytics move from a niche group in HR to an important operational business function (I certainly hope so!). This is borne out in this positive market analysis by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, Bersin’s People Analytics Research Leader. Madhura highlights three emerging trends in the space: i) the need for people analytics to add value to the business; ii) analytics as the new normal for HR; and iii) the critical role of technology. Look out for Bersin’s High-Impact People Analytics study, when it is published in 2017. </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: People Analytics maturity is growing (Source: Bersin by Deloitte, 2017 HR Predictions)</em></p>, <p>As I’ve toured the conference circuit in 2016, the issue of ethics and trust invariably crops up when the subject turns to people analytics. <a href=""http://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> believes that trust is the most important part of doing great people analytics, and I’m inclined to agree with him. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data. Not only does it affect the quality of data available, it also makes people analytics initiatives unsustainable. The Virtuous Circle of Data Quality (see Figure 2 below), conceptualised by Andrew, provides a convincing case for placing employee trust at the heart of any people analytics strategy.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: The Virtuous circle of data quality (Source: Andrew Marritt | Organization View)</em></p>, <p>In just a few short months, <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> has rapidly emerged as one of the premier resources for those working and interested in the people analytics space. Ticking both the quantity and quality boxes, there is a wealth of excellent proprietary and third party content to choose from. Choosing just one article was difficult, but I’ve plumped for this excellent piece by <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> on five reasons why HR Analytics projects fail. It’s an invaluable guide on the pitfalls to avoid for anyone working in a people analytics role, especially those just getting started – as is the recent book (<a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/ebook-basic-principles-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>The basic principles of People Analytics</em></a>) Erik and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/nandosteenhuis"" target=""_blank"">Nando Steenhuis</a> have published. I was so impressed that I happily agreed to write the foreword. </p>, <p>Failure, or more pertinently how to avoid it, is also the subject of this fabulous article by <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, one of the leading consultants and influencers in the field. The article is designed to help budding aspirants harness people analytics, and avoid project failure, by presenting a systematic, cost-effective methodology for creating robust data sets that correlate. It’s an eminently readable resource full of great advice and tips to avoid the many pitfalls that can befall even the pluckiest of novices. See Max speak at <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> in London on 25-26 April.</p>, <p>This article, which captures the main findings of the authors’ provocative <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1748-8583.12090/abstract"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">white paper</a>, asserts that the lack of progress with analytics is in part down to the lack of analytical understanding on the part of HR, whilst also apportioning blame to an industry touting expensive and complex products. The authors then offer some tips around developing an analytical mindset, focusing on the business, data governance and building the right skills and capabilities to conduct analytics. </p>, <p>Whilst acknowledging his own excitement about the role people analytics will play in transforming organisations, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation"" target=""_blank"">Andy Spence</a> correctly asserts that despite the hype adoption rates remain frustratingly low. He then describes seven challenges HR needs to overcome, as well as providing some astute advice to help practitioners succeed. Read the article alongside the accompanying Slideshare below. </p>, <p>Whilst I wrote this article, credit for the content has to go to <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> (and her co-authors <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a> and <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>), hence me being able to include it in this collection. During research for their upcoming book <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">“The Power of People: How Successful Organizations Use Workforce Analytics To Improve Business Performance”</a>, Dr. Feinzig and her co-authors found three categories of resistance that organisations need to overcome: i) stakeholder scepticism, ii) financial frugalness and iii) HR hesitancy. This article describes these three areas as well as providing recommendations as to how they can be overcome.  </p>, <p>Many organisations choose to get started with people analytics by conducting a needs analysis with their HR colleagues. In this indispensible article, <a href=""http://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> of <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a> questions this approach and instead offers his own guide for CHROs looking to get started. I particularly like Luk’s suggestion that the people analytics function should be the right-hand ‘intelligence service’ of the CHRO - data driven HR indeed.</p>, <p>Those looking to make a case for investing in people analytics in their organisations would do well to utilise the evidence presented here by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a>. The article highlights research by Sierra-Cedar demonstrating organisations with workforce analytics and data-driven decision making outperform those that don’t. The four characteristics of these “quantified” organisations are then outlined. Compelling stuff!</p>, <p>The glacial pace of progress in people analytics is perhaps not surprising since HR is trying to remake itself in an entirely new image, in an environment where supply of new analytical talent—and budget to hire them—is extremely limited. This article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a> (also a <a href=""http://twitter.com/EvanSinar"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">must-follow on Twitter</a>) and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/richwellins"" target=""_blank"">Rich Wellins</a> describes the skills and traits HR needs, how well (or not) the function is prepared (see Figure 3 below) and the relationships in the business that can best help propel HR forward. </p>, <p><em>Figure 3: What HR needs to thrive with Analytics (Source: DDI)</em></p>, <p>The field of people analytics has attracted many bright young things that otherwise probably wouldn’t have considered a career in HR. <a href=""http://de.linkedin.com/in/stefan-hierl-1488932"" target=""_blank"">Stefan Hierl</a>, who leads people analytics at Adidas is one such example. This article in the superb <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside HR</a> describes the three core pillars of Adidas’ people analytics strategy: i) align with the business to define what success looks like, ii) use data and insights to improve the employee experience, and iii) support broader strategic decision-making. </p>, <p>As <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, Head of Global Workforce Analytics at Experian, testifies in this article, many organisations are still swimming in the slow lane when it comes to workforce analytics. As he goes on to state, it doesn’t have to be a struggle, and this is even less likely to be the case if organisations and nascent analytics leaders follow the excellent advice in this article. Effective stakeholder management, building a balanced team and prioritising education and awareness are just three of the tips provided.</p>, <p>Having a CHRO who not only sponsors but is involved in the people analytics initiative is a common factor I have seen in organisations that are successful in this space. One such CHRO is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-herena-b55464a4"" target=""_blank"">Monique Herena</a> of BNY Mellon. In this article, she outlines the guiding principles she has followed to establish people analytics capability at the bank. </p>, <p>Another CHRO who has written about their organisation’s people analytics journey is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a>. This article describes how Microsoft is using analytics to help employees and teams to become more productive. More importantly, it also tackles the question of employee trust. Hogan emphasises that the purpose is to empower rather than undermine employee decision-making and articulates her vision of creating the ability for employees to own their data, improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance. Read more on Microsoft’s people analytics journey with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The second entry from the excellent <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside HR</a> comes from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/christadegnan"" target=""_blank"">Christa Degnan Manning</a> of <a href=""http://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin by Deloitte</a>. It describes four emerging trends that are increasingly shaping the field of people analytics. The main trend featured is how companies are using previously untapped sources of data (e.g. social media, biometrics, wearables) to derive insights to help tackle pressing people challenges. The other trends featured are: i) tools to support more frequent and real-time measurement; ii) integration of data from disparate sources; and iii) easier, faster analytics and visualisation of data. Speaking of which…</p>, <p>Sentiment analysis has long been used by organisations to better understand its customers and, as this piece in The Atlantic reports, is now increasingly being used by forward-thinking organisations to get invaluable insights on their employees. The article provides two excellent examples from Twitter and IBM – indeed the latter used an internally developed sentiment-analysis tool called Social Pulse to engage its employees in a revamp of its performance-review system. </p>, <p>Do algorithms completely eliminate bias and prejudice from hiring? Of course not and indeed, as described by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/gideon-mann-223a2912"" target=""_blank"">Gideon Mann</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cathy O’Neil</a> in this HBR piece, left to their own devices algorithms can even exacerbate bias - humans make them after all. The article examines this challenge and advocates the continual audit and modification of algorithms to limit inequity. As algorithms take on a larger role, HR professionals will do well to heed the advice offered here.</p>, <p>How do you engage HRBPs and make them “consumers of analytics”? This was the weighty challenge set for the first Human Capital Analytics hackathon held by Copenhagen Business School. The solutions are nicely summarised in this article by <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/saskia-menke-788b9ba0/en"" target=""_blank"">Saskia Menke</a>. It is certainly an important challenge for organisations if they are to scale analytics and create a sustainable capability across HR, so the findings make for interesting reading. </p>, <p>We read a lot about <a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/demystifying-people-analytics-part-3-the-power-of-storytelling/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">storytelling in people analytics</a>, which as <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> acknowledges in this article is one of the core requisites for success in this field. However, as Andersen goes on to argue, storytelling on its own can actually be harmful if you do not have a plausible and well-documented theory behind your data. Certainly, the example he provides in the article on leadership effectiveness by gender presents a convincing case.</p>, <p>Many organisations decide to build a Centre of Excellence (CoE) as part of its attempt to develop people analytics capability. In this piece, <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/manojkumarhranalytics"" target=""_blank"">Manoj Kumar</a>, who led HSBC’s HR Analytics CoE for five years, outlines five reasons why a CoE may not deliver ROI within expected timelines whilst also suggesting fixes to each of these challenges. I can also highly recommend Manoj’s <a href=""http://talkinghranalytics.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talking HR Analytics</a> blog as an excellent resource for those working or interested in the field. </p>, <p>A key outcome of many people analytics projects is that the insights are counterintuitive to the common wisdom of many HR (and business) leaders. This article in the McKinsey Quarterly provides three such case studies in the areas of sourcing, screening and attrition. The last example in particular resonates where the finding that employees in smaller teams, with longer periods between promotions and with lower-performing managers, were more likely to leave led to a far more tailored and focused approach.</p>, <p>Another practitioner article comes from <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/sidshishoo"" target=""_blank"">Sidhartha Shishoo</a> of Genpact on the excellent <a href=""http://www.peoplematters.in/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Matters</a> site. The article describes some of the challenges Genpact faced when embarking on its people analytics journey including i) separating analytics from reporting, ii) data quality, iii) building capability and iv) employee privacy. It’s an outstanding article and one that emphasises the need for boldness: in thinking, in strategy and in application when it comes to people analytics.</p>, <p><a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> makes a couple of points in this article that really resonate. When it comes to people analytics i) the sense of urgency is missing in too many organisations, and ii) instead of talking about it, just get started. Tom then outlines five steps to getting started.</p>, <p>Being a mathematician, prolific writer and consultant <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> tables 13 (it’s a prime!) ideas for the budding people analytics aspirant to get started. Together, these cover the whole gamut of people operations from recruiting through to engagement, performance and retention – all with the emphasis on providing business value. Plenty to inspire here.</p>, <p><a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> trains HR practitioners through his ‘Practical People Analytics’ course (and very good it is too, by all accounts). This article describes some of the lessons this experience has taught him such as the need to i) differentiate between reporting and analytics, ii) embrace rather than eschew traditional HR intuition and iii) collaborate and share. Read the article for further insights.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/beneubanks"" target=""_blank"">Ben Eubanks</a> (check out his <a href=""http://upstarthr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Upstart HR blog</a>) is one of the best of the new breed of HR analysts, so it is good to read that he believes the subject of analytics is getting serious traction amongst leaders. Similar to the article above by Sam Hill, Eubanks recognises that HR sometimes struggles to differentiate between the different types of analytics, so this definition of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive should prove a helpful resource for many.</p>, <p>Google is the poster organisation for people analytics and there have been countless articles written about their phenomenal success in this space. These two rank amongst the best. First, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/stgmaier/en"" target=""_blank"">Steffen Meier</a> describes Google’s data-driven approach and use of employee feedback to optimise its people processes and culture. He also summarises Project Oxygen (on leadership) and Project Aristotle (on team effectiveness). The New York Times article provides a fascinating and detailed description of Aristotle, which is an essential read. </p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The five key factors of team effectiveness at Google (Source: re:Work, Project Aristotle)</em></p>, <p>Google is also featured in hiQ Labs head honcho <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal"" target=""_blank"">Darren Kaplan</a>’s tribute to its former HR head <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a>, who announced he was stepping down from his role at the tech giant earlier this year. As Kaplan rightly asserts, Bock is one of the (if not ‘the’) most influential figures in people analytics and data driven HR and all of us in the space have a lot to be grateful to him for. Some of Kaplan’s colleagues at hiQ also deserve a mention and I also highly recommend reading these three articles: i) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhousman"" target=""_blank"">Michael Housman</a> reports on the recent hiQ Elevate awards as well as providing an astute analysis of the space, ii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/teuschb"" target=""_blank"">Ben Teusch</a> makes a plea for more articles at the ‘micro level’, which offer explanations of which kinds of analyses are useful for people analytics, and; iii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-a-hammond"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Hammond</a> on the opportunity and challenge of the cognitive funnel in people analytics. Quite a quartet of articles there. </p>, <p>One of the most interesting HR Tech firms I’ve come across is <a href=""http://www.saberr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Saberr</a>, who focus on making teams work well together. They’ve also employed research methods to understand how values operate at different levels of the organisation (individual, team and organisation). CEO <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/tom-marsden-b04282"" target=""_blank"">Tom Marsden</a> details the methodology and findings from the research in this engrossing article. </p>, <p><em>Figure 5: How values impact organisations (Source: Saberr)</em></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/burkepowers"" target=""_blank"">Burke Powers</a>, who leads people data, reporting and analytics at PayPal, is an advocate of design thinking to get greater understanding and adoption when tackling any analytics project. In this excellent article, Burke outlines his theory and uses eight case study examples from the likes of Google, KPMG and Microsoft as evidence of the benefits of placing design thinking at the heart of an analytics project. </p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>’s Future of Work podcast is always worth a listen and this is certainly the case when it comes to this episode featuring <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a>, CEO of <a href=""http://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a>, a social sensing and analytics platform that uses sensors in employee ID badges to drive team effectiveness and engagement. Waber offers some fascinating observations on the people analytics space, not least i) start small, but do something that makes you uncomfortable and outside of your comfort zone, ii) if you don’t start people analytics in the next two years it will be hard to catch up with those that have, and iii) on average people analytics increases top line performance by 10-15%.</p>, <p>One of the reasons tabled by HR for being unable to get started with people analytics is data quality (or the lack of it). There’s no doubt that you need to be able to justify your data when challenged, but at the same time the desire for the nirvana of 100% clean data is wholly unrealistic. This outstanding article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-kennedy-a936283"" target=""_blank"">Cameron Kennedy</a> guides the would-be analyst through some of the pitfalls and offers plenty of practical tips on collecting, cleaning and analysing data. </p>, <p>A regular entrant in my collection of the best articles on people analytics is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-roberts-b0217"" target=""_blank"">Greta Roberts</a>. In this short and sweet piece, Greta makes a simple but important observation on how HR is often misaligned to the business because it doesn’t measure the same goals. In analytics, we teach the importance of focusing on the business first and foremost, so perhaps it is in adopting people analytics that HR can find its way out of the morass Greta highlights.</p>, <p>If people analytics is to become a core part of HR’s repertoire and underpin the function of the future, the teaching of HR has to have a heavy emphasis on data, science and analytics within its curricula. It is good therefore to see articles like this by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-burris-2007751"" target=""_blank"">Ethan Burris</a> on the <a href=""http://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work blog</a>, which describes how the writer has developed a course that instructs the use of data over intuition in decision-making on people. I’m sure the likes of the CIPD and SHRM are also heading down this road.</p>, <p>In this five-part series (see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-analytics-hr-our-crystal-ball-says-scott-mondore?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-analytics-hr-our-crystal-ball-says-scott-mondore-1?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-analytics-hr-our-crystal-ball-says-scott-mondore-2?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-analytics-hr-our-crystal-ball-says-scott-mondore-3?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/predictive-analytics-hr-our-crystal-ball-says-scott-mondore-4?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-mondore-1b226b2"" target=""_blank"">Scott Mondore</a> looks into his crystal ball and provides five predictions (with added evidence) regarding analytics in HR.

Ten more case studies follow here. Collectively, they will hopefully provide some inspiration and learning to those looking to embark on their own journeys in this burgeoning area of HR.</p>, <p>From speaking to practitioners, I know that they crave stories and learning from others, so do please let me know of any other case studies that I can feature in further articles like this.</p>, <p>One of the most inspirational conversations I’ve had recently was with <a href=""http://de.linkedin.com/in/stefan-hierl-1488932"" target=""_blank"">Stefan Hierl</a>, Senior Manager of People Analytics at Adidas. We discussed the future of employee experience and people analytics and how they were fundamental to the new HR strategy at Adidas. Some of this discussion features in <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/3-keys-adidas-people-analytics-strategy/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>this great interview</strong></a> with Stefan by Inside HR. The article describes the three core pillars of Adidas’ people analytics strategy: i) align with the business to define what success looks like, ii) use data and insights to improve the employee experience, and iii) support broader strategic decision-making. I’d also recommend reading this article with Stefan in conjunction with the Future of Work Podcast (see below) featuring <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-parkin-6a19517"" target=""_blank"">Karen Parkin</a>, CHRO at Adidas, and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>. Together they demonstrate a perfect alignment between business, HR and people analytics strategy.</p>, <p><em>Source: Future of Work Podcast: Karen Parkin &amp; Jacob Morgan</em></p>, <p>In <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a>, I featured a great Case Study from Microsoft from the superb <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valuing your Talent</a> site. This time, I wanted to highlight <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/empower-your-employees-leverage-own-data-kathleen-hogan?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank""><strong>this excellent article</strong></a> by Microsoft CHRO <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a>. In my view it is important for a number of reasons: i) having a CHRO who not only sponsors but is deeply involved in the work is a key trend I have seen in successful people analytics initiatives, ii) the focus on employee productivity is arguably the Holy Grail that people analytics can help unlock for organisations, iii) the drive to personalise data and put it in the hands of the employee so they can use it to enhance their career and performance is paramount to imbue employee trust and thus secure the future of people analytics. As <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">my interview</a> with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, Head of People Analytics, describes, Microsoft has been doing analytics on people data for 13 years and is one of the organisations pushing the boundaries of what is possible. The Case Study referenced earlier from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a> should be read in conjunction with Kathleen’s article as well as the video below of Kathleen being interviewed as part of a panel at the <a href=""http://www.peopleanalyticsconference.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wharton People Analytics Conference</a> in 2016.</p>, <p><em>Source: Wharton People Analytics Conference</em></p>, <p>Anyone with interest in People Analytics and data-driven HR should subscribe to <a href=""http://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Google’s re:Work site</a>, which is a wonderful resource for case studies and best practice. <a href=""http://rework.withgoogle.com/case-studies/riot-games-assessing-toxicity/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>This Case Study</strong></a> from Riot Games is an excellent example of innovative research, incisive analysis and business focused outcomes. League of Legends is one of the world’s most popular computer games with 30 million players. There are many parallels between the game and the workplace with team dynamics, sportsmanship, and camaraderie all key to giving League players a fun experience. Toxic behaviour, on the other hand, has a detrimental effect on both the playing and working experience. All ‘Rioters’ (Riot’s employees) play the game and have a behavioural profile. Riot’s Talent team hypothesised that in-game behaviour by Rioters would correlate with their behaviour at work and found that 25% of employees who had been let go in the previous year were players with unusually high in-game toxicity. Turning to current employees, the team identified the 30 most toxic employees and worked with them to help them reconsider their behaviour, in-game and beyond – there’s a great quote from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jaycms"" target=""_blank"">Jay Moldenhauer-Salazar</a>, Riot’s Head of Talent on the horror some of these employees felt when confronted with their in-game behaviour. Riot has now adopted in-game behaviour into the hiring process and is also working with MIT to look at how the research can be used to create high-performing teams.</p>, <p><em>Source: re:Work, Riot Games Case Study</em></p>, <p>In <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a>, I featured Nielsen’s winning entry from the <a href=""http://www.workforceanalyticsawards.com/newyork"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Workforce Analytics Excellence Awards</a> in 2016 and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3S1bUhK3Fo"" target=""_blank"">this fabulous example of how to tell a story with data</a>. Building a people analytics team and capability typically involves breaking a number of myths and that has certainly been the case for <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/piyushmathur"" target=""_blank"">Piyush Mathur</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dougshagam"" target=""_blank"">Doug Shagam</a> and the intrepid team at Nielsen. In <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/linkedin-talent-solutions/people-analytics-breaking-myths-with-agility-and-passion-talent-connect-2016"" target=""_blank""><strong>this great Slideshare</strong></a> from their LinkedIn Talent Connect presentation, Piyush and Doug demonstrate how they shattered myths such as “I’m not sure where to begin”, “Our data isn’t good enough to work with” and “I don’t have the resources to do people analytics”. Nielsen is in the early stages of their journey with people analytics, but they have already taken some significant steps and achieved substantial business impact. Those looking to get started would do well to take inspiration from Piyush and Doug. Indeed, a detailed case study from Nielsen features in the much awaited and upcoming ‘<em>The Power of People: How Successful Organizations Use Workforce Analytics to Improve Business Performance</em>’ book from Jonathan Ferrar, Nigel Guenole and Sheri Feinzig, which <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">you can order here</a>.</p>, <p>Another re:Work themed entry comes from a presentation Major Paul Lester of the US Army gave at the re:Work conference in November 2014. The 11 minute video (see <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WC4ot8z584"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and below) is a must-see and outlines how the US Army uses data to improve the lives of its soldiers. The cost of attrition during basic training is $400m-$600m per annum, so the Army has run analysis on the factors that lead to churn and has determined the importance of resilience. The video goes on to describe i) findings linking poor resilience assessment scores with higher healthcare utilisation, and ii) low emotional assessment scores with increased likelihood of experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder on combat missions. This is powerful stuff and proof that not only can people analytics improve both business and employee outcomes it can, in certain environments, literally save lives. </p>, <p>Like Microsoft and Nielsen, Cisco also featured in <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a> of my original series of case studies. <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> is doing some wonderful work at the tech giant and I had the pleasure of interviewing him for the Tucana People Analytics Podcast (<a href=""http://tucana-global.com/2016/11/04/people-analytics-cisco-ian-bailie/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>see here</strong></a><strong> </strong>and below).</p>, <p>Our discussion touched on a number of areas but look out for i) how Ian has built analytics capability at Cisco, ii) how analytics supports talent acquisition and people planning, and iii) the great work Ian and his team are doing to benefit the business and employees with the Cisco Talent Cloud. More on the people analytics journey at Cisco can be viewed on the Slideshare below from Ian’s presentation at the HR Tech World Congress in Paris from October 2016.</p>, <p>In <a href=""http://thefutureorganization.com/metrics-hr-works-enterprise-analytics-drive-strategy-business/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this revealing interview</a> with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a> on the Future of Work Podcast, Jennie Carlson, CHRO at US Bancorp, describes the people analytics journey at the fifth largest bank in the US. Carlson explains why the HR Analytics team was moved from HR into Strategy to join the Customer Analytics team. Reasons included enhanced career paths, better tools, a more sophisticated approach, a desire to apply techniques to derive insights on the customer experience to employees and a shift in focus from HR to the business. As people analytics continues to mature, more organisations will likely shift to enterprise wide analytics teams. Carlson outlines the many benefits the relocation of the team has enabled. Critically, the insights the team provides around employee trend analysis has empowered her HRBPs and improved the service delivered to the business. This is mandatory listening for any CHRO thinking of stepping up their HR team’s people analytics efforts.</p>, <p>People Analytics projects don’t always have to be complex in order to have significant business impact as <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/article/hr-analytics-spoils-leave-party-at-nab/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>this example</strong></a> from National Australia Bank (NAB) shows. Former NAB people and culture head of consulting, <a href=""http://au.linkedin.com/in/stuart-moseley-5075275"" target=""_blank"">Stuart Moseley</a> and his analytics team found that on average, the bank's workers were taking 18 annual leave days out of 20 every year. The team calculated that this translated to AU$20 million per annum. Further analysis found that the less annual leave an employee took, the more sick leave they were having. Translating the liability to a financial amount ensured the attention of senior management and support for the initiative to push workers to take 105% of their leave entitlement. What I like about this project is not only did the bank achieve the business outcomes they desired (reducing cost) but employees also benefited in terms of having more leave and therefore being more rested.  </p>, <p>My travels over the past year have taught me that people analytics is a global phenomenon, so I was delighted to come across <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/cheetung/2016/10/16/one-of-asias-leading-hr-execs-discusses-how-big-data-can-help-you-hire-smarter/?utm_content=bufferf580a#5f62120960cf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>this excellent interview</strong></a> with Cynthia Tan, ex-CHRO of OCBC Bank by <a href=""http://sg.linkedin.com/in/cheetung"" target=""_blank"">CheeTung Leong</a>. In it Tan describes how she introduced people analytics into the bank, which has 30,000 employees globally, as early as 2013 when a large number of HR professionals were certified in analytics. Tan also talks about some of the challenges OCBC faced – many of which will be familiar to those who have also embarked on this journey – including the fact that statistics and maths are not natural bedfellows for HR professionals and that the desire to build capability quickly means consultants are a tempting option. Three takeaways from the article that may help others are: i) you can kickstart your journey by borrowing expertise from outside HR – the customer analytics team in this case, ii) don’t wait to invest in analytics – do it now to improve your ability to attract, retain and develop staff – otherwise you risk losing competitive advantage to your competitors, and iii) as the maturity of people analytics grows so the role of the HR function will evolve so that people decisions will always be informed by data and analytics. Like the Microsoft and US Bancorp cases this is yet another example of the importance of having a CHRO who not only sponsors people analytics initiatives but is passionate about the work and heavily involved.</p>, <p>One of the oldest and most widely known people analytics cases comes from HP, who has been applying a flight risk score to its 300,000+ employees since 2011. <a href=""http://analytics-magazine.org/predictive-analytics-the-privacy-pickle-hewlett-packards-prediction-of-employee-behavior/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">This seminal article</a> by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/predictiveanalytics"" target=""_blank"">Eric Siegel</a> describes how the project was conceived together with the sensitivity applied in terms of who within the organisation has visibility on the employees predicted to leave. Predicting attrition is typically one of the first projects tackled by a new people analytics team. This is not surprising given i) attrition is a challenge faced by the majority of organisations, and ii) the cost of attrition can be high. Siegel’s article estimates that HP was set to save $300m that otherwise would have been lost to lower productivity and replacing leavers. That is a number guaranteed to get any business leader to sit up and take notice.</p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><strong><em>David</em></strong><em> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

David R. Green,"December 7, 2016",40 People Analytics Case Studies - Part 3,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-more-people-analytics-case-studies-part-i-david-green/,"[<p>Earlier this year I published two articles collecting 20 case studies on people analytics (see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?published=t"" target=""_blank"">Part 2</a>). The response has been overwhelmingly positive, for which I am most grateful, and the clear, underlying sentiment seems, to paraphrase Oliver Twist, to be ‘<em>please sir, can I have some more</em>’.</p>, <p>So, the series has now been extended to Part 3 and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-ii-david-green?published=t"" target=""_blank"">Part 4</a>, comprising another 20 case studies. These are from organisations that have realised the many business and employee benefits inherent in investing in people analytics.</p>, <p>One of my favourite white papers published on people analytics was written by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a>, now GM People Analytics, Insights &amp; Experience at National Australia Bank. The white paper, which you can <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090261615000443"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>download here</strong></a>, provides a critique of the HR centric approach adopted by the majority of organisations when it comes to analytics and instead advocates an “outside-in” method targeted at solving real business problems. Two excellent examples from Maersk Drilling are highlighted to support the argument. <u>Case 1</u> (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below) examines the impact of leadership quality and crew competence on safety, operational performance, and customer satisfaction with the case predicated on answering three questions from top management: (1) What explains variance in performance between rigs? (2) How can that knowledge effectively be deployed to new rigs brought into operation? And; (3) How can the results be used to help convince prospective clients that the company will deliver on promised performance standards while growing considerably in a hot market? <u>Case 2</u> examined the ROI and Strategic Impact of a Technical Trainee Acceleration Program and subsequently led into a strategic workforce planning discussion (build/buy/borrow). As you will see, both cases emphasise that analytics is far more effective when tackled from a business (rather than an inward looking HR) perspective and that analytics should be treated as a change management process.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: HR analytics in Maersk Drilling. Percentages shown are the squared correlations, i.e., amount of variance explained. Often HR Analytics teams will only link leadership quality and turnover (box 3), while a broad analytics approach looks at the entire value chain</em> <em> (Source: Maersk Drilling use case featured in Learning from practice: how HR analytics avoids being a management fad - Ulrich &amp; Rasmussen)</em></p>, <p>People analytics projects invariably dispel myths within organisations and that was certainly the case with the research conducted by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-grant-205b245"" target=""_blank"">Doug Grant</a> and his team into the comparative performance of university and experienced hires at Johnson &amp; Johnson. As described in <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2015/06/05/johnson-johnson-goes-back-to-campus-for-new-hires/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>this article</strong></a> in the Wall Street Journal, recruiters had scaled back on college hiring for certain functional areas including HR and IT believing that experienced hires would contribute quicker and stay longer. Grant and his team decided to test this hunch out, gathered data on 47,000 employees and compared performance, likelihood of promotion and attrition levels. The data revealed that whilst performance between the two groups was similar, university hires were less likely to leave and more likely to be promoted. As such, the previous decision to focus on experienced hires was reversed and Johnson &amp; Johnson has ramped up its efforts on college hiring. For more insights on the analytics journey at the company, have a look at the interview below with CHRO Peter Fasolo at the Wharton People Analytics Conference in 2015.</p>, <p>Google’s <a href=""http://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work</a> site is a marvellous resource when it comes to best practice and case studies on data-driven and people-centric HR. One example describes how Wegmans Food Markets (<a href=""http://rework.withgoogle.com/case-studies/Wegmans-conjoint-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>see here</strong></a>) sought to tackle the challenge of escalating healthcare costs as the organisation scaled rapidly. Rather than arbitrarily changing the employee benefits package (and reducing costs), Wegmans wanted to understand how employees comparatively valued these benefits so employee satisfaction could also be improved. By using a conjoint analysis, Wegmans found that health benefits were a deciding factor as to whether employees joined and also stayed at the organisation. Indeed, the analysis found that offering even basic healthcare coverage to employees who were not currently eligible would drive significant incremental value due to how highly employees regarded healthcare benefits. The results of the analysis showed that a $107 investment per non-eligible employee would cost $1.5 million but would feel like $32.5 million to the employees. Accordingly, Wegmans was able to control costs without reducing employee satisfaction.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Summary of Wegmans People Analytics Case Study (Source re:Work by Google)</em></p>, <p>One of the most impressive stories I’ve heard on building organisational capability in people analytics comes from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a> during his time at Chevron. Building a people analytics team is a challenge, but to sustain and scale it across a global organisation of 58,000 employees in 60 countries is infinitely more difficult. <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/Practice/Detail.aspx?id=20290"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>This detailed Bersin by Deloitte Case Study</strong></a> walks the reader through the two-year journey at Chevron. It describes how Chevron tackled its challenge to scale, unify and grow analytics capabilities globally across the company, making it an essential skill for all HR professionals and ultimately turn people analytics into a competitive advantage. Chevron needed to switch focus on analytics from HR to the business and took the following steps to achieve this: i) implementing a vision and mission statement to help create an identity, ii) consistently reviewing the metrics that are tracked to check for continued business relevance, and iii) creating a prioritisation mechanism for all analytics projects (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below). Building organisational capability centred on two main strategies: i) launching a Community of Practice, which as of September 2016 comprised 300 members spread across 22 business units and 18 countries, and; ii) building a three-stage in-house analytics curriculum that serves to create a structured learning and development program in analytics. This multi-pronged approach has helped create a vast and virtual people analytics team and effectively changed the way HR and the business thinks. With this firm foundation in place, Chevron is well-positioned to derive the competitive advantage it seeks from its investment in people analytics.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Chevron's four-box grid for prioritising people analytics projects (Source Chevron / Bersin by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p>More has been written about Google’s successes with people analytics than any other organisation. I touched on some of these in <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a>, but wanted to highlight one more case this time. The re:Work site has a fantastic <a href=""http://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>description of Project Aristotle</strong></a> (as does <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?smid=pl-share"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>this New York Times article</strong></a> – I’d recommend reading both), which sought to understand ‘What makes a team effective at Google?’. One of the possible outcomes of a people analytics project (or experiment) is that no significant insights are found. This was initially the case with Project Aristotle - two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. As <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/abeerdubey"" target=""_blank"">Abeer Dubey</a>, part of Google’s fabled People Analytics team and a leader on the project explained “<em>at Google, we’re good at finding patterns, but there weren’t strong patterns here</em>”. Despite this setback the team persevered and eventually found that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together, arriving at the five key factors in <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> below.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The five key factors of team effectiveness at Google (Source: re:Work, Project Aristotle)</em></p>, <p>This video on Project Aristotle featuring Dubey and fellow project lead <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-rozovsky-642a683"" target=""_blank"">Julia Rozovsky</a> is also compulsory viewing.</p>, <p>In <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?published=t"" target=""_blank"">Part 2</a>, I highlighted two case studies from the excellent <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valuing your Talent</a> site by Coca-Cola Enterprises and Unilever. This time, it is the turn of Capgemini and a case study (<a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/research-resources/case-studies/capgemini"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>see here</strong></a>) penned by <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/majabrykczynska"" target=""_blank"">Maja Luckos</a>, Head of People Analytics. It is a detailed description of how the organisation moved from static reporting focused on silos and the past to the creation of a tool that now offers access to key human capital data and insights in one place. What I enjoyed most about the Case Study was i) the step-by step description of first winning the hearts and minds of the HR Leadership team, then the setting up definitions before the tool was actually built, ii) how the process has effectively raised not only confidence levels in the business of HR but also of HR in itself and is allowing them to connect people analytics with business issues, and; iii) how Capgemini is now seeking to turn the tool into a commercial product. HR as a profit centre? You’d better believe it! Maja is to be congratulated on her ingenuity, determination and success.</p>, <p>Credit Suisse calculated that a one-point reduction in regretted attrition saves the bank $75 million to $100 million a year – that’s a number guaranteed to get attention from top management. <a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-algorithm-that-tells-the-boss-who-might-quit-1426287935"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>This article</strong></a> in the Wall Street Journal describes how three years of analysis at the bank highlighted the importance of internal mobility in making employees more ‘sticky’. This insight saw recruiters increase the number of roles posted internally to 80% (from less than half) and recruiters using attrition probability scores to actively call employees to discuss a change of role. The article goes on to describe a project Credit Suisse undertook to investigate why women with certain job titles left the company at higher rates than men. Moreover, examples from Micron, Box, Walmart and AOL are also touched upon in the article. You can read more about the attrition project at Credit Suisse in <a href=""http://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/pages/0712fox2.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this SHRM article</a> and further information on the people analytics journey initiated by <a href=""http://www.santanderus.com/us/about-us/management/williamwolf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">William Wolf</a> (now CHRO at Santander US) at the bank <a href=""http://www.credit-suisse.com/us/en/articles/articles/news-and-expertise/2014/08/en/how-big-data-can-improve-people-practices.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>This <a href=""http://www.hrdive.com/news/people-analytics-at-ey/427665/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>interview on HR Dive</strong></a> with <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/blair-hopkins-531429a"" target=""_blank"">Blair Hopkins</a>, Director of Global People Data, Reporting &amp; Analytics gives an impressive overview of the analytics journey at EY. The article describes some of the challenges faced, which include the need to work with HR leaders in 155 countries, securing budget for people and technology, imbuing analytical skills in HR professionals and the need to prioritise projects. These are challenges I see many large organisations experiencing as their people analytics journeys unfold. Nevertheless, the article also touches on some of the successes: i) the team made employee retention relevant to the business by converting retention rate to a dollar value, ii) significant progress has been made in the area of engagement, and; iii) insights have been provided in the areas of diversity and inclusion, recruitment, development, learning and performance management.</p>, <p><a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/eddie-ahmed-728a6417"" target=""_blank"">Eddie Ahmed</a>, CHRO of Mass Mutual, has a clear definition of the three things he believes defines the HR function: i) help the business achieve better than average returns, ii) build leadership capabilities that are aligned with company strategy, and iii) run HR as a business focused on operational efficiency and using tools to enable better decision making. Naturally, People Analytics is pivotal to realising these goals and in <a href=""http://web.hiqlabs.com/podcast/2016/9/19/episode-008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this <strong>brilliant podcast</strong></a> with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhousman"" target=""_blank"">Michael Housman</a> of hiQ Labs, Ahmed describes the people analytics journey at Mass Mutual so far and his current focus areas of retention, productivity and employee wellness. It’s certainly an inspirational listen and I’ll be watching the story unfurl with interest.</p>, <p>Like Google, Shell also featured in <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a> but I had to find a space for this case, which I saw presented at the HR Tech World Congress in Paris in October 2016. As it is for many large global organisations, cyber security incidents are a clear and present challenge for Shell. The People Analytics team sought to analyse what are the people characteristics that can accurately predict a cyber security incident. Slides 6 and 7 in the Slideshare below summarise the main findings: i) phishing incidents drop in line with the first five years tenure before increasing, ii) in contrast the tendency to download a virus increases with tenure over the first five years before dropping off, and iii) correlations were also found with Skill and Assignment types. This enabled the team to create an algorithm that meant Shell could target only the employees most likely to breach cyber security with awareness campaigns and still reduce the number of actual incidents that would occur. Slide 13 is incomplete, but by only targeting 57% of employees with the cyber security awareness campaign (the 47% shown plus an additional 10%), Shell reduced the employee population that was likely to invoke an incident from 47% to 16%. The project delivered cost savings through the targeted awareness campaign, lower risk and improved employee productivity.

David R. Green,"October 24, 2016",The HR Analytics journey at Shell,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-journey-shell-david-green/,"[<p>During the countdown to the <a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech World Congress</a> in Paris this week, I’ve been interviewing some of the great speakers I’ll be moderating on the Smart Data track at the show.</p>, <p>So far, I’ve published fascinating interviews with <em><strong>Dawn Klinghoffer</strong></em> (<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>see here</em></a>) and <em><strong>Patrick Coolen</strong></em> (<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">see here</a>) who regaled the people analytics journeys respectively at Microsoft and ABN AMRO. Crucially, given the large number of organisations still to develop capability in this area, Dawn and Patrick also offered plenty of tips on how to get started with people analytics.</p>, <p>Today, it’s the turn of <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a"" target=""_blank""><strong>Esther Bongenaar</strong></a> and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/vgiagkoulas"" target=""_blank""><strong>Vasilis Giagkoulas</strong></a> of <strong>Shell</strong>’s HR Analytics team. Like Microsoft and ABN AMRO, Shell has forged a deserved reputation as one of the leading organisations globally when it comes to people analytics. </p>, <p>In our discussion, Esther, Vasilis and I discussed the HR analytics journey at Shell and also some of the elements you need to have in place to be successful in this discipline, and, crucially, provide positive outcomes for your business. </p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: Hi David, I am the Manager of Shell’s HR Analytics team. I have been doing this for almost three years now and have enjoyed it immensely. I had other roles in Shell before, all highly analytical; now I focus on building and leading the team. The move to HR was unusual but the opportunity to make an impact pulled me to HR.</p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: Hi David, I am an HR Analytics Analyst in the HR Analytics team at Shell. I started at Shell two years ago and I got into this role as I was inspired that by applying mathematics/statistics you could solve People problems. I have an engineering background and I bring experience from my time in marketing intelligence as an analytical consultant and also from the industry as an energy leader. My role is divided in 3 parts: </p>, <p><em>Vasilis Giagkoulas and Esther Bongenaar from Shell's HR Analytics team</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: HR Analytics to me is the opportunity to make an impact to the decision-making around people using data and sophisticated methods to unlock hidden insights. As an engineer, the ability to apply mathematics to change people’s working lives for the better is powerful. HR is changing, it is moving towards a more analytical, evidence-based approach and the fact that I am part of it, fascinates me! </p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: We are indeed supporting a transition towards a better balance between intuition, beliefs, experience and then evidence. Our mission is to gain a better understanding of the drivers of employee performance and their impact on business results.  Analytics as we define it is limited to advanced and predictive analytics. But there are many others in the organization on the same mission; they support the transition with management reporting, high-quality employee surveys etc.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: Shell's HR Analytics team supports a better balance between intuition, beliefs and experience on one side and then evidence on the other</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: You need analytical skills for analytics, and then every project needs to start with a business question, preferably something that has direct and significant bottom-line impact. That assures attention, relevant results and the right level of support (for instance to acquire access to data).</p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: The discussion around the level of analytical skills and the HR understanding that an HR analytics team should possess is crucial to set the solid foundations of a successful team. However, the main thing that everyone should consider when starting with HR Analytics is to secure senior management sponsorship and commitment. To be able to bring change to the decision-making process of the organization, you need to have convincing ambassadors and leaders committed to the new way of thinking and willing to promote the work that has been done. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: Again, there are different ways to deliver evidence based content to the HR organization. In the Shell HR Analytics team we now combine skills on: </p>, <p>We work closely together with the HR Management Information (HR reporting) and Diagnostics team (operations around employee surveys and assessments), our IT business partner, and we occasionally draw on resources elsewhere in Shell for specific expertise. Before I discourage anyone, we also started small. The above reflects the HR data &amp; analytics outfit as it stands today. In the past 12 years we have been through all the stages -data cleanup, ad-hoc reporting, centralized reporting- and three years ago we started with advanced analytics in HR.  </p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: I couldn’t have said it any better!</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Shell's HR Analytics team delivers people insights to the business through the combination of six core skill areas</em></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: I don’t think there is a single recipe for success. What works for us though is strong senior management support. Sometimes when we find counterintuitive insights, we use senior support to bring the insight to the right audience rather than it ending up in a drawer. </p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: I wouldn’t differentiate in that one – I believe that the most senior support an HR Analytics team can get is from the CHRO. So I would say that to succeed it's pivotal to get the support of the CHRO.</p>, <p><u><strong>David</strong></u>: This is common amongst nearly all of the successful HR analytics teams I have encountered. Senior management sponsorship and commitment from the CHRO and other members of the Executive Leadership team is crucial to getting HR analytics initiatives off the ground, working on projects that are important to the business, enabling (sometimes difficult) decisions to be made and implemented, and communicating successes through the organisation.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: Good quality data is of course a pre-requisite for good analytics. In Shell, we have the luxury of excellent HR data. For organisations that struggle with data quality, I would advise to start with the data that is reliable (rather than dismiss all data because some of it is poor quality). We do have issues with information silos, connecting HR data with business data. It can be a real struggle but if you start with an impactful business question, then the rewards are also high and it is worth all the effort.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Vasilis</strong></u>: Bring to the table insights that are relevant and actionable for the business. Regardless of the high complexity level of the analysis, the results need to be translated to recommended actions that will solve an actual problem.</p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: I suggest skipping all the stats in the conversations and instead talk the language of the business/stakeholder. We offer recommendations for their problems; of course this relates back to starting with the right question!  We often experience a delay between insight and change - decision makers need to get used to evidence from the data. We play an important role in building such capability throughout the HR function.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: We are just starting to uncover the information hidden in HR databases - there are so many more opportunities. And then there are exciting opportunities in new data sources; I am sure we will get to see many at the HR Tech World Congress in Paris this week! From an organization perspective, we need to mature in the integration of analytics in HR decision-making and in integrating with other analytical functions in the business. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: I am not sure I agree with the observation. It seems many companies have put analytics on the agenda, and there is so much new and exciting content and tooling presented at the HR Tech World Congress. Perhaps there are a few issues in the implementation: a lack of senior support or a shortage of analytical skills. But really, I find the progress quite energizing. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong>You're speaking in the Smart Data track at the forthcoming HR Tech World Congress in Paris. What will you cover in this session and why should delegates attend?</strong></p>, <p><u><strong>Esther</strong></u>: We are showing a case study on Cyber Security. We will walk you through an example of an analytics project: the business problem, the data sources, the insights and the outcomes for the business. And further revelations are only for the insiders and that is why you should attend J</p>, <p><u><strong>David</strong></u>: Touché Esther! You’ve certainly whetted the appetite for your session in Paris even more now. Please join Esther and Vasilis for their presentation – <strong>People Characteristics: A Predictor of Cyber-Security Incidents?</strong> – at <strong>14.55</strong> on <strong>Tuesday 25th October</strong> in the <strong>Smart Data</strong> track (<strong>Room 241</strong>). See you there!</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I am grateful to Esther and Vasilis for sharing the HR analytics journey at Shell and for providing some helpful advice to those looking to get started or accelerate their own journeys in this space. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You can follow Esther on <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a>, and Vasilis on <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/vgiagkoulas"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/BiLLGia"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You may also want to check out the following resources to learn more about the HR Analytics journey at Shell:</p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><em><strong>David</strong> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics and the future of work.

David R. Green,"October 20, 2016",The HR Analytics journey at ABN AMRO,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green/,"[<p>People Analytics and data-driven HR is featured prominently on the agenda next week as the <a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>HR Tech World Congress</strong></a> lands in Paris. I’m delighted to be moderating the Smart Data track where leaders from the likes of Microsoft, Shell, ABN AMRO, Cisco and TIAA will be amongst those describing the successes their organisations have enjoyed thanks to their investments in people analytics.</p>, <p>I am interviewing some of these practitioners in the run-up to the conference – please see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>the interview with Dawn Klinghoffer of Microsoft here</em></a>. </p>, <p>I also had the pleasure of catching up recently with <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank""><strong>Patrick Coolen</strong></a>, Head of HR Metrics and Analytics at ABN AMRO, widely recognised as one of the leading global practitioners of people analytics and a regular speaker at HR Tech World.</p>, <p>In our discussion, Patrick and I discussed the people analytics journey at ABN AMRO, tips for those looking to get started on or accelerate their own journeys and what the future may hold for people analytics. Patrick, a highly regarded blogger himself, also offers some tips to any practitioners with aspirations of sharing their work with the wider community. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Sure, I am the Head of HR Metrics and Analytics at ABN AMRO. I have been doing this now for the last three years. My department is responsible for strategic workforce planning and analytics. I was always passionate about HR activities such as performance management, succession management and talent management. However, the longer I spent in HR, the more curious I became on investigating the actual impact, or return on investment if you will, of HR on our business. So what really happens when engagement increases to products sold? Or what is the actual effect of developing a specific leadership style on client satisfaction or net growth? Answering these types of questions demands a more fact-based or scientific approach. That’s why I started the HR Metrics and Analytics department within the bank.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>For me HR Analytics is the application of statistical or data mining techniques on combined datasets from HR and the business in order to support decision making in the organisation. I think it is tremendously important because it is <em><strong>the</strong></em> vehicle that allows HR and the business to get a better grip on the impact of HR policies and activities on actual business goals. Using statistics or data mining techniques (having a smarter look at your data) also reduces human bias, something we are suffering from.</p>, <p>I am tempted to direct you my article on ‘The 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics’! Seriously though, I think the three most important factors when starting in my opinion are:</p>, <p><em>David – Thanks Patrick and you are right to reference your article on ‘The 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics’. Everyone interested in People Analytics should read this article, particularly the recently updated ‘Crowdsourced Version’ – please </em><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-crowd-version-patrick-coolen?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank""><em>click here to read the article</em></a><em> or view the image below from an earlier version.</em></p>, <p><em>Figure 1: Patrick Coolen's original 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The skills mentioned above (please also reference my article <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/practitioners-view-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank""><em>‘A Practitioner’s View on HR Analytics'</em></a>) are all important. It depends on your own organisation if these skills are available in terms of quality and quantity. When we started at ABN AMRO, we did not have a data scientist in our organisation (that wanted to work in HR) so we aligned with an external partner (<a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>iNostix by Deloitte</em></a>) to perform the advanced analytics for us. Or I should say ‘with’ us. But if your organisation has a mature advanced analytics team internally this team would of course be the logical partner for you. We also partnered with another partner (<a href=""http://www.brightcompany.nl/en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Bright &amp; Company</em></a>) to create a learning program for HR on advanced analytics as well as for strategic workforce planning. This helped enable the wider culture change required to make the HR Analytics initiative sustainable within the organisation.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Patrick Coolen and </em><a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/auke-ijsselstein-8186055"" target=""_blank""><em>Auke IJsselstein</em></a><em>'s HR Analytics Capability Wheel - the premise being to achieve a balanced blend of skills - read more in </em><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/practitioners-view-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank""><em>'A Practitioner's View on HR Analytics'</em></a></p>, <p>The cliché is true - garbage in equals garbage out. But having said that, missing values or losing some records when connecting data does not always have to be a problem for analytics. Reporting is in that sense arguably much more dependent on high quality data. Reports must be accurate. For analytics it is okay to create models for a population of 10,000 using only a few thousand records. It is also true that within an analytical research project you might be able to solve some of the data problems like missing values as you go.  </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Nice try David. This is exactly what I will present at the HR Tech World Congress in Paris! We have many examples, but in Paris I will address cases in the areas of retail, private banking and one of our call centre departments. We focused on predicting actual business outcomes like net growth, client satisfaction and for instance average handling time. So I invite everyone to join my session to learn how we approached these projects and also to hear about some of the results :-)</p>, <p><em>David - Touch</em>é<em> Patrick, let's wait for the great unveiling in Paris! For now, I'll just include an image below, which highlights a few of the analytics projects you have undertaken at ABN AMRO.</em></p>, <p><em>Figure 3: An example of some of the research projects undertaken by ABN AMRO's HR Analytics team</em></p>, <p>There are two mandatory items for me here. First, always use subject matter experts from the business in your research. They know how the data is collected, what the data means, if there is any bias in the data and how to interpret the outcomes. This is vital in getting the right buy-in from the business. Secondly, do not present regression tables or technical stuff to your audience. Think of the story you want to tell and create the right visualisations to support your message. This is closely related to one of my earlier answers on the need for having good consultancy skills.</p>, <p>I believe that HR Analytics, or People Analytics if you prefer, will be a standard strategic component of HR in the future. Although a lot of organisations are lagging behind according to the recent Bersin by Deloitte report, People Analytics will not go away. But it will be one of the fundamental drivers in supporting the transformation of HR towards being more fact-based. I predict also the revival of strategic workforce planning in the near future. I also believe that there will be further investments in creating an analytical state of mind and capabilities across the rest of HR too. </p>, <p>That is a great question. I also ask myself that question. I guess we should ask those organisations that did not start yet! I think most HR activities today are not executed in a fact-based matter. It is simply not where HR is historically coming from. Statistics is something new for HR. But my advice is don’t be afraid of statistics, you can get help with that. Just concentrate on the right business question, create a capable team and you should be fine. </p>, <p>Thanks for the compliment. For us conferences like the HR Tech World Congress and blogs like yours were vital in our analytical journey. In the beginning it was more about learning best practises from other practitioners and industry influencers. Later it was more to learn about specific topics like tools and techniques being used or simply to get inspired on research topics. It is going pretty fast in the world of analytics so speaking at and attending conferences is a way for us to keep up with the latest trends and developments.</p>, <p>I enjoy writing blogs myself, and I guess I am ‘most’ proud on my series on the ‘10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics’. It shows how we learn every year and it was fun to include opinions of others in the last ‘crowd’ version. </p>, <p>And tips for other bloggers/ speakers? I have to think about that. I guess stay true to your own style, be yourself, and think about your audience. What do they want to hear or read? And what do you want them to remember after your presentation or blog? And focus on answering those questions with as much real examples as possible. </p>, <p><em>Patrick Coolen (right) with <a href=""http://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> (centre), Co-founder at iNostix by Deloitte (who partner with ABN AMRO on their HR Analytics research) and me (left) photographed just after we'd been on a panel discussing People Analytics at the Beyond HR Leadership Forum</em></p>, <p>Thanks a lot to Patrick for recounting the ABN AMRO journey with HR Analytics and for sharing his insights on building capability in this exciting area of HR.

David R. Green,"October 17, 2016",The HR Analytics journey at Microsoft,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green/,"[<p>I’m fortunate to be moderating a stellar line up of speakers in the <strong>Smart Data</strong> track at the upcoming <a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech World Congress</a> in Paris on 25th and 26th October. Leaders from Microsoft, Shell, ABN AMRO, Cisco and TIAA will be amongst those describing some of the successes their companies have enjoyed thanks to their investment in people analytics. Real life examples are invaluable to the many wishing to get started or accelerate their own efforts in this burgeoning space of HR.</p>, <p>I caught up recently with one of those speakers – <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank""><strong>Dawn Klinghoffer</strong></a>, General Manager of the HR Business Insights team at Microsoft. We discussed the capability she has built, some of the successes she has had and where the focus for people analytics will be in the future as well as previewing Dawn’s presentation in Paris. Dawn also offers plenty of tips for those looking to build their own capabilities in HR with regards to analytics.</p>, <p>Sure David, I lead the HR Business Insights team at Microsoft – a team that provides people analytics, reporting, analytical tools and technology for our HR Line and Centers of Excellence within the HR Organization. I have always been a numbers person – I majored in mathematics when I was in college, and then went on to become an Actuary. I was just not really that passionate about insurance, and found my way to Microsoft. I started in Finance, and when I returned from maternity leave after having my first child, I was asked to join HR, as the head of Comp &amp; Ben at the time thought there should be more people with analytics capability within HR. I told him that as long as I could work part-time, then it was a deal. After working part-time for 5 years, and taking over the leadership of the team – I realized it was my calling, and I have been doing this work ever since. It has been quite a journey, I had no idea I was heading towards an amazing opportunity to create a future profession.</p>, <p><em>David – Dawn, you’re not the first people analytics leader (and nor do I think you’ll be last!) to describe the profession as ‘a calling’. That’s brilliant and indicative of the passion and energy I’ve seen on show when I’ve seen you speak at conferences.</em></p>, <p>I believe that analytics in HR is the ‘how’ you differentiate yourself as a company by really understanding what is going on with your talent, and propose changes using a data driven approach. This leads to informed decisions that you can measure over time to ensure success.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I believe there are five factors to consider for starters:</p>, <p><strong>What skills/capability do you need to do analytics? How is the team structured at Microsoft?</strong> </p>, <p>It is vital in my view that you combine some type of math/data analytics/industrial organizational psychology/MBA consulting skills with an understanding of the Human Resources profession. It is important to have a well-rounded team. It’s like a puzzle, and all these skills need to work together to really create and drive powerful insights into HR. In addition, it doesn’t hurt to have someone on the team with expertise in privacy – because employee data privacy is extremely important. We need to always make sure we are using employee data in appropriate ways. </p>, <p>The HRBI organization in Microsoft is made up of 4 teams (<em>see <strong>Figure</strong> above</em>), plus an HR Data Privacy Manager: </p>, <p>These teams need to partner seamlessly in order to execute our vision of <strong>#datadrivenHR</strong>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There are a lot of answers to this question. The function should sit where it has line of sight in the overall strategy of the HR organization. I think it is extremely important to have the support of the CHRO to ensure the function is truly leveraging data when people decisions are made – in particular our programs. My experience has also been that employees (not just HR) will support this type of organization when it means that their feedback is being heard – and enables better programmatic decision-making.</p>, <p>Yes, the quality of people data is super important – but how clean really depends on the size of the organization. If you have a very large organization, and your data is 90% clean – getting it to 100% if you are looking at the data in aggregate, probably won’t make too much of a difference. But it really all depends on what you are looking at, and how granular you need to get. If you really want HR to leverage data, you need to have a data quality strategy – it has to be a priority, otherwise you will lose credibility. My advice is to set up some audits on the most important data fields you need to make decisions (and ideally aligned to the HR Strategy), and create a data governance council, made up of folks from IT, Operations and Analytics. When there is a data quality issue, you can get the right people in the room to address it.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The business problem had to do with <strong>Internal Mobility</strong> – and a perception that it was easier to find a job outside of Microsoft than it was inside. To learn more, we looked at a lot of data including historical transfer rates, engagement survey results, attrition rates and exit survey results. What we discovered was that employees who had made a recent job transfer within Microsoft were more positive about their career and more engaged than non-transfers, and employees who transferred had higher levels of engagement and better perception of career possibilities at Microsoft. In fact, we found internal transfers were more likely to stay at Microsoft than non-transfers. With that information, we took a look at our current policies around job transfers, and realized that we could help enable more transfers if we simplified our transfer process. We removed some of the restrictions (manager approval, length in role, etc), and have seen an increase in the internal mobility within the company, and a decrease in the sentiment that it is easier to find a job outside the company.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Well first you need to really understand the business problem you are trying to solve. If you have nailed that, and the data and analytics that you provide are compelling enough, then you will help drive decisions. It is important to really work in collaboration with the business, not just be an order taker, but understand the problem and the nuances. The more you are able to do that, the easier it is to drive decisions. Also, know your audience. If you know how your audience likes to visualize data, then it makes it easier to tell a story that will resonate with them. Make sure you connect with your audience, and again, make sure that the analysis you have completed answers the right business problem.</p>, <p>I think there is a lot of great momentum in this field right now. I think we are just now seeing the value that data can bring to not only decision-making, but also the drive for action. Productivity data is becoming more accessible – and if you can correlate productivity (email/calendar metadata) with engagement and performance – you can start to understand as a manager, what type of actions drive engagement on my team? How long should meetings be for optimal performance? Who are the most influential people in my network? A little over a year ago Microsoft acquired a company called VoloMetrix, which specializes in productivity metrics. We have been partnering with them on analytics (only US employees), and are starting to see some exciting insights.</p>, <p>Where I think we are going to see the biggest change is in the HR profession overall, as analytics start to reinvent the way we work. We are now starting to look for HR professionals that have the capability to understand, interpret and leverage data – and this is a trend that I believe will continue for a while. Data Analytics in general is making its way into the Universities – there are already a couple of programs that actually teach people analytics – Northeastern and the McComb Business School at the University of Texas are two examples. </p>, <p>Lastly, I think another potential trend is around data privacy – ensuring that people data is used appropriately and shared for the right business purposes. This is an area that we are really focused on at Microsoft, and I believe other companies will as well. I think the future is bright, and I am so excited to be a part of this transformation.</p>, <p>In some organizations it has been spectacular, but even steady is very positive. I think that until recently, many companies didn’t have one place to store all of their people data. People data were stored in multiple systems, and there was not an easy way to bring the data together to create a cohesive story. I think as more and more companies leverage tools such as SAP Success Factors and Workday, analyzing people data will become more accessible and usable.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I will be talking about the HR data evolution that’s changing the way we think about and view employee productivity. I will explain how Microsoft has leveraged the power of HR dashboards and the benefits of data visualization for real-time decision-making, I will discuss the emerging area of productivity metrics – and how Microsoft HR is correlating productivity with engagement and performance to influence our management strategy. Delegates should attend if they are interested in hearing about Microsoft’s journey in this space and how they could leverage these tools to help them drive value and impact within their businesses.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Thanks a lot to Dawn for telling us about her journey at Microsoft and also for sharing her expertise with those looking to progress their people analytics programs to the next level. For those going or planning to go to Paris, Dawn’s presentation – <em><strong>Data and Insights: Not Just For Analysts Anymore </strong></em>– will be at <em><strong>12:05</strong></em> on <em><strong>Tuesday 25th October</strong></em> in the <em><strong>Smart Data</strong></em> track (<em><strong>Room 241</strong></em>) – you can still buy tickets for the HR Tech World Congress <a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/tickets"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You can follow Dawn on <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You may also want to read the following articles, which provide further information on Microsoft's People Analytics journey as well as details of their acquisition of VoloMetrix:</p>, <p>Also please feel free to dip into the other People Analytics practitioner interviews in the series: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-1-anshul-sheopuri-ibm-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Anshul Sheopuri (IBM)</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-2-mark-berry-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a></p>, <p>Look out also for further interviews with leading People Analytics practitioners in the coming months.</p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><em><strong>David</strong> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics and the future of work.

David R. Green,"September 19, 2016","The People Analytics Interviews: #1 Anshul Sheopuri, IBM",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-1-anshul-sheopuri-ibm-david-green/,"[<p>As more organisations adopt people analytics and interest levels in the subject within the HR community continues to rise, it is vital that those getting started are able to draw inspiration and learning from the premier practitioners, organisations and influencers in the space.</p>, <p>Consequently, I am delighted to present the first of a regular series of interviews with the leading lights in the people analytics community. Where better to start than with <strong>IBM</strong>, which since 2010 has developed one of the most advanced people analytics capabilities of any organisation on the planet. </p>, <p>IBM is increasingly looking to cognitive computing to further progress the benefits people analytics has already provided to the company and its employees, so I was excited to get together with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/anshul-sheopuri-7945411"" target=""_blank""><strong>Anshul Sheopuri</strong></a>, Director of the People Analytics team at IBM to find out more.</p>, <p>Sure, David. I am the Director of the People Analytics team at IBM Corporate Headquarters where I lead a team of 60 analytics experts to build, accelerate and scale the impact of IBM's workforce analytics solutions across the analytics spectrum from self-serve reporting to next-generation cognitive capabilities. The team delivers significant, measurable, financial impact and works across the IBM organisation including business such as Research, Watson and the Smarter Workforce functions. Prior to this role, I led a variety of big data and cognitive initiatives at the IBM T J Watson Research Centre for over 8 years in fields like marketing, HR, financial services, food and even fashion.</p>, <p>Getting into this role was by sheer accident. About 7 years ago, one of our HR leaders and now CHRO, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-gherson-1b93b77"" target=""_blank""><strong>Diane Gherson</strong></a>, saw the potential of applying analytics to reduce employee attrition, and reached out to the Research division to partner and build a solution. Having a deep analytics background, but not in HR then, I was roped in to model the problem and build the analytics. Seeing the impact that analytics could drive in HR excited me, and I have been working in this area ever since.</p>, <p>A couple of key accomplishments include:</p>, <p>We all know about the opportunities Big Data offers to HR – the ability for machines to crunch large amounts of employee and social data and find meaningful patterns for HR decisions. Cognitive is much more than just Big Data – it is about systems that: </p>, <p>I believe that the impact of Cognitive Computing on HR will be transformational. Imagine if you had a digital assistant that stayed with you from when you first interacted with the company, helped steer your onboarding and was then your coach and guide throughout your career, knowing you and giving you unbiased advice and help on all topics that may interest you. For example, you could ask <em>“who would be a good mentor for me?”</em>, <em>“what skills should I develop? How?”</em>, or <em>“how do other people move across Business Units?”</em> And, if you do not get a satisfactory response, you would engage your mentor, manager or colleague, as you do now.</p>, <p>With Cognitive Computing, employees will be empowered with unbiased advice and have complex insights available at their fingertips - so they can make informed decisions and consult with their peers and managers on more challenging subjects where deep dialogue is essential. In this new reality, the role of the HR practitioner will evolve to one of a consultant who can nimbly leverage Cognitive solutions and add additional value where the technology has ""blind spots.""</p>, <p>We are at the early stages of this journey. We are building a number of Cognitive applications that provide solutions to employee problems at different stages of the <strong>employee lifecycle:</strong> </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: IBM is building cognitive applications across the employee lifecycle</em></p>, <p>What have we learned? Some key elements of success are due to the formation of inter-disciplinary agile teams that span different Business Units, using design thinking to identify key problems to solve for the users, re-using existing tools as accelerators in the solution, and developing a 90-day MVP. We have a few <strong>early proof points:</strong></p>, <p><em>Figure 2: IBM is already realising benefits from Cognitive HR applications </em></p>, <p>If I had to distill advice to an organisation or individual looking to get started with people analytics, I’d summarise into five key points: </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You can connect with and follow Anshul on <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/anshul-sheopuri-7945411"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/anshulsheopuri"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>You may also want to check out the following articles, which also highlight IBM’s endeavours in the people analytics space:</p>, <p><em>WATCH: IBM CHRO Diane Gherson described how cognitive is transforming HR at the company at the HR Summit in London in June 2016 </em></p>, <p><em>WATCH: See how ATB Financial is using cognitive technology to identify what makes their best teams and individuals successful, how they could replicate that success, and thus improve client satisfaction and business performance.</em></p>, <p>Look out also for further interviews with leading People Analytics practitioners in the coming months.</p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><em><strong>David</strong> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics and the future of work.

David R.

Collectively, they should provide a combination of learning and inspiration to those looking to embark on their own journeys in this burgeoning area of HR. </p>, <p>Here's this week's ten...</p>, <p>One of the most impressive stories I’ve heard in the last year comes from LinkedIn. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzocanlas"" target=""_blank""><em>Lorenzo Canlas</em></a>, who used to head up the team, wrote an excellent article describing <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-built-talent-analytics-linkedin-lorenzo-canlas?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>‘How we built Talent Analytics at LinkedIn’</em></strong></a>, which outlines their journey (read in tandem with the Slideshare below by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamgaker"" target=""_blank""><em>William Gaker</em></a>). A specific example of the power of analytics came from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite"" target=""_blank""><em>Rebecca White</em></a> at the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-goes-orbit-10-takeaways-from-pafow-16-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>People Analytics &amp; Future of Work Conference in San Francisco</em></a> earlier this year. Rebecca explained how LinkedIn had used analytics to improve its identification and prioritisation of critical talent for hiring engineers. The analytics team worked with product and talent acquisition to create a four-box prioritisation model that proved so successful in its nine-month pilot that an adapted version was included as part of a future release of LinkedIn Recruiter.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Another hugely impressive story comes from Dutch bank ABN AMRO and their Head of HR Analytics, <a href=""https://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank""><em>Patrick Coolen</em></a> – who has deservedly built a reputation as one of the leading people analytics practitioners on the planet. Patrick started the analytics journey at the bank four years ago, and <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/blog/en/the-hr-analytics-journey-at-abn-amro-interview-with-patrick-coolen/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>this interview with Luk Smeyers of iNostix</em></strong></a>, provides an illuminating view on Patrick’s approach and also some of the key decisions he has had to make along the way such as whether to hire data scientists into his own team or work with external partners. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/0_3c4BWnDFdi-jH4FdMmJzwV?trk=prof-sm"" target=""_blank""><em>Patrick’s LinkedIn blog</em></a> and the Slideshare below of his presentation at HR Tech World in Paris from 2015 also provide some fascinating insights into how Patrick and the team at ABN AMRO operates.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>IBM is widely regarded as one of the leading organisations globally when it comes to people analytics. The company started its journey in 2010, under the leadership of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank""><em>Jonathan Ferrar</em></a>, and six years later and now under the stewardship of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-stachura-3842308"" target=""_blank""><em>Tom Stachura</em></a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/anshul-sheopuri-7945411"" target=""_blank""><em>Anshul Sheopuri</em></a>, the Workforce Analytics team has grown to 70+. The successes have been well documented, with continued impetus coming from CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-gherson-1b93b77"" target=""_blank""><em>Diane Gherson</em></a> – the epitome of the 21st Century data-driven HR leader. Two articles highlighting Diane’s belief that analytics is central to HR, the business and the employee can be found here in <a href=""https://www.peoplematters.in/article/hr-analytics/diane-gherson-how-analytics-changing-game-hr-12633"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>People Matters</em></a> and <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think-leaders/pacesetters/diane-gherson/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Think Leaders</em></a>. The benefits delivered to the business through the insights of the Workforce Analytics team have been numerous and varied. For example, as Diane indicated in her keynote at the 2016 IBM HR Summit in London, the ability to predict and prevent regrettable attrition has created a net benefit of $270m alone. Another example comes from the employee sentiment analysis IBM conducts on internal and external social media.

This means that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernestngphd"" target=""_blank""><em>Ernest Ng</em></a> and his team have some unique challenges to face with regards to people analytics. In <a href=""http://hiqlabs.squarespace.com/podcast/2016/7/11/episode-003"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>this great podcast</em></strong></a> with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhousman"" target=""_blank""><em>Michael Housman</em></a> of hiQ Labs recorded in the summer of 2016, Ernest shares some insights around prioritisation and key focus areas particularly with regards to sales. To see more from Ernest you may also want to view the video below, where he and <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/timwesson"" target=""_blank""><em>Tim Wesson</em></a> outline three case studies of how Salesforce uses data, analytics, and culture to disrupt where, who, and how to recruit.</p>, <p>Recruiting is arguably the perfect shop window in HR for analytics as not only is hiring great people of utmost importance, but hiring is high-volume, comprised of repeatable processes, and for too long has been primarily based on intuition and unconscious bias. One organisation that has applied analytics in this area is JetBlue. This article <a href=""http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/should-hiring-be-based-on-gut-or-data/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>‘Should Hiring be Based on Gut - or Data?’</em></strong></a> gives a fascinating insight into how the airline used customer data that being ‘helpful’ was a more important characteristic in its flight attendants than being ‘nice’ - the attribute previously prioritised when selecting new hires. Consequently, JetBlue reengineered its recruitment process and has enjoyed measurable benefits including higher engagement and retention, lower absence and a half-point boost in its Net Promoter Score, which translates to a lot of additional dollars in the airline industry. The first ten minutes of the video below features <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andybiga"" target=""_blank""><em>Andy Biga</em></a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-dullaghan-83b21912"" target=""_blank""><em>Ryan Dullaghan</em></a> presenting the JetBlue story at the Wharton People Analytics Conference. </p>, <p>Getting started with people analytics can be difficult. This is especially so where the HR and the business needs to be educated on what analytics is and the benefits it can bring. That’s what makes this story of how <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/aggninder-dhillon-b3a79852"" target=""_blank""><em>Aggy Dhillon</em></a> and her small three-person team enabled <a href=""http://diginomica.com/2015/10/27/virgin-media-cures-high-sickness-rates-with-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>‘Virgin Media to Cure High Sickness Rates with Analytics’</em></strong></a> so uplifting. Despite high engagement and low attrition, absence levels in call centres averaged 20 days a year. The insights offered enabled absence rates to be reduced from 9% to 4%, saving the business £750,000. A great first step in what will likely prove a fruitful journey.</p>, <p>When I co-chaired the Tucana People Analytics Conference for the first time in 2015, one of the most impressive stories came from <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ben-hawley-3616023"" target=""_blank""><em>Ben Hawley</em></a>, who outlined the great work <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/placidjover"" target=""_blank""><em>Placid Jover</em></a><em> (</em>who has now passed the baton to<em> </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicky-clement-34241241/"" target=""_blank""><em>Nicky Clement</em></a><em>), </em>he and the team were doing with HR analytics at Unilever. Two of the key building blocks in enabling Unilever’s success are highlighted on the Valuing Your Talent site. First up is having a clear vision linking people measures with business performance as <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/media/Case%20study%20-%20Unilever%20-%20PDF_tcm1044-5904.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>this case study</em></a> featuring the now-retired former CHRO Doug Baillie makes crystal clear. Secondly, is this podcast with <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/james-stringer-869235a"" target=""_blank""><em>James Stringer</em></a>, HRIS &amp; Analytics Director, which describes Unilever’s data journey, which now sees a single HR system in place across 104 countries and also outlines the 78 core HR metrics that Unilever collects about each employee. </p>, <p>Like Coca-Cola Enterprises, I’ve seen the Nestlé story in the UK &amp; Ireland develop over a number of years as <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michael-cox-43228955"" target=""_blank""><em>Michael Cox</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/katyfbowers"" target=""_blank""><em>Katy Bowers</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michael-wilkinson-947b4658"" target=""_blank""><em>Michael Wilkinson</em></a> and <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jude-fletcher-6322b631"" target=""_blank""><em>Jude Fletcher</em></a> regularly share their progress on the conference circuit. <a href=""http://diginomica.com/2015/10/22/nestle-nestles-down-to-hr-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>This article in Diginomica</em></strong></a> describes how the team drilled down to find the specific causes of attrition and the resultant changes that were implemented from the insights of the analysis.</p>, <p>Lastly as a bonus as it is not really a case study per se, but perhaps something even better. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank""><em>Mark Berry</em></a> built his reputation in this space by <a href=""http://searchfinancialapplications.techtarget.com/feature/ConAgra-Foods-VP-builds-HR-analytics-program-from-the-ground-up"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>building a people analytics function from scratch at ConAgra Foods</em></a>.

David R. Green,"August 1, 2016",40 People Analytics Case Studies - Part 1,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green/,"[<p>In the not too distant future, analytics will become a core component of HR’s standard practice. I’ve seen at first hand over the last 12 months that interest levels in people analytics are soaring. Adoption levels, though rising, are not increasing at anywhere near the same level. </p>, <p>In my view the primary reason for this is that HR as a whole is still struggling to get to grips with analytics and the wider need for the function to adopt a more data-driven approach to the work it does. </p>, <p>One way to help HR on its way is to highlight examples of great work that the pioneers in this space are doing. Not so those seeking to embark on their people analytics journey can merely imitate their peers, but so that they can learn from the successes others have had and apply these to their own organisations. </p>, <p>Over the next few days (see also <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?published=t"" target=""_blank"">Part 2</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-more-people-analytics-case-studies-part-i-david-green?published=t"" target=""_blank"">Part 3</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-ii-david-green?published=t"" target=""_blank"">Part 4</a>), I’ll highlight 40 success stories covering companies of all shapes and sizes, a myriad of business challenges that were solved and enough inspiration to propel the first manned flight to Mars. </p>, <p>Now we’re all aboard the rocket, it’s time for blast off… </p>, <p>Where else to start, but with the poster boy of all things analytics in HR. Whilst some organisations were quietly experimenting with data based decision making in HR, it was Google that popularised it, branded it (as People Analytics) and took it to the next level. There’s a wealth of information out there on how they built and subsequently grew its capability, so I’ll just reference three. For a start, there’s <a href=""https://www.workrules.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>‘Work Rules!’</em></a>: the book written by Google’s former HR Chief <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock"" target=""_blank""><em>Laszlo Bock</em></a>. Then, there’s this teaser article <a href=""http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/open-sourcing-googles-hr-secrets/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>‘Open Sourcing Google’s HR Secrets’</em></strong></a>. Finally, I’d urge you to watch the video below featuring <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5"" target=""_blank""><em>Prasad Setty</em></a>, Google’s VP of People Analytics and Compensation.</p>, <p>A different medium but no less fascinating is this <a href=""http://www.blogtalkradio.com/hrexaminer/2016/07/12/hrexaminer-radio-vasilis-giagkoulas-and-esther-bongenaar-of-shell"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>HRExaminer Radio interview</em></strong></a> by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsumser"" target=""_blank""><em>John Sumser</em></a> with <a href=""https://nl.linkedin.com/in/vgiagkoulas"" target=""_blank""><em>Vasileios Giagkoulas</em></a> and <a href=""https://nl.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a"" target=""_blank""><em>Esther Bongenaar</em></a> from Shell’s HR Analytics team. Of the many organisations I have encountered, Shell is one of the most mature when it comes to people analytics. In this 30 minute interview, we find out some of the secrets of Shell’s success, the type of work they are doing and get a sneak preview of what Shell will be presented at the <a href=""https://www.hrtechcongress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>HR Tech World conference</em></a> in Paris last October. </p>, <p>One of the advantages of what I do is that I get to see at first-hand examples of the great work practitioners are doing in this space. That certainly applies to my good fortune of being one of the judges of the <a href=""http://workforceanalyticsawards.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Workforce Analytics Excellence Awards</em></a> in 2016. This entry from Nielsen – winner of the People’s Choice Award at the US awards in New York in May 2016, really resonated. Not only did the project provide insights on the main factors impacting attrition at the firm (a key priority for top management), it also provided actionable solutions and measurable results. What made a great submission even better was this superb video to support the entry. Storytelling is a key component of people analytics and this ticks all the boxes – kudos to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyushmathur"" target=""_blank""><em>Piyush Mathur</em></a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougshagam"" target=""_blank""><em>Doug Shagam</em></a> for their wonderfully inventive work here and also for allowing me to showcase the video in this article.

David R. Green,"July 25, 2016",15 tips to help HR get started with People Analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/15-tips-help-hr-get-started-people-analytics-david-green/,"[<p>Interest levels in people analytics and data driven HR is soaring and whilst adoption levels are not increasing at the same dazzling rate, more and more organisations are developing their capability in this area (see recently published research by <em><a href=""https://www-935.ibm.com/services/c-suite/study/studies/chro-study/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">IBM</a>, <a href=""http://dupress.com/articles/people-analytics-in-hr-analytics-teams/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Deloitte</a>, <a href=""http://www.i4cp.com/productivity-blogs/2016/06/22/study-nearly-70-of-executive-teams-use-workforce-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">i4CP</a></em> and <em><a href=""http://futurehrtrends.eiu.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">EIU/SHRM</a></em>). </p>, <p>The <em><a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/demystifying-people-analytics-part-2-skills-capabilities-need/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">skills and capabilities</a></em> required for analytics have not traditionally resided within HR. For many HR functions analytics represents nothing less than a cultural shift and the need to embrace a fresh mindset. In short, analytics isn’t easy (though perhaps not as difficult as some may think), and as such many HR professionals are still struggling to get to grips with it. </p>, <p>It is perhaps not surprising therefore that I am continually asked questions like: Where do I start? How can I find out more? Are there any courses I can take? Which organisations have already mastered it? What projects should we start with? </p>, <p>As such, whilst not an exhaustive guide, this article is intended to help the budding aspirant with 15 tips to help get started: </p>, <p>The first commandment of analytics is ‘<strong>thou shalt start with the business problem’</strong>. Successful people analytics teams help solve business rather than HR problems. This means understanding the business. What are the challenges keeping your CXO awake at night? Think sales productivity, product quality, customer retention and risk. This is where the company makes money and what determines its ultimate success. Learn the business and when you are ready to commence your analytics initiatives, focus your efforts here and you can expect to flourish. <strong>Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it’s an essential ingredient for analytics</strong>.</p>, <p>There are a plethora of books on getting familiar with analytics – here are four to get you started: <a href=""https://hbr.org/product/keeping-up-with-the-quants-your-guide-to-understan/an/11177-HBK-ENG"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>‘Keeping up with the Quants’</em></a> by Tom Davenport (widely recognised as the Godfather of analytics); <em><a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1444792385/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469199312&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=work+rules+laszlo+bock"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘Work Rules!’</a></em> by Google’s HR Chief Laszlo Bock; <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/HR-Analytics-The-What-Why/dp/1492739162/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392393970&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=HR+analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>‘HR Analytics: The what, why and how’</em></a> by Tracey Smith and <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cole-Nussbaumer-Knaflic/e/B013RK32CW"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘Storytelling with Data’</a></em> by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic. Also keep a look out for <em><a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1469199373&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=jonathan+ferrar"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘The Power of People: How Successful Organizations Use Workforce Analytics to Improve Business Performance</a></em>’ by Jonathan Ferrar, Sheri Feinzig and Nigel Guenole, which from the preview I've had promises to be one of the best yet - it is published on December 5th 2016. </p>, <p>Figure 1: Five recommended books on people analytics to read (L-R: Keeping Up with the Quants by Thomas Davenport &amp; Jinho Kim; Work Rules! by Laszlo Bock; HR Analytics: The What, Why and How... by Tracey Smith; Storytelling with Data by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic and The Power of People by Jonathan Ferrar, Sheri Feinzig and Nigel Guenole</p>, <p>Likewise, there are a number of superb blogs on people analytics that anyone with interest in the subject should subscribe to. Here’s a few to get you started: iNostix’s <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/blog/en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>HR Analytics Insights Blog</em></a>; Google’s <em><a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Re:Work</a>;</em> OrgVue’s <a href=""http://blog.orgvue.com/category/hr-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>HR Analytics Blog</em></a>; Morten Kamp Andersen’s <em><a href=""https://mortenkamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">All About Human Capital</a></em>; the new and rather good <em><a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a></em> , the <em><a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRN blog</a></em> and Andrew Marritt’s <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/0_1W8kEWV0sI4j8DQFpAP1OU?trk=prof-sm"" target=""_blank"">thoughtful articles on LinkedIn</a></em>. </p>, <p>Whilst the majority of LinkedIn groups are about as useful as a cat flap in an elephant house, this is thankfully not the case when it comes to specialist people analytics groups. My favourite two are: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=73460&amp;trk=my_groups-tile-flipgrp"" target=""_blank""><em>Measuring Human Capital</em></a> and <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7424059"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics: Data Driven HR</a></em> which are managed respectively by Jeremy Shapiro and Barry Swales, each have over 3,000 members and both feature a regular supply of thought provoking discussions. </p>, <p>A great way to keep up with the latest news and discussion points on people analytics is to follow key influencers on social media. There are too many to list in this article, but here's a bunch to get you going (all links are LinkedIn profiles, do search them out on Twitter too): <em><a href=""https://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyashapiro"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Shapiro</a>, <a href=""https://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/davemillner"" target=""_blank"">Dave Millner</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgadomski"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Gadomski</a>, <a href=""https://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-roberts-b0217"" target=""_blank"">Greta Roberts</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/martinoest"" target=""_blank"">Martin Oest</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a>, <a href=""https://ca.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a>, <a href=""https://dk.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcwest"" target=""_blank"">Mike West</a>, <a href=""https://in.linkedin.com/in/manojkumarhranalytics"" target=""_blank"">Manoj Kumar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardrosenow"" target=""_blank"">Richard Rosenow</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Spence</a>, <a href=""https://au.linkedin.com/in/ddellala"" target=""_blank"">Damien Delalla</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemmoon"" target=""_blank"">Michael M Moon</a></em>. </p>, <p>Not everyone can be a data scientist, but that doesn’t mean taking an online course won’t accelerate your progress. Earlier this year, I took the <em><a href=""https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wharton People Analytics course</a></em> on Coursera. It only took a couple of hours per week for four weeks and I thought it was well worthwhile. You can check out some other courses <em><a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/blog/hr-analytics-courses/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a></em>. </p>, <p>HR is renowned as a function that is pretty adept at networking, so get those black books out and speak to colleagues who have already embarked on the yellow brick road of people analytics. There are a number of people analytics specific networking groups that have cropped up, and collaborative initiatives like <em><a href=""http://hros.co/#what-is-hros"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Open Source (#HROS)</a></em> can also help you learn, share and explore. </p>, <p>Speaking of networking, there has been a phenomenal rise in the number of conferences either dedicated to people analytics or where the subject features prominently on the agenda. Check out my recent blog<em>: <strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/22-conferences-people-analytics-attend-201617-david-green?published=u"" target=""_blank"">23 People Analytics Conferences to attend in 2016/17</a></strong></em> to find one (or more) that suits you.

As Luk Smeyers has written, if based in HR people analytics simply <em><a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/hr-analytics-you-report-to-the-chro-period/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">has to report to the CHRO</a></em>. Get your CHRO excited and get them involved. S/he should have a good understanding of the key business challenges, the influence to ensure that compelling stories are delivered to the right business leader and, crucially, that changes are then implemented. With a <em><a href=""http://huntscanlon.com/data-driven-chros-demand-role-shifts-complexity/?utm_content=buffer3e961&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">recent survey</a></em> finding that 80% of executives saying their company cannot succeed without an assertive, data-driven CHRO, it may even be good for their career too. That’s the self-interest box ticked then! </p>, <p>By now you should have a detailed knowledge of the business (see Point 1) and a good understanding of the most important challenges your company faces. How many of these can be solved (or partly solved) through analysing people data? Are there any quick wins? Hone your abilities to ask the right questions and to identify those issues that have the biggest potential impact. Recognising that the first 100 days are critical to the success of any business initiative, aspiring people analytics leaders can seek guidance from this <a href=""https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/iwm/web/signup.do?source=swg-US_Lotus_WebMerch&amp;S_PKG=ov37199&amp;S_TACT=C28004HW&amp;dynform=19149&amp;lang=en_US"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>white paper</em></a> from the IBM Smarter Workforce Institute to inform and support their initial strategy.</p>, <p>Make friends with analytics practitioners in Finance, Marketing and IT. Their experience in obtaining, cleaning and analysing data will be invaluable in giving you a head start. Moreover, you will need to combine people and business data to solve business problems, so don’t be shy get out of the HR bubble! </p>, <p>Depending on how bought in your CHRO is, the level of initial investment you are able to secure and the skills you are able to borrow from outside HR, you will need to build a team. The skills and capabilities required are diverse, so this is not an easy undertaking and will likely be an iterative process. <em><a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/demystifying-people-analytics-part-2-skills-capabilities-need/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">See more on building a team here</a></em>. </p>, <p>We all love a good story, don’t we? Successfully driving through initiatives linked to people analytics is no different. Being able to interpret the data, distilling it into insights that unlock the business problem you are trying to solve and then creating a compelling story to frame it are all absolutely key. The quality of your data or incisiveness of your analysis doesn’t matter if you are unable to make it resonate with your business stakeholders. For more on storytelling, I highly recommend watching the video below featuring <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a></em>, VP of People Analytics and Compensation at Google.</p>, <p>Some of the most exciting and innovative work in HR technology is being done in the field of people analytics. New technologies are cropping up all the time in what is a really nascent space, but with careful scrutinisation the budding practitioner can harness some of this capability to help enable and speed their progress.

Evidence of this can be seen in the number of dedicated conferences on the subject sprouting up around the globe and through the increase in analytics and data themed streams at major HR conferences. </p>, <p>This year I’ve spoken, chaired and attended conferences in San Francisco, Amsterdam, London, Sydney and New York, with further trips scheduled for Boston, Seattle, Chicago, Paris and Singapore amongst others before 2016 reaches the end of its cycle. </p>, <p>As such, I thought it would be helpful to create a resource collating the people analytics conferences that I know of around the world. So, here goes…</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In no particular order, but starting with the dedicated people analytics conferences...</p>, <p>I’ve had the honour of co-chairing the People Analytics World conference in London for the last two years. With 300+ delegates at the 2016 edition, this is by my estimation the biggest people analytics conference in Europe. It is also one of the best due to the varied format, array of great speakers (hat tip to chief curator Barry Swales) and the eagerness of delegates to interact and learn. This year also featured the <em><a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-awards-2016-2/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics Awards</a></em>, which proved a great success and another indication of the growing maturity of the practice.

David R. Green,"June 20, 2016",The future of HR is Open Source,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-hr-open-source-david-green/,"[<p>We are living in a time of unprecedented change. This applies to politics – with the worrying rise of Donald Trump in the US and the EU in/out Referendum in the UK, to economics – in the wake of the financial crisis, to technology – where Moore’s Law has multiplied and is set to go into hyperdrive and to business - where digital is changing every single business model.</p>, <p>The impact to the world of work is already multifarious and set to reach epidemic proportions. It’s rare that a day goes past without the likes of Harvard Business Review, The Economist or Forbes declaring that humans are set to be imminently supplanted by robots in the workplace. Even if some of the most dramatic headlines are hyperbole, most of us would concede that the next 5-10 years are going to see work change beyond recognition to an extent perhaps not seen since the Industrial Revolution</p>, <p>As custodians of the people that work for their organisations, HR is right in the frontline. How should it face this onslaught?</p>, <p>Traditionally, HR functions have worked in splendid isolation but perhaps it is time as The Beatles once sang to try to <em>‘get by with a little help from our friends’</em>. It has certainly served the tech community well where collaboration or ‘Open Source’ has become the norm. Not before time this ethos has arrived in HR. </p>, <p><strong>HR Open Source (#HROS)</strong></p>, <p>Collaboration, education and inspiration are three of the key themes of the excellent HR Open Source (#HROS) initiative conjured up by <a href=""https://ca.linkedin.com/in/ambrosiavertesi"" target=""_blank""><em>Ambrosia Vertesi</em></a>, formerly of Hootsuite and now VP People at Duo Security, and Amplify Talent’s <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsschmidt"" target=""_blank""><em>Lars Schmidt</em></a>.</p>, <p>The intent of #HROS is:</p>, <p><em>“…to make it easier for practitioners to access the resources, tips, tools an</em><em>d tricks they need to succeed in today’s world of work while hiring and developing the top talent of tomorrow.”</em></p>, <p>It is less than a year since Ambrosia and Lars launched the #HROS initiative (see video below from last year's LinkedIn Connect conference in Anaheim), and it has really captured the imagination of a HR community increasingly keen to share, learn and make a real impact within their respective organisations. </p>, <p class=""center""><em>Ambrosia Vertesi and Lars Schmidt launch #HROS at LinkedIn Connect, 2015</em></p>, <p>#HROS is a movement designed to encourage employers to open up their HR playbook, share their best practices, inspire and learn from their peers. Fellow HR practitioners are able to access real world examples that they can use and adapt for projects in their own organisations. This is the simple vision – and spirit – driving HROS. </p>, <p>Check out the <a href=""http://hros.co/case-studies/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Case Study page on the #HROS site</a> for great stories from the likes of Cisco, Dell, Hootsuite and CA Technologies, but to highlight three others:</p>, <p>The UK HR and recruiting cognoscenti descended on <a href=""http://www.bartopolski.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bar Topolski</a> in London last week when Ambrosia was in town for the London launch of #HROS. Hat tip to <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/leelasrinivasan"" target=""_blank"">Leela Srinivasan</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jennifercandee"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Candee</a></em> for hosting and organising what was a great evening.

One suspects that the momentum generated will help propel #HROS to new heights this side of the pond. </p>, <p><strong>‘Let’s Make Work Better’</strong></p>, <p>#HROS is not the only high-profile example of Open Source HR either. Validation that Ambrosia and Lars have helped create a concept that will fly can be seen in <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Google’s re:Work initiative</em></a>. Similar to #HROS, re:Work provides a set of tools and lessons from Google and partner organisations, which are designed to <em>‘make work better’</em> irrespective of the organisation. re:Work is organised into four key areas: Hiring, Managers, People Analytics (hurrah!) and Unbiasing, which are four areas Google believes HR practitioners can make a big impact in their respective businesses.

This concept of giving something back to the wider HR and recruiting community is to be applauded. </p>, <p><strong>Open Source in People Analytics</strong></p>, <p>In the people analytics space I inhabit, collaboration and open source are arguably vital to help what is still a nascent concept go mainstream. <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a></em> suggested earlier this year (<em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-takes-off-josh-bersin?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">see article</a></em>) that the exponential growth of people analytics could be set to go into overdrive. I certainly hope so, but still feel HR has some way to go to overcome the three C’s <em><a href=""https://de.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs-55173316"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a><strong>,</strong></em> formerly of CEB, <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/HRTechWorld/its-the-analytics-stupid-ceb"" target=""_blank""><em>described at HR Tech World in Paris</em></a>: Criticality (being able to prioritise efforts based on critical business questions), Capability (being able to apply business judgment to data science), and Credibility (being able to drive end-user ownership of talent analytics). </p>, <p>The plethora of dedicated people analytics conferences that have sprouted up go some way to facilitating collaboration between practitioners. I have chaired, spoken at and/or attended conferences in San Francisco, Amsterdam, London, Sydney and New York this year. At each, the willingness of practitioners to share and learn from each other has been palpable. Long may it continue. I should also highlight the work <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a></em> is doing at the <em><a href=""http://www.talentstrategyinstitute.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Strategy Institute</a></em>, which as well as conferences has created an active community of people analytics practitioners who meet regularly to share and discuss common challenges.  </p>, <p>It is good also to see other initiatives like a confidential one I am part of where several organisations at a relatively advanced level of maturity in the application of people analytics together with academics and other influencers are working closely together to define ‘what next’.  We have gone from sitting around the table together and sharing best practice to effectively going into a joint-venture, investing equally in order to experiment, collaborate and share in what will likely be significant and mutual benefits in the future. </p>, <p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>, <p>As I wrote at the outset of this piece, the pace of change in the workplace is already phenomenal and set to increase. Attempting to cope with this on your own will likely prove impossible. Collaborating with your peers may seem an alien concept to many, but bold initiatives like are required for the future of work and #HROS is one such initiative that may help HR functions keep up.</p>, <p>_____________________________________________________</p>, <p>Note 1: An earlier version of this blog originally appeared on the HRN Blog in December 2015.</p>, <p>Note 2: For those interested in finding out more on #HROS, check out the <a href=""http://hros.co/#what-is-hros"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">homepage</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/opensourcehr/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Facebook Group</a> (with over 1,200 members), follow on Twitter <a href=""https://twitter.com/HROpenSource"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">@HROpenSource</a> and also <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/10486516?trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Acompany%2CentityType%3AentityHistoryName%2CclickedEntityId%3Acompany_10486516%2Cidx%3A1"" target=""_blank"">see on LinkedIn</a>.</p>, <p>_____________________________________________________</p>, <p><strong>About the author</strong></p>, <p><em><strong>David</strong> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics and the future of work.

David R. Green,"May 16, 2016",Relegating Cost Per Hire to its rightful place,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/relegating-cost-per-hire-its-rightful-place-david-green/,"[<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/louadler"" target=""_blank"">Lou Adler</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-john-sullivan-655131"" target=""_blank"">Dr. John Sullivan</a> have long questioned the validity of the cost-per-hire metric when evaluating the business impact (or otherwise) of talent acquisition functions. Indeed, John has even gone as far as revealing that he once <a href=""http://www.eremedia.com/ere/the-silliness-of-measuring-cost-per-hire-and-how-it-can-reduce-your-strategic-impact/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>banned the measurement of cost per hire</em></a>.</p>, <p>So, I am in fairly esteemed company in my view that the importance of cost per hire is overplayed by the vast majority of talent acquisition leaders and by the organisations in which they inhabit.</p>, <p>First, let’s be clear, I’m not suggesting you should throw the baby out with the bathwater by advocating that cost per hire shouldn’t be measured. It should, but only as part of a wider calculation of the return on investment of the overall recruiting program — and the ROI of each hire.</p>, <p>Placing cost per hire in the right context is perhaps the first step in shifting the mindset of talent acquisition functions from being cost centres to becoming profit centres for their organisations. This is not as fanciful as it seems given studies by the likes of BCG (see Figure 1 below), which found that of 22 HR processes studied, it is excelling at recruiting that provides the biggest differential between leaders and laggards in terms of revenue growth (3.5 times) and profit margin (2.0 times).</p>, <p>Figure 1: Recruiting has the largest influence on revenue growth and profit margin of all HR topics (Source: BCG Study - <a href=""https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/people_management_human_resources_leadership_from_capability_to_profitability/?chapter=2"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">'Realizing the Value of People Management'</a></p>, <p>I recently ran a webcast for LinkedIn and SHRM entitled <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/DavidGreen21/in-recruiting-how-important-is-cost-per-hire-54984609"" target=""_blank""><em>In recruiting, how important is cost per hire?</em></a>, which drew on the above study from BCG as well as other related studies by the likes of Bersin by Deloitte, SHRM, and PwC Saratoga.</p>, <p><strong>1. Cost per hire should be put into context as part of a wider discussion on ROI</strong><span> — evaluating hiring is essentially a blend of three elements – cost, agility, and quality. The weighted importance of each element depends on the type of talent you need to hire, with the general rule being the more senior, scarce, or pivotal the hire, the less important cost per hire becomes.</span></p>, <p>Figure 2 - Deriving value in recruiting involves an optimal balance of quality, agility and cost considerations2.</p>, <p class=""left""><strong>2. If you are going to measure cost per hire, at least do it properly</strong> — calculating cost per hire is actually more complex than it may first appear and too often I’ve seen organisations negate to include factors such as hiring manager time, referral payments, and even recruiting technology costs. <a href=""https://www.shrm.org/TemplatesTools/HRStandards/Documents/11-0096%20HR%20Standards%20Booklet_WEB_revised.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">This study by SHRM</a>, which was led by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyashapiro"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Shapiro</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgadomski"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Gadomski</a> - both acknowledged thought-leaders in this space, is a great place to start.</p>, <p><strong>3. The most mature talent acquisition functions spend 2x more per hire than organisations with the lowest maturity</strong><span> — yes, you read this correctly. A </span><a href=""https://www.bersin.com/Practice/Detail.aspx?id=18430"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">study by Bersin by Deloitte</a><span> ranked over 500 organisations into four levels based on the maturity of their talent acquisition functions. The headline finding was that the most mature (and by extension the best performing) spent on average two times more per hire than those organisations ranked as the least mature.</span></p>, <p><strong>4. The extra investment pays off</strong><span> — the Bersin study also found that the most mature talent acquisition functions enjoyed 40 percent less new-hire attrition and 20 percent faster time to fill than their lowest maturity brethren.</span></p>, <p>Figure 3 - the most mature recruiting functions spend 2x more per hire, but the extra investment pays dividends (Source - Bersin by Deloitte)</p>, <p>To explore what this means in dollar terms through a worked example of two similar companies - one adopting a one-dimensional cost-per-hire focused approach and the other an approach that promotes quality of hire and agility over cost, head over to the bible for recruiters that is ERE by clicking on the following link: <a href=""http://www.eremedia.com/ere/relegating-cost-per-hire-to-its-rightful-place/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Relegating Cost Per Hire to its rightful place</strong></a>.</p>, <p>______________________________________________________</p>, <p> <em><strong>About the author</strong></em></p>, <p> <em><strong>David</strong> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics and the future of work.

David R. Green,"May 3, 2016",Key takeaways from People Analytics 2016 (#PA16LON),https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/key-takeaways-from-people-analytics-2016-david-green/,"[<p>For the second consecutive year, I had the honour of opening and co-chairing <strong><a href=""https://tucana-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tucana’s People Analytics Conference</a></strong> (#PA16LON) in London, which has quickly established itself as the largest gathering of analytics practitioners in the HR space in Europe. </p>, <p>Here are my key takeaways from a splendid two days:</p>, <p><strong>1. Interest levels in People Analytics are going through the roof</strong></p>, <p>Recent surveys by the likes of <a href=""http://www-935.ibm.com/services/c-suite/study/studies/chro-study/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">IBM</a> and <a href=""http://dupress.com/articles/people-analytics-in-hr-analytics-teams/?per=17436"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Deloitte</a> confirmed the rise in the adoption of people analytics by organisations across the globe. If anything, #PA2016LON suggested that interest levels are rising even faster. 330 attendees from 196 companies and 26 countries attended over the course of the two days – that’s twice as many attendees as in 2015. Is HR ready to grasp the opportunity to move the function forwards, which analytics offers? </p>, <p><strong>2. HR capability remains the (biggest?) challenge to progress</strong></p>, <p>A number of speakers commented that HR capability remains the biggest blocker to progress. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a> (and he is a CHRO, so is well-placed to comment) was particularly compelling and verbose in articulating some of the dysfunctional HR habits that impede analytics. Much has been spoken about analytics and insight based decision-making in HR. Less has been realised. Perhaps it’s time for the talking to stop and the doing to begin. As Berry so perfectly describes it, analytics should be the “GPS of HR”. There’s no excuse for not starting the journey.</p>, <p>Mark Berry - visiting the UK for the first time and wowing the #PA16LON audience</p>, <p><strong>3. People Analytics must report to the CHRO…</strong></p>, <p>Every speaker in the sessions I chaired who covered where the analytics function should report were unanimous in that it should fall under the auspices of the CHRO. Otherwise, it risks being lost, marginalised, under-resourced and is likely to be restricted to focusing on HR rather than business issues. These were certainly some of the key outcomes of the lively panel session I chaired with <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ben-nicholas-0228736"" target=""_blank"">Ben Nicholas</a> and <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/lindak3"" target=""_blank"">Linda Kennedy</a>. <strong><em><a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/hr-analytics-you-report-to-the-chro-period/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">This blog</a></em></strong> by <a href=""https://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> of iNostix by Deloitte captures it perfectly. If analytics is to become a core part of HR’s delivery, then it has to report into and be driven by the CHRO…</p>, <p class=""center""><em>Moderating the panel with R-L Max Blumberg, Ben Nicholas (GSK) and Linda Kennedy (SIG)</em></p>, <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>…unless it sits outside HR</strong></p>, <p>The only exception to the <em>‘…must report to the CHRO’</em> rule is where people analytics does not sit within HR but is part of an enterprise wide analytics team. <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/sallyldillon"" target=""_blank"">Sally Dillon</a> from Aviva, who has previously led the insurance giant’s HR Analytics team, explained how creating an enterprise wide function had enabled her team to combine people data with other business data to drive performance improvements across the business. Like other successful analytics functions I’ve seen based outside HR (e.g. LinkedIn and Chevron), Aviva avoid the danger of people data being forgotten because there is a dotted line between the function and the HR leader.</p>, <p>L-R Jonathan Ferrar (IBM) and Sally Dillon (Aviva)</p>, <p><strong>5. Focus on the business as opposed to HR for HR</strong></p>, <p>In his keynote, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> presented research from <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">his forthcoming book</a> on the practices of some of the leading practitioners of people analytics around the world. One of his findings is that there are seven main forces driving the demand for analytics initiatives (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below). The two most common are Cost (second) and HR for HR (top of the list). Whilst cost-led initiatives are understandable and logical even in helping to create business impact, initiatives that are restricted to HR are less so. The big opportunity for HR with analytics is not to justify for example the ROI of the training budget, but to provide insights on some of the big challenges facing the business such as improving sales performance or increasing the number of patents. This is what captures the attention of CXO.</p>, <p>Figure 1: People Analytics - Seven Forces of Demand (Source - Jonathan Ferrar)</p>, <p><strong>6. Develop the right business questions and hypotheses</strong></p>, <p>Ferrar also described his eight steps of the analytics process (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below), highlighting that the first two steps (identifying the right business questions and hypotheses) and the last two (storytelling and change management) are sadly too often neglected at the expense of the actual data gathering and analyses. Identifying the right business questions and working with the business to develop hypotheses as to what could be the root causes are key to defining and focusing work on what is actually important to the business. If there is no business impact, what is the point of expending effort?</p>, <p class=""center""><em>Figure 2: Eight-step Analytics methodology (Source - Jonathan Ferrar)</em></p>, <p><strong>7. Storytelling is absolutely critical</strong></p>, <p>Identifying the right business questions to work on is one key step, crunching and analysing data is another but perhaps the most important part of the analytics process is storytelling. Creating convincing stories that are insightful and compel senior leaders to take action and/or change course are fundamental as otherwise all the hard work and analysis will go to waste. Once the go-ahead has been given for action, the final critical step is effective change management. These final steps are two reasons (business problem definition is another) why a high degree of core consultancy skills is present in the overwhelming majority of mature people analytics functions I have had the good fortune to encounter.</p>, <p><strong>8. There’s got to be something in it for employees</strong></p>, <p>It was refreshing to hear a number of speakers explain how their analytics initiatives were equally targeted at employee as well as business benefit. Whilst people analytics should provide insights that help business leaders make better business decisions to improve performance, there should also be an equal focus on making work better for employees. Two great examples came from <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> of Cisco (see more in <a href=""http://diginomica.com/2015/10/14/ciscos-got-talent-for-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this article</a>) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/subhadra-dutta-ph-d-1314918"" target=""_blank"">Subhadra Dutta</a> of Twitter, who by applying a strong employee focus to their initiatives are reaping dividends in the areas of employee mobility/development and engagement respectively. The more employees can see the benefits of what’s in it for them, the more they will be happy to contribute to and allow their organisations to derive insights from their data.</p>, <p>(L-R) Ian Bailie (Cisco) and Subhadra Dutta (Twitter) </p>, <p><strong>9. Recognition is important</strong></p>, <p>As people analytics is an emerging area of HR, it is important to recognise those vendors and practitioners that are moving the space forward. The People Analytics Awards, expertly chaired by <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/eugeneburke"" target=""_blank"">Eugene Burke</a>, proved to be a perfect forum and congratulations must go to the winners, who were as follows:</p>, <p><strong>10. There’s some exciting technology in the people analytics space</strong></p>, <p>The Awards and the Exhibition space demonstrated that people analytics continues to be an exciting space in terms of some pretty nifty technology, five that caught my eye in between chairing and networking were:</p>, <p><strong>11.  You can’t see everything…</strong></p>, <p>With three parallel tracks at #PA16LON, it was impossible to see all the sessions – even more so when you are co-chairing! As such, I missed what by all accounts were great sessions from the likes of <a href=""https://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sababeyene"" target=""_blank"">Saba Beyene</a> (Walmart – <a href=""https://www.hrdconnect.com/2016/04/27/what-walmart-learned-from-hr-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">see article here</a>), <a href=""https://ie.linkedin.com/in/cadescloux"" target=""_blank"">Claude-Alain Descloux</a> (LinkedIn), <a href=""https://au.linkedin.com/in/peterhowes"" target=""_blank"">Peter Howes</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcwest"" target=""_blank"">Mike West</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> and <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jude-fletcher-6322b631"" target=""_blank"">Jude Fletcher</a> / <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michael-wilkinson-947b4658"" target=""_blank"">Michael Wilkinson</a> (Nestlé UK). As such it would be great that those who did attend these sessions provide their key takeaways in the comments section of this blog – let’s try and make this as comprehensive resource as possible!</p>, <p><strong>12. A final word for Barry Swales and Tucana</strong></p>, <p>Organising conferences is not an easy undertaking.

David R. Green,"March 21, 2016",A Note To Recruiting Leaders: Reporting Is NOT Analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/note-recruiting-leaders-reporting-analytics-david-green/,"[<p>There’s a lot of talk currently about the use of analytics in recruiting. Unfortunately, in my experience many talent acquisition leaders seem to be confusing analytics with reporting and metrics.</p>, <p>Reporting is not the same as analytics. Dashboards, visualisations, and reports that are thicker than <em>War and Peace</em> are fine, but they are focused on the past, fail to answer <strong><em>why</em></strong> something is happening, and are one-dimensional in comparison to the insights offered through analytics.</p>, <p>As I’ve written previously, <a href=""http://www.eremedia.com/ere/6-steps-to-getting-started-with-analytics-in-recruiting/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>talent acquisition is the ideal shop window for analytics within HR</em></a>. It is typically high volume, comprised of repeatable processes, and filled to the brim with data crying out for insights. Moreover, hiring great people is critical (or should be critical) to the success of any organisation.</p>, <p>The importance of hiring is borne out by <a href=""https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/people_management_human_resources_leadership_from_capability_to_profitability/?chapter=2"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>research from BCG</em></a> (see <em><strong>Figure 1</strong></em> below), which found that of 22 HR processes studied, it is excelling at recruiting that provides the biggest differential between leaders and laggards in terms of revenue growth (3.5 times) and profit margin (2.0 times).</p>, <p class=""center""><em>Figure 1 - Excelling at recruiting enables the most capable organisations to enjoy 3.5 times the revenue growth and 2.0 times the profit margin of their least capable counterparts (Source - BCG)</em></p>, <p>Analytics is the key for talent acquisition leaders to unlock the insights within their respective organisations that can generate the levels of return identified by BCG.</p>, <p>Reporting tells you ""<strong>what happened</strong>"", but not ""<strong>why it happened</strong>""...</p>, <p>To read the remainder of this article, head over to the excellent ERE by clicking on the following link: <strong><a href=""http://www.eremedia.com/ere/a-note-to-recruiting-leaders-reporting-is-not-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">A note to recruiting leaders: Reporting is NOT Analytics</a>.</strong> </p>, <p>_______________________________________________________</p>, <p><strong>About the author</strong></p>, <p><em>David is a respected influencer and commentator on the burgeoning topic of people analytics.

David R. Green,"February 9, 2016",People Analytics goes into orbit – 10 takeaways from #PAFOW 16,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-goes-orbit-10-takeaways-from-pafow-16-david-green/,"[<p>I’ve been fairly bullish about 2016 being the year that <em><a href=""http://blog.hrtecheurope.com/10-reasons-people-analytics-is-set-to-go-into-orbit-in-2016/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">people analytics goes into orbit</a></em>. The first test of this foolhardy bold prediction came at the recent ninth edition of the People Analytics &amp; The Future of Work conference in San Francisco, organised by the <strong><em><a href=""http://talentstrategyinstitute.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Strategy Institute</a></em></strong> and skilfully moderated by head honcho and founder <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a></em>. </p>, <p>My confidence was imbued throughout an engrossing two days. Here are my key takeaways from the conference: </p>, <p><strong>1. People Analytics is an opportunity AND a responsibility for HR</strong></p>, <p>Al captured the mood perfectly in his opening remarks on day 1. As well as stating that analytics represents a significant opportunity for HR, Al extended this to analytics being a responsibility for HR to help leaders make better decisions. These decisions should not just be to improve financial and business performance either, but also to optimise work for employees too. There is nothing to disagree with there.</p>, <p><strong>2. People Analytics is even more important than we thought</strong></p>, <p>Al’s opening gambit set the scene perfectly for <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a></em>, who in presenting the findings of <em><a href=""http://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin by Deloitte</a></em>’s extensive research (<em>see Slideshare below of a public version of the slides Josh presented</em>) expressed his view that people analytics was even more important than we had thought. Why? Because the key challenges facing business leaders: retention, culture and engagement can all be informed by the astute application of people analytics.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" data-li-src=""//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/sib0bdvswg8qgi"" frameborder=""0"" height=""534.5882352941177"" scrolling=""no"" src=""about:blank"" width=""640""></iframe></p>, <p><strong>3. Analytics in HR is no longer stuck in neutral</strong></p>, <p>Consequently, Josh reaffirmed his confidence that exponential growth in people analytics is set to occur this year (phew!) and is no longer <em><a href=""http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-capital/articles/people-and-hr-analytics-human-capital-trends-2015.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">stuck in neutral</a></em>. He added that this growth is likely to lead to an explosion in the vendor space as HR crosses the chasm from early into widespread adoption. This view of imminent growth was reinforced by research data presented by <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinoakes"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Oakes</a></em> of <em><a href=""http://www.i4cp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">i4CP</a></em>, which included findings that executive commitment to people analytics and budgets are both rising. The i4CP study, which will be released shortly, also found that high performing organisations were 2.5 times more effective at leveraging diversity for business outcomes than their low performing counterparts.</p>, <p><strong>4. The focus must be on the business rather than HR</strong></p>, <p>The practitioners that relayed their stories over the two days were unequivocal in the focus of people analytics functions needing to be on solving business problems rather than justifying the ROI of individual talent programmes. This bodes well for the continued growth of people analytics as it is by solving business problems that additional budget and recognition will be achieved<em>. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a></em>’s approach at Chevron (see Figure below) as to how his team prioritise initiatives to work on (based on <em><a href=""https://www.cebglobal.com/shl/images/uploads/linkau13-CLC-The-Analytics-Era.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">research by CEB</a></em>) has particular resonance in how to focus effort.</p>, <p><strong>5. People Analytics doesn’t necessarily need to reside in HR</strong></p>, <p>Bersin’s assertion that people analytics teams may evolve either into company wide analytics practices and/or be situated outside HR proved to be prescient. The people analytics teams at Chevron and LinkedIn both report into operations even though they are aligned to HR. This makes sense given that a lot of the work being done is to solve business rather than HR problems e.g. identifying safety issues, social monitoring to anticipate risk, improving sales productivity etc and therefore require a myriad of data sources – HR data being just one element. Whether housed inside or outside HR, the most effective people analytics teams appear to be operating as consulting functions – identifying, analysing, providing insights and recommending actions on challenges facing the business.    </p>, <p><strong>6. Getting started: Clarity of vision is key</strong></p>, <p>Many of the speakers described the similar challenges they had faced when establishing their people analytics teams. These included achieving focus (on the business problem as opposed to HR), capability (analytical and storytelling skills within HR) and credibility (data quality, reporting vs. insights). Whilst each organisation has undergone a different journey to overcome these challenges, one commonality that struck home was that they all had a clear vision of what they were trying to achieve. Three that carried particular impact were outlined by <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-deneau-36b9201"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Deneau</a></em> of Intuit, <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a></em> of Google and RJ Milnor and are provided in the Figure below.</p>, <p><strong>7. Developing scale: create a company-wide analytics mindset</strong></p>, <p>Once the analytics function is established and has demonstrated success, the challenge of scale rears its ugly head as demand from the business suddenly spikes. A number of the speakers explained how they had countered this by creating and training an analytics mindset to a much wider group. RJ Milnor of Chevron described how a three-tiered training course had helped create an extended global team of c250 people. <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-walter-3baa8a9"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Walter</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/antony-ebelle-ebanda-07642b"" target=""_blank"">Antony Ebelle-Ebanda</a></em> explained how they had followed similar paths at Gap and McGraw Hill Financial respectively whilst <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertolanning"" target=""_blank"">Robert Lanning</a></em> of Tesoro evangelised the importance of developing sustainable career paths for the analytics team. Not only do such approaches address the question of scale, but they accelerate the cultural shift required to make people analytics a critical and sustainable component of an organisation’s business strategy.</p>, <p><strong>8. People Analytics initiatives can inform product strategy…</strong></p>, <p>One of my favourite examples of the value of people analytics came in <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White’s</a></em> presentation of how LinkedIn had used analytics to improve its identification and prioritisation of critical talent for engineering recruiting. The analytics team worked with product and talent acquisition to create a four-box prioritisation model that proved so successful in its nine-month pilot that an adapted version will be part of an upcoming release of LinkedIn Recruiter. So, that’s better hiring and additional product revenue from just one initiative. Wow.</p>, <p><strong>9. …as well as business transformation and new HR practices too</strong></p>, <p>Other great examples of people analytics came from <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-whiteman-02a8097"" target=""_blank"">Heather Whiteman</a></em> at GE Digital and <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbroderickchicago"" target=""_blank"">Chris Broderick</a></em> of IBM. People analytics has formed the backbone of the integrated talent management strategy required to grow GE Digital from 230 to 3,700 people in just four years. Whilst at IBM, soliciting and analysing employee survey responses has informed the design of new employee listening and <em><a href=""http://www.techinsider.io/ibm-changes-its-employee-reviews-2016-2"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">performance management</a></em> programmes.</p>, <p><strong>10. Smart people, inspiring stories, cool vendors</strong></p>, <p>In his presentation providing examples of the great outcomes Google has derived through people analytics (I particularly liked the work undertaken to understand team effectiveness), Ian O’Keefe advised there were approximately 3,500 people analytics professionals in the US. If the 200 or so of these in the room are anything to go, then the practice of people analytics is in very capable hands. There were plenty of inspiring stories for those either looking to get started or extend the work they are already doing. Moreover, during the vendor show and tell, it is clear that there are a number of great solutions on offer to accelerate progress even quicker. Those that stood out included:<em> <a href=""http://www.vestrics.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ves(tric)s</a>, <a href=""http://www.visier.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Visier</a>, <a href=""https://www.cultureamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Culture Amp</a>, <a href=""http://www.glintinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glint</a>, <a href=""http://www.modernsurvey.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Modern Survey</a>, <a href=""http://www.onemodel.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">One Model</a> and <a href=""http://www.economicmodeling.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">EMSI</a> </em>as well as <a href=""http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/talent-insights"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">I<em>BM's Talent Insights solution</em></a> (see taster below). All in all, from practitioner to analyst and vendor alike, I sensed a collective resolve to make a difference.</p>, <p></p>, <p><strong>A final word for Al Adamsen and the TSI team... </strong></p>, <p>Finally, huge congratulations to Al and his team for hosting such a marvellous conference.

Green,"January 26, 2016",Seven lessons HR can learn from David Bowie,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/seven-lessons-hr-can-learn-from-david-bowie-david-green/,"[<p>Always experimenting and the master of reinvention, David Bowie was the Mozart of our time. Throughout a career that spanned 50 years, Bowie emerged as perhaps the most iconic and influential figure that popular music has ever seen.</p>, <p>Bowie’s phenomenal run of 12 trailblazing albums in 11 years from 1970’s ‘The Man Who Sold the World’ to 1980’s ‘Scary Monsters &amp; Super Creeps’ is a period of creativity that will probably never be matched.</p>, <p>Even at the end, with the release of his 25th studio album ‘Blackstar’ on his 69th birthday, Bowie was still capable of springing surprises and making a genuinely groundbreaking record – one that has sadly proved to be his epitaph, albeit a wonderfully triumphant one.</p>, <p></p>, <p>The first draft of this blog, providing lessons that HR could learn from Bowie, was written on the weekend of Blackstar’s release and I had planned to post it on the 11th January. That was the fateful day of course when the world woke up to hear that Bowie had lost his 18 month battle against cancer – a fight that had been hidden from all but his closest friends and family.</p>, <p>Like many of my generation (and the one before), the music of David Bowie soundtracked my life, but he wasn’t always my musical idol. As someone who became a teenager in the mid-1980s, whilst I liked some of Bowie’s music from that decade it was only when I was introduced to his seventies output (thanks to Live Aid and school chum Ian Grace) that Bowie became an immortal in my book.</p>, <p></p>, <p>So, here we are at the second version of this article, which as well as being my personal tribute to the man who introduced us all to Ziggy Stardust, is also designed to be a clarion call for human resources leaders – well, this is supposed to be a blog about HR and people analytics after all.</p>, <p>There are many lessons that HR (and perhaps all of us) can learn from David Bowie – here are just seven:</p>, <p><strong>1. Borrow from others, but be yourself</strong></p>, <p>The list of artists Bowie drew inspiration from is endless. It included Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground, The Stooges and Kraftwerk as well as musical genres as diverse as jazz, soul, folk, rock n roll, electronic and so-called ‘Krautrock’. The key to Bowie’s genius is that he combined these influences with his own interpretation and ideas to create something fresh and original each time. In HR, there has been a tendency for some organisations to simply copy talent programmes from others. Just because it works for Google, it doesn’t mean it will work for you - it probably won't. By all means learn from the approach taken by others, but then apply this, adapt it and make it relevant to your own organisation.</p>, <p></p>, <p><strong>2. Hire, engage and retain the best talent</strong></p>, <p>Throughout his long career, Bowie proved adept at hiring and engaging great talent to collaborate with, hone his ideas and take his music to the next level. From Mick Ronson and the other Spiders from Mars to long-standing collaborators like Carlos Alomar and Mike Garson as well as producers Brian Eno and Tony Visconti, Bowie understood the power of working with the best talent available. Talent should be the lifeblood of any organisation. Businesses rely on HR and talent acquisition functions to inject the right talent at the right time. It is talent that drives the top line, executes strategy, creates innovation and delivers transformational change. Picking the right people to hire as Bowie invariably did can make the difference between success and failure.</p>, <p></p>, <p><strong>3. Be open to collaborating with and giving back to others</strong></p>, <p>Closely related to Bowie’s sixth sense for picking the best talent was his ability to collaborate widely with others. Fame, his duet with John Lennon gave him his first US number one in 1975, whilst teaming up with Brian Eno for the Berlin trilogy of albums produced perhaps his most innovative pieces of work. Importantly, Bowie also gave back to others. He produced Lou Reed’s best selling album Transformer, resurrected the career of Mott the Hoople and repaid the inspiration Iggy Pop had provided to him by producing his albums The Idiot and Lust for Life. Collaboration – or Open Source HR – provides the opportunity to accelerate the growth of the HR function whilst at the same time giving back to others. Google is doing this with <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work</a>, Ambrosia Vertesi’s and Lars Schmidt’s <a href=""http://hros.co/#what-is-hros"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">#HROS initiative</a>  takes this to the next level and I know of a number of organisations that are working together to further the work they have already individually done in the field of people analytics. </p>, <p>4. Use Technology as an enabler</p>, <p>Bowie didn’t just harness new technology to produce groundbreaking music (as he did with the Low-Heroes-Lodger trilogy), but also to release and publicise his creative outputs. His internet service BowieNet, which launched in 1998 was light years ahead of other musicians, and he even foretold the disruption that the likes of iTunes would cause to music way back <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaHcOs7mhfU"" target=""_blank"">in an interview with the BBC in 1999</a></em>. Maybe Steve Jobs was watching? Social media was the channel Bowie chose to announce his comeback in 2013, which also took the world by surprise. Rapid development of and investment in HR Technology has reached unprecedented levels. The capability offered through data, analytics and cognitive computing has the potential to help HR functions that harness it effectively to re-emerge and shake off the shackles of its present cost centre obsessed mentality.</p>, <p><strong>5. Be bold, take risks and above all experiment</strong></p>, <p>Perhaps no musician in history has been as consistently bold and experimental as Bowie. Whether it was music, fashion, video, art or even sexuality, Bowie continually pushed the boundaries and created the space for others to follow in his wake. From Ziggy Stardust through the dystopian Diamond Dogs, the plastic soul of Young Americans, the Thin White Duke era of Station to Station, the pioneering Berlin trilogy, the trailblazing video for Ashes to Ashes, joining the mainstream with Lets Dance and ultimately his rebirth in 2013, Bowie took more risks than Evel Knievel. The majority of HR functions should look to emulate this boldness to expand its reach and take advantage of changing employee attitudes, enhanced technology and analytics to create real and lasting change within their organisations. Ultimately, this combination of new thinking and new technology should enable HR to create positive business outcomes through people insights and elevate its profile irrevocably.</p>, <p></p>, <p><strong>6. Don’t be afraid to fail</strong></p>, <p>Bowie didn’t always succeed. Interestingly, the one time he played it safe and didn’t take a risk led to his career low – 1987’s Never Let Me Down – perhaps proving T S Eliot’s adage true that <em>""only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far it is possible to go""</em>. HR is not traditionally a function that has taken risks – indeed it has policed others in the organisation to prevent them from doing so. But times have changed and the emergence of practices such as people analytics deman fresh thinking and experimentation. Not every project will succeed and not every hypothesis will be proved, but learn from failure and move on emboldened to tackle the next initiative.</p>, <p><strong>7. Inspire – HR can be heroes too</strong></p>, <p>The reaction to Bowie’s death attests to what an inspirational figure he was. For my money, he is the most influential figure in the history of popular music. Certainly, I don’t remember as significant an outpouring of emotion since John Lennon was murdered. Bowie inspired and will continue to inspire many. Whilst businesses in general or HR functions cannot ever hope to capture the imagination in quite as monumental a way, HR can in the words of one of Bowie’s most iconic songs be ‘heroes” within their organisations. Providing insights on people that lead to highly engaged and high performing employees and ultimately positive business outcomes is a surefire way of achieving this.</p>, <p></p>, <p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>, <p>There are many lessons that HR leaders can take from the life and career of David Bowie – these are just the seven that I have come up with for this article. It’ll be interesting to read any others that people may have in the comments section below. For me, the world of music will never quite be the same without the genius of Bowie, but by heavens he has left a marvellous and timeless legacy.</p>, <p>_____________________________________________________</p>, <p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>, <p><em>David is a respected influencer and commentator on the burgeoning topic of people analytics.

David R. Green,"January 21, 2016",Winning a LinkedIn Power Profile - How I (think) I did it...,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/winning-linkedin-power-profile-how-i-think-did-david-green/,"[<p>Being British, I’m always mildly embarrassed at the prospect of any accolade (not that they come often), and this was certainly the case on Tuesday this week when I was invited to LinkedIn UK’s London HQ to receive an award as a UK Power Profile in HR for 2015. </p>, <p>What is a ‘LinkedIn Power Profile’ I hear you ask. I must admit that I was wondering that too as Google for once did not provide all the answers. It seemed that Power Profiles had only been awarded previously to LinkedIn members in India and Australia. Perhaps these prizes were restricted to LinkedIn members in cricket playing nations only?</p>, <p>As it transpires, LinkedIn Power Profiles have been awarded to UK professionals who were most viewed on LinkedIn in 2015 and who are using the platform to best effect. The awards covered six categories: Leaders (including ‘proper’ powerful individuals like Sir Richard Branson, James Caan and some bloke called David Cameron), Finance, Technology, Marketing &amp; Advertising, Students and good old HR with 10 recipients per category – see here for more detail and the winners in each category. </p>, <p>The UK Power Profile winners celebrate at LinkedIn's London HQ</p>, <p>The ceremony coincided with LinkedIn announcing a pretty notable milestone themselves in the UK. They now have <em><a href=""http://blog.linkedin.com/2016/01/19/uk-20-million/"" target=""_blank"">20 million members in the UK</a> </em>– that’s nearly 60% of the UK’s working and student population. LinkedIn has no intention of stopping there either – their vision is to create opportunity for every single member of the global workforce. A lofty goal maybe, but hey what’s wrong with aiming high?</p>, <p>Like many of the fellow winners I spoke to I was a bit bemused by the whole affair and for the life of me couldn’t quite understand how I had made the cut. My beloved wife Sara provided the first clue commenting on my arrival home that it was obviously because I spend an inordinate amount of time on LinkedIn. I confess there is probably a heavy dose of truth in that.</p>, <p>However, having given the matter some thought I’ve come up with six tips that may help others attain the ‘Power Profile’ moniker:</p>, <p><strong>1. Write your own content</strong></p>, <p>The number of views my profile received rose significantly when I started writing blogs on LinkedIn Pulse. I was fortunate enough to be one of the first users able to use this application and over the last two years have posted close to 40 blogs. As well as being something I enjoy, writing on Pulse (and other HR blogs like HR Tech World and ERE) has enabled people to find me who otherwise wouldn’t have known I existed. Consequently, it has been of huge benefit to me from a business perspective. Any tips to 'beat' the LinkedIn Pulse algorithm will be gratefully received! </p>, <p>2. Share and curate content</p>, <p>Similarly, I am an active user of the ‘Share an update’ feature. I’m not suggesting this is the only way, but my tips here are:</p>, <p><strong>3. Be passionate about what you do</strong></p>, <p>Part of my ‘success’ is likely down to the fact that I work in what I believe is the most exciting part of HR – the burgeoning people analytics space. I passionately believe that the future of HR will be underpinned by data and analytics. Analytics is reasonably new to HR and adoption levels are not high, which means that people are curious to learn more. LinkedIn is a great platform to broaden your knowledge and if you are passionate about what you do and share that fact then you are likely to attract inquisitive LinkedIn members to your profile.</p>, <p><strong>4. Grow the number of relevant connections you have</strong></p>, <p>As the infamous showman and serial hoaxer P.T Barnum is reputed to have remarked, ‘nothing draws a crowd like a crowd’, and that is certainly the case when it comes to increasing your profile views on LinkedIn. I accept and request connections with relevant people in my industry, whilst the articles I write and curate mean that a number of people have chosen to ‘follow’ me – which I am naturally very grateful for. I find the ‘People You May Know’ feature useful and as the number of connections increases, so does the number of shares, comments, views and connection requests.</p>, <p><strong>5. Regularly update your profile with interesting content</strong></p>, <p>Think of your LinkedIn profile as more than your online resume – it is your window to the business world. Make your profile standout and update it regularly. Use the functionality on offer to add links, video, detail your achievements and describe what you do and are passionate about, and remember a little bit of humour is absolutely fine. I know from analysing the number of views that follow an update that not only do more people flock to your profile, but the number of career and business opportunities significantly rise.</p>, <p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Give back</strong></p>, <p>LinkedIn is not about taking – like any form of networking what you give back is far more important. I try and help others whenever possible – whether they are looking for help with their career, want some advice or by simply sharing or liking LinkedIn articles and updates from my connections. The benefits of helping people may not give immediate benefit to you, but invariably it does pay off in the long run. In my view giving back is also decent, ethical and makes you feel better about yourself, so where’s the harm?</p>, <p>Thank you LinkedIn</p>, <p>LinkedIn has its detractors and occasionally the criticism it gets is justified – no one (and no company) is perfect after all. Nevertheless, I am happy to admit that LinkedIn and especially Pulse has helped my career, enabled me to build a profile as an influencer in the people analytics space and expanded my network. As such, I am a big advocate of LinkedIn and probably like many of its users, can’t imagine a world without it. My thanks to everyone at LinkedIn UK for this recognition and for hosting me at your splendid London HQ this week – keep up the good work!</p>, <p><strong>A big well done…</strong></p>, <p>…to my fellow winners especially those in the <em><a href=""https://lists.linkedin.com/power-profiles/uk/industry/hr"" target=""_blank"">HR category</a></em> many of whom have been a personal inspiration to me: in no particular order congratulations <em>to <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jennifercandee"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Candee</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/johnnycampbell"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Campbell</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mlbuckland"" target=""_blank"">Matt Buckland</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ruthpenfold"" target=""_blank"">Ruthie Penfold</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hunglee"" target=""_blank"">Hung Lee</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/joeburridge"" target=""_blank"">Joe Burridge</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/margaretbuj"" target=""_blank"">Margaret Buj</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/caseyamend"" target=""_blank"">Casey Amend</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/michelleflynn"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Flynn</a></em> - I am humbled to be in such great company.</p>, <p><strong>Last but not least...</strong></p>, <p>A huge thank you to my connections and followers.

As well as generating better talent outcomes in terms of leadership pipelines, cost reductions, efficiency gains and mobility, perhaps the most telling finding was that the share prices of these pioneering 14% outpaced the S&amp;P 500 by an average 30% from 2011-14.

David R. Green,"November 11, 2015",The Absurdity of Cost per Hire in Recruiting,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/absurdity-cost-per-hire-recruiting-david-green/,"[<p>I am fortunate to spend a great deal of time working with organisations to design talent acquisition programmes that are intended to drive growth and competitive advantage.</p>, <p>An all too familiar trend I encounter is an over-emphasis on reducing cost per hire to the detriment of other measures such as speed and quality of hire as well as surely the most important metric – new hire performance.</p>, <p>I recently had the pleasure of conducting a webinar (see link to recording at end of this article) on two consecutive days for <em><strong><a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn Talent Solutions</a></strong></em> and the Society for Human Resource Management (<em><strong><a href=""http://www.shrm.org/pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">SHRM</a></strong></em>) on this very subject.</p>, <p>The webinar, which was partly based on a blog I wrote in the summer<em> <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/recruiting-how-important-cost-per-hire-david-green"" target=""_blank"">‘In Recruiting, How Important is Cost per Hire’</a> </em>drew on research (also see links at the end of this article) from the likes of Bersin by Deloitte, Boston Consulting Group and SHRM, and covered the following five nuggets:</p>, <p><strong>1. Cost per hire should be put into context as part of a wider discussion on ROI</strong></p>, <p>Every other function within the business makes decisions based on value – or return on investment – and HR and Recruiting functions need to do the same. As well as Cost, the other two key components of the ROI equation are Agility and Quality as indicated in <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below.  Does the ‘Perfect Balance’ exist? Just like Sir Thomas More’s fictional island of <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Utopia</a></em>, probably not, and to exacerbate the difficulty in achieving the perfect balance, the weighted importance of Cost, Agility and Quality will depend on the type of talent you need to hire. The general rule being the more senior, scarce or pivotal the hire the less important cost per hire becomes.</p>, <p>Figure 1 - what is ROI in recruiting?</p>, <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>If you are going to measure cost per hire, do it properly</strong></p>, <p>Given the importance that the vast majority of organisations place in the Cost per Hire metric, one would think that they would calculate it properly. Regrettably, that invariably isn’t the case in my experience. Calculating Cost per Hire is actually more complex than it may first appear and too often elements like hiring manager time, employee referral payments and yes, even technology costs are omitted from an organisation’s calculation. The webinar highlights a study commissioned by SHRM on establishing a standard for Cost per Hire (see link at end and <em><strong>Figure 2</strong></em>), which is the best work I have seen in this area. This is perhaps not a surprise given it was led by <em><strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyashapiro"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Shapiro</a></strong></em> and <em><strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgadomski"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Gadomski</a></strong></em>, two of the leading lights in the burgeoning area of HR Analytics.</p>, <p>Figure 2 - How to calculate Cost per Hire (Source - 'Standard Formula for individual organisations as taken from SHRM Cost per Hire American National Standard)</p>, <p><strong>3. The most mature talent acquisition functions spend 2x more Cost per Hire than organisations with the lowest maturity</strong></p>, <p>The webinar then highlighted research from <em><strong><a href=""http://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin by Deloitte</a></strong></em>. Their Talent Acquisition Factbook (see link at end of article) provides a series of talent acquisition metrics and trends from c500 organisations. The study benchmarks those firms against each other and ranks their maturity into four levels of performance. Revealingly, the study found that the more mature (and by definition effective) the recruiting function is, the higher the average spend per hire – the difference between the most and least mature organisations is almost twice as much spend per hire. This extra investment translates to organisations with the highest level of maturity enjoying 40% less new-hire attrition and 20% faster time to fill than those with least capability – see <em><strong>Figure 3</strong></em>.</p>, <p>Figure 3 - The most mature talent acquisition functions spend on average nearly two times as much per hire than the least mature (Source - Bersin by Deloitte)</p>, <p><strong>4. Too much emphasis on lowering Cost Per Hire can be more expensive in the long run</strong></p>, <p>Using the findings from the Bersin study together with some other assumptions – see <em><strong>Figure 4</strong></em>, the webinar includes a scenario of two similar organisations – Smart Inc and Dumb Inc – to illustrate how a penny-pinching approach to recruiting can actually prove more expensive and disruptive to the organisation in the final reckoning. Check the webinar to see if it proves to be smart by name and smart by nature.</p>, <p>Figure 4 - Smart Inc. and Dumb Inc. take a completely different approach to investing in their talent acquisition programmes</p>, <p><strong>5. Excelling in recruiting is a key differentiator for the business</strong></p>, <p>It’s not just about the bottom line either. There are several studies that suggest excelling at recruiting can have a direct and positive impact on an organisation’s revenue and profit numbers – the numbers that CXO and investors really care about. The webinar presents findings from <strong><em><a href=""https://www.bcg.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">BCG</a></em></strong> that compares the most capable and least capable companies when it comes to a host of HR topics and looks at the impact it has on revenue growth and profit margin. The difference between the most capable and least capable organizations with regards to recruiting produces some interesting figures – see <em><strong>Figure 5</strong></em>. The most capable organizations enjoy 3.5 times more revenue growth and 2.0 times more profit margin than their less capable brethren, and it is recruiting that tops the league table amongst the 22 HR topics that were studied.</p>, <p>Figure 5 - Excelling at recruiting enables the most capable organisations to enjoy 3.5 times the revenue growth and 2.0 times the profit margin of their least capable counterparts (Source - BCG)</p>, <p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>, <p>In summary, whatever the size of your organisation – and whether you are a recruiter, hiring manager, head of Talent Acquisition, CHRO or business leader, if you make the right level of investment you will likely enjoy the benefits of having a highly capable and highly performing talent acquisition function, which will provide tangible top and bottom line benefit to the organisation.

David R. Green,"October 22, 2015",10 tips to get started with People Analytics,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-tips-get-started-people-analytics-david-green/,"[<p>Despite being one of the most talked about concepts in HR and predictions from industry luminaries like Josh Bersin that 2015 would see its widespread adoption, take-up of HR/Talent/People/Workforce analytics is still remarkably slow.</p>, <p>Indeed, just this week, Bersin posted a blog entitled <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-takes-off-ten-things-weve-learned-josh-bersin?trk=hp-feed-article-title-share"" target=""_blank"">'People Analytics Takes Off - Ten Things We've Learned'</a></em> where he addresses this very issue of a market that has seemingly stalled.</p>, <p>Bersin convincingly argues that like pretty much every other business trend, growth does not come in a straight line but exponentially. Indeed, as the Figure below suggest significant adoption of analytics within the HR function may not be too far away.</p>, <p>The case for people analytics is pretty much irrefutable, so why the slow uptake? From speaking to practitioners it seems the answer may lie in a combination of fear (as in too much) and knowledge (as in too little).</p>, <p>How can we conquer this two-pronged challenge? Well, this article is intended to signpost 10 tips to help the budding HR analytics aspirant get started.</p>, <p><strong>1. Read some books</strong></p>, <p>There are a plethora of books on getting familiar with analytics – here are three to get you started: <a href=""https://hbr.org/product/keeping-up-with-the-quants-your-guide-to-understan/an/11177-HBK-ENG"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>‘Keeping up with the Quants’</em></a> by Tom Davenport – widely recognised as the Godfather of analytics; <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/HR-Analytics-The-What-Why/dp/1492739162/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392393970&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=HR+analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>‘HR Analytics: The what, why and how’</em></a> by Tracey Smith; Human Capital Analytics: <em><a href=""http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118466764.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">'How to Harness the Potential of Your Organization's Greatest Asset'</a></em> by Gene Pease, Boyce Byerly and Jac Fitz-enz.

One of the key challenges encountered by both professors is why more firms haven’t adopted this. Grant describes the conundrum he is attempting to resolve as thus: “Why don’t more organisations do this? And how can you get senior leaders to realise that just because sometimes these variables are hard to measure doesn’t mean you shouldn’t bring better science to them?”</p>, <p><strong>HR Analytics – 10 years behind </strong>| <a href=""https://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> | <a href=""http://blog.hrtecheurope.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech World blog</a> <em>(read <a href=""http://blog.hrtecheurope.com/hr-analytics-10-years-behind/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">full article</a>)</em></p>, <p>Grant and Massey concede that HR is playing catch up with other functions like IT, Marketing and Finance in using data to inform its decision making. Our second article by Luk Smeyers of iNostix on <em><a href=""http://blog.hrtecheurope.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech World</a></em> goes further, suggesting that HR is 10 years behind. Smeyers argues this should be a wake-up call for HR and emphasises the importance of a strong business case and executive sponsorship in order to get analytics in HR off the ground. <em>You may want also want to check out iNostix’s excellent <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/blog/en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Analytics Insights blog</a>.</em></p>, <p><strong>Starting the Workforce Analytics Journey – the first 100 days</strong> | IBM (<em>download <a href=""https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/iwm/web/signup.do?source=swg-US_Lotus_WebMerch&amp;S_PKG=ov37199&amp;S_TACT=C28004HW&amp;dynform=19149&amp;lang=en_US"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">full white paper</a></em>)</p>, <p>Getting started is also the theme in an excellent recent white paper from IBM, which features contributions from acknowledged HR analytics thought leaders like <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyashapiro"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Shapiro</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jonathan-ferrar/0/928/890"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>.

It reports on a joint study between Harvard Law School and the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute (IRRCi) into the growing interest from the investment community into the correlation between human capital and financial outcomes such as return on equity, return on investment and profit margins. The study establishes a meaningful connection between the two implying that “companies with a convincing HR story and strong data to back it up are likely to receive a welcome reception from many institutional investors.” <em>Read the entire <a href=""http://irrcinstitute.org/pdf/FINAL-Human-Capital-Materiality-April-23-2015.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘The Materiality of Human Capital to Corporate Financial Performance’</a> study.</em></p>, <p>“Companies with a convincing HR story and strong data to back it up are likely to receive a welcome reception from many institutional investors.” Aaron Bernstein, from Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program</p>, <p><strong>In recruiting, how important is cost per hire? | </strong><em><a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/davidrgreen"" target=""_blank"">David Green</a> (read <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/recruiting-how-important-cost-per-hire-david-green?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">the full article</a>)</em></p>, <p>We started with Josh Bersin this week, so perhaps it is also appropriate to finish with an article by David Green (not sure who he is) that is part-inspired by <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/blog/post/Benchmarking-Talent-Acquisition-Increasing-Spend2c-Cost-Per-Hire2c-and-Time-to-Fill.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">research from Bersin by Deloitte</a>.

David R. Green,"June 8, 2015","In recruiting, how important is Cost Per Hire?",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/recruiting-how-important-cost-per-hire-david-green/,"[<p>I spend a considerable amount of my time helping organisations improve the performance of their recruiting functions. </p>, <p>As I wrote in a previous article (<em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141204082733-12091643-time-to-cure-cost-per-hire-myopia?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">see here</a></em>), I find the overemphasis on cost per hire to the detriment of everything else surprising. Whilst cost should of course be part of the equation, on its own it is one-dimensional.  Every other function in the business makes decisions based on value (or ROI) and so should HR. Cheaper does not necessarily mean better – particularly when it comes to acquiring talent. The right question should be ‘<em><strong>what is the level of investment that will exponentially provide the best outcomes</strong></em>’.</p>, <p>It seems those clever chaps and chapesses at <a href=""http://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin by Deloitte</a> agree. In <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/blog/post/Benchmarking-Talent-Acquisition-Increasing-Spend2c-Cost-Per-Hire2c-and-Time-to-Fill.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a recent study</a> they found that organisations at the highest level of maturity (classified as “optimised talent acquisition functions”) spend two times more per hire ($6,465 vs $3,258) compared to those with the lowest impact (“reactive tactical recruiting functions”). Yes, you read that correctly - two times cost per hire.</p>, <p>And to paraphrase Shakespeare’s Henry V what do these few, these happy few, this band of brothers get for their larger investment in talent acquisition? A better return. A much better return with optimised talent acquisition functions enjoying 40% lower new-hire attrition (10% vs 17%) and 20% faster time-to-fill (44 vs 55 days) compared with reactive tactical recruiting functions.</p>, <p>This seems a perfect opportunity for a little maths using the data in the Bersin study along with a number of other widely held assumptions.</p>, <p><strong>Smart Inc. and Dummy Inc – a battle of opposites</strong></p>, <p>So, let’s take two identical firms. Both have annual revenues of $1bn, employ 10,000 staff and need to hire 1,000 new employees in the forthcoming year. The first, <strong><em>Smart Inc.</em></strong> has a recruiting strategy firmly based on Bersin’s optimised talent acquisition function whilst the second firm - (yes, you’ve guessed it) <strong><em>Dummy Inc.</em></strong> is cost obsessed and believes its reactive tactical recruiting function is more than sufficient.</p>, <p><strong>First blood to Dummy Inc.</strong></p>, <p>Naturally, when it comes to a pure cost comparison, Smart Inc’s annual outlay on hiring is significantly higher than Dummy Inc. as the Figure below – using the values in the Bersin study – illustrates.</p>, <p>What could the additional outlay incorporate? Leaving aside whether that involves partnering with a recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) firm or building in-house (one doesn’t want to be accused of bias) the extra investment could include initiatives to attract passive talent, harness predictive analytics and use superior technology – all delivered by high calibre recruiters.</p>, <p><strong>Smart Inc. come roaring back</strong></p>, <p>A good indicator of quality of hire is first-year attrition. An employee leaving — voluntarily or involuntarily — within the first year typically indicates poor selection, poor onboarding or both. Experts from the likes of CEB and PwC Saratoga calculate the average cost of turnover for new hires is equivalent from one to one and a half times salary. The figure is based on direct costs (e.g. recruiter costs, RPO fees, marketing, technology licenses) and indirect costs (e.g. lost productivity, new hire ramp-up, hiring manager time).</p>, <p>For the purposes of our example we’ll assume that the multiplier for both Smart Inc. and Dummy Inc. is 1.25 and that the average salary is $50,000. This translates – see Figure above – to Smart Inc. having over $4m less annual losses due to first-year attrition than Dummy Inc. This means that in comparison to its cost obsessed counterpart, Smart Inc. has already recovered its additional outlay on hiring. Smart by name, smart by nature.</p>, <p><strong>Smart Inc. move further ahead</strong></p>, <p>Finally, let’s look at another key component – agility as expressed by speed of filling vacancies with Smart Inc., according to the Bersin study, taking on average 44 days to fill a role, and Dummy Inc. lagging behind on 55 days. If we look at the comparative potential net lost revenue opportunity, we see Smart Inc. is the daddy once again with $2.5m less net lost opportunity revenue than the wooden spoon wielding Dummy Inc.</p>, <p>The result</p>, <p>You get what you pay for. Smart Inc. may have invested $3.2m more than Dummy Inc. for an identical number of hires, but with $4.4m less losses due to first-year attrition and $2.5m less net lost opportunity through faster time to fill, it has proved a far more astute investor. Other qualitative measures will only exacerbate the savviness of Smart Inc.</p>, <p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>, <p>It’s time for HR and Recruiting leaders – and the vendors that support them – to evolve the conversation beyond cost per hire. Studies like the one featured here by Bersin help those pioneering this approach as does the research from Boston Consulting Group (<em><a href=""https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/people_management_human_resources_leadership_from_capability_to_profitability/?chapter=2"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">see here</a></em>) included in <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141204082733-12091643-time-to-cure-cost-per-hire-myopia?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">my previous cost per hire article</a></em>.</p>, <p>The BCG research (see Figure above) concluded that <em><strong>companies adept at recruiting enjoyed 3.5 times the revenue growth and 2.0 times the profit margin</strong></em> of their less foresighted peers. If that doesn’t shift the attention to outcomes over cost, nothing will.</p>, <p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>, <p>David is a Director at <a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo</a>, #1 RPO on the Baker's Dozen for global breadth and quality of service.

Green,"May 13, 2015",7 HR Analytics firms to watch,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/7-hr-analytics-firms-watch-david-green/,"[<p>After years of talking, the penny finally seems to have dropped with regards to data based decision making in HR.

David R. Green,"April 28, 2015",Key Takeaways from #PeopleAnalytics15,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/key-takeaways-from-peopleanalytics15-david-green/,"[<p>I had the honour of co-chairing the excellent People Analytics conference in London last week, which was brilliantly curated and executed by Barry Swales and the Tucana team.</p>, <p>Here are my key takeaways from the two days:</p>, <p><em><strong>1. People Analytics has moved from the ‘why’ to the ‘how’…</strong></em></p>, <p>In my opening remarks I took a quick straw poll to see how many agreed with Josh Bersin’s prediction (<em><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/02/01/geeks-arrive-in-hr-people-analytics-is-here/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">see here</a></em>) that analytics will go mainstream in HR in 2015.  Only a brave few (let it never be said that HR folk aren’t a sceptical bunch) were prepared to raise their hands. The optimists were overwhelmingly outvoted by those who believe that this is another false dawn. In one sense though the conference indicated that Bersin may end up being right as the two days showed that the conversation has shifted from the ‘why’ to the ‘how’, and just in case there was still any doubt…</p>, <p> <em><strong>2.</strong> <strong>…the case for data driven HR is irrefutable</strong></em></p>, <p>When the likes of the CIPD invest time, money and resources on an initiative such as <a href=""http://www.cipd.co.uk/research/valuing-your-talent/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valuing Your Talent</a> you know that Bersin is likely to be vindicated eventually. If there is still any doubt about the case for data driven HR, the panel discussion led by <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/anthony-hesketh/4/4b8/337"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Hesketh</a> (author of Valuing Your Talent) dispelled it. As <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/louise-fisher/1/514/85b"" target=""_blank"">Louise Fisher</a> (HR Director, Xerox) succinctly stated she can “run a better and more valuable HR function with analytics at its base”. <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/simon-constance/0/486/119"" target=""_blank"">Simon Constance</a> (Director of EY’s Human Capital Advisory business and leader of the firm’s People Analytics initiative) put it in even more stark terms asserting that “the purpose of business is to generate cash,  you hire talent to create that cash and  analytics gives you the insight to realise this.”    </p>, <p><em><strong>3.</strong> <strong>But, getting started with analytics isn’t easy</strong></em></p>, <p>“Face it, you’re not Google” said <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcwest"" target=""_blank"">Mike West</a> (see far right with l-r fellow ex-Googlers Randy Knaflic, Cole Nussbaumer and Brandon Cohen)  at the start of his session on ‘Building People Analytics from the Ground Up’ (and Mike should know as he helped Google do just that). Not everyone has the luxury of hiring a 50+ team and for the vast majority budget, sponsorship and capability (in terms of all the disparate skills required) are in short supply. Over the two days, we heard from a number of speakers on the variety of ways they had overcome the challenge of getting started, which in summary included tips such as: start small, collaborate with other functions in the business (e.g. Finance, IT…), don’t be afraid to hire a consultant, be prepared to experiment, and of course…</p>, <p><strong>4. …start with the business problem</strong></p>, <p>The first commandment of People Analytics is ‘Thou Shalt Start with the Business Problem’ – this was unanimous amongst speakers and delegates alike. This means going outside the comfort zone of HR and gaining an understanding of what is keeping the CXO awake at night. The ability to ask the right questions is absolutely critical as is the gift of sifting through the issues to find those that have the biggest potential impact.</p>, <p><strong>5. Make sure the data isn’t wonky but don’t get paralysed by it</strong></p>, <p>Whilst there was no deviation from starting with the business problem there were differences of opinion on how clean the data you collect and analyse has to be. The rule seemed to be that the deeper the speaker’s own analytical skills, the more zealous there were on achieving the nirvana of 100% cleansed data. Irrespective on which side of the fence you fall down upon, you need to be able to trust your data, it needs to be specific to the business problem you are trying to address and data collection and preparation is likely to be the most time consuming part of the process. I think the much respected <a href=""https://au.linkedin.com/in/peterhowes"" target=""_blank"">Peter Howes</a> got it about right when he reflected that whilst you have nothing without addressing the hygiene factor, in itself data adds no value. This comes with…</p>, <p><strong>6. Interpreting the data and telling the story – the key to success</strong></p>, <p>Interpreting the data and distilling it into insights that unlock the business problem you are trying to tackle and then creating a compelling story to frame it is absolutely key. The quality of your data or incisiveness of your analysis doesn’t matter if you are unable to make it resonate with your business stakeholders. That means crafting a powerful story to explain it and as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/randy-knaflic/0/74/6a8"" target=""_blank"">Randy Knaflic</a> advocated in his keynote, knowing what is important to your leader. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colenussbaumer"" target=""_blank"">Cole Nussbaumer</a> (Randy’s wife – there are some seriously good analytical genes in that pairing) ran a must-see session on storytelling with data (I missed it as I was chairing the other room!. Get this right and securing additional budget for your People Analytics function should be a breeze!    </p>, <p><strong>7. The journey to Predictive Analytics needn’t be linear</strong></p>, <p>Most speakers tended to adhere to <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/Lexicon/Details.aspx?id=15392"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin’s Talent Analytics Maturity Model</a>, subscribing that the journey to predictive analytics is linear and can take anything from two to five years. I’m not so sure. <a href=""https://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> provided a convincing contrary view, describing how ABN AMRO cleaned up its operational reporting in parallel with successfully experimenting with predictive analytics - consequently delivering a number of valuable insights to the bank.  Patrick has achieved this together with one colleague – <a href=""https://nl.linkedin.com/pub/auke-ijsselstein/5/605/818"" target=""_blank"">Auke IJsselstein</a> - and the excellent <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix</a>, which just goes to show that you don’t need to have a big team to make HR Analytics work.</p>, <p><strong>8. You don’t have to be Google to excel at People Analytics</strong></p>, <p>The conference ably demonstrated that a number of organisations are fairly advanced in their maturity with people analytics. As well as the aforementioned ABN AMRO, <em><a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/ben-hawley/3/602/361"" target=""_blank"">Ben Hawley</a></em> wowed the audience with the story of Unilever’s People Analytics function. <em><a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/peter-reilly/13/1a8/293"" target=""_blank"">Peter Reilly</a></em> presented the findings of a study by the <em><a href=""http://www.employment-studies.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Institute of Employment Studies</a></em> into Best Practices in Building an HR Analytics Function, which featured anonymised findings from the likes of Shell, Rolls Royce and Maersk.  Moreover, in addition to those already highlighted in this article, with the likes of <em><a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a></em>, <em><a href=""https://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a></em>, <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a></em>, <em><a href=""https://au.linkedin.com/in/peterohanlon"" target=""_blank"">Peter O’Hanlon</a></em>, <em><a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jpholmes"" target=""_blank"">Julian Holmes</a></em> and <em><a href=""https://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a></em> operating in this space, people analytics functions are not exactly short of accomplished advisors to draw expertise from.</p>, <p><strong>9. People Analytics has created a bubble of accomplished vendors</strong></p>, <p>Another great feature of the conference was that it demonstrated the burgeoning space that is the people analytics vendor space. Whether it was highly innovative product based firms like <a href=""http://www.revelian.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Revelian</a>, <a href=""http://orgvue.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">OrgVue</a> and <a href=""http://talent-lab.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Lab</a>, or consultancies like <a href=""http://www.3nstrategy.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">3n Strategy</a>, <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix</a>, <a href=""http://www.numericalinsights.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Numerical Insights</a> and <a href=""http://www.organizationview.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Organization View</a>, practitioners have a number of tools at their disposal to help develop their functions and visualise their stories. Watch out for a future blog showcasing some of these vendors.</p>, <p><strong>10. Evolution to company-wide analytics team – opinion is split</strong></p>, <p>So what next for people analytics functions? This was one of the questions tackled by the final panel of the conference, which featured business leaders from finance, IT and marketing as well as HR. Opinion was divided as to whether HR will eventually be subsumed into a company-wide analytics team. Given the benefit of integrating business and people data, the paucity (still) of analytical skills that reside in HR and the scarcity of data scientists, I’d put my money on integration rather than separation, but let’s see what the future holds.</p>, <p><strong>11. What are the ingredients for a great conference on People Analytics?</strong></p>, <p>The final words have to be about conference organisers <a href=""https://es.linkedin.com/in/barryswales"" target=""_blank"">Barry Swales</a> and his <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/3066914?trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=clickedVertical%3Acompany%2Cidx%3A2-2-7%2CtarId%3A1430214244607%2Ctas%3Atucana"" target=""_blank"">Tucana</a> team. What are the ingredients one needs for a great people analytics conference? Take a varied and inspirational group of speakers, mix with an intelligent and knowledgeable crowd of delegates, add a sprinkling of innovative vendors and sponsors, and then put into a bowl with a trio of marvellous chairmen (<a href=""https://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a>, <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/antonfishman"" target=""_blank"">Anton Fishman</a> and some chap called <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/davidrgreen"" target=""_blank"">David Green</a> - see photo R to L).

David R. Green,"March 31, 2015",6 Key takeaways from HR Tech Europe 2015,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-key-takeaways-from-hr-tech-europe-2015-david-green/,"[<p>Those that think the pace of change we are experiencing now is too hot to handle may want to hold onto their hats as the speed of technological innovation, as popularised by the likes of Kurzweil, continues its relentless exponential growth.</p>, <p>The implications for business and the HR functions that are the custodians of their organisations talent are considerable. This was one of the overriding themes awaiting the 1,400 delegates as they gathered in London last week for the world’s fastest growing (as well as in my opinion the best curated and choreographed) HR event – HR Tech Europe.</p>, <p>As usual the organisers spoilt us with 11 differently themed parallel events and a plethora of outstanding speakers both within and beyond the world of HR, so picking out a handful of key takeaways is difficult, but here goes:</p>, <p><strong>1. The network always wins = HR needs to enable (not block) the network</strong></p>, <p><em><strong><a href=""http://www.peterhinssen.com/home"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peter Hinssen</a></strong></em> got the conference off to a tumultuous start with the Orwellian titled ‘The Network Always Wins’, which essentially challenged organisations – and critically the HR functions at their fulcrums - to move away from the 20th Century mindset of control, rigidity and silos. How can HR play a role in fuelling networks and enabling their respective organisations to stay ahead of the pack? Firstly, by allowing information to flow freely and unencumbered throughout the business and secondly, by taking a hammer to bureaucracy and sending the dreaded organisation chart the way of the dodo. Those that fail to grasp the mettle may not survive – see also <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141112080553-12091643-never-mind-the-bureaucracy-here-s-punk-rock-org-structures?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">‘Never mind the bureaucracy, here’s Punk Rock organisational structures…’</a>.</em></p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""center""><em>To help enable the flow of networks within the business, HR needs to lead the charge to abolish that outdated 20th Century concept - the organisation chart</em></p>, <p><strong>2. Collaborate or die</strong></p>, <p>Ex-acolyte of Bill Clinton and self-proclaimed expert on the collaborative economy, <em><strong><a href=""http://rachelbotsman.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rachel Botsman</a></strong></em> adopted a similar revolutionary zeal to Hinssen for her conferencing closing keynote on the ‘Future of Work’ in the collaborative economy. Botsman made a persuasive case that companies like <em><a href=""https://www.airbnb.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Airbnb</a></em>, <em><a href=""http://www.lyft.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lyft</a>, <a href=""http://wonolo.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wonolo</a></em>, <em><a href=""http://recruitloop.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">RecruitLoop</a>, <a href=""https://www.taskrabbit.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TaskRabbit</a></em> and my personal favourite <em><a href=""http://dogvacay.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">DogVacay</a></em> are changing the way people use their time, skills and talents. The success of organisations like these is a huge threat to the old economy with whole industries (including the recruitment industry) set to disintegrate before our eyes in the next ten years. Employment legislation (particularly in Europe) will also come under pressure, but will this mean dismantling frameworks designed to protect employees? Or will it remove the red tape that holds organisations back and stymies competitiveness? That's a debate that's set to roll and roll.</p>, <p> Will the likes of Wonolo, TaskRabbit and RecruitLoop mean the end of the recruitment industry as we know it?</p>, <p><strong>3. It’s time to stop just talking about HR Analytics and start actually doing it…</strong></p>, <p><strong><em><a href=""https://de.linkedin.com/pub/volker-jacobs/16/733/551/en"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a></em></strong> of CEB unveiled research that found whilst 100% of CXO believe they need HR data to make strategic decisions, only 19% have used HR data in the last year. Perhaps this is a contributory factor in why only 20% of HR transformations meet their targets? Certainly, the same CEB study concluded that the use of analytics led to 12% better talent outcomes (see below). The conference saw compelling presentations from the likes of LEGO Group and Google on how analytics underpins their people strategies. But the highlight of the two days from an HR analytics perspective was provided by <em><a href=""http://www.organizationview.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Andrew Marritt</strong> of <strong>Organization View</strong></a></em> who did a live demonstration of analytics using open source software including a predictive modelling session using data from the Titanic – not the first time nor I fear the last that the HR function has been compared to the infamously doomed White Star liner.</p>, <p>Volker Jacobs of CEB illustrated how harnessing analytics leads to 12% better talent outcomes</p>, <p>4. <strong>Sometimes, great People Analytics can take time</strong></p>, <p>It’s always fascinating to hear what the likes of Google are up to and <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/aimeecolleen/en"" target=""_blank""><em><strong>Aimee O’Malley</strong></em></a> was on hand to talk about the tech giant’s gDNA initiative – something that certainly can’t be accused of lacking ambition. For the uninitiated, gDNA (see also HBR article <em><a href=""https://hbr.org/2014/03/googles-scientific-approach-to-work-life-balance-and-much-more/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a></em>) is a 100 year project designed to improve understanding of productivity, engagement, how to cultivate leaders, how happiness impacts work and how work impacts happiness. The study is only three years old, but initial findings include that only 31% of Googlers are able to break free of the burden of blurring the balance between work and life – less than one in three maybe, but probably still a much better ratio than most companies I could mention.</p>, <p><strong>5. But, do CEOs even care about HR?</strong></p>, <p>Not according to <a href=""https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nickholley/en"" target=""_blank""><em><strong>Nick Holley</strong></em></a> of Henley Management College – or at least that’s the quote that was mistakenly attributed to him after last year’s conference in Amsterdam. Holley sought to nip the ensuing kerfuffle in the bud by explaining that what he meant was that CEOs were not interested in the traditional role of HR e.g. ensuring people are paid and receive their annual performance appraisal. But woe betide any budding HR leader that seeks to be ‘strategic’ before getting the basics right. Holley went on to reveal what CEOs DO want from their HR leaders (see Figure below), which interestingly valued integrity and courage above everything else.</p>, <p>Professor Nick Holley unveiled research from Henley Business School that found CEOs value integrity and courage from their HR leaders above everything else</p>, <p><strong>6.There’s some really cool HR vendors</strong></p>, <p>The conference floor a large of number of HR vendors displaying their wares and along with industry giants such as Workday, Oracle and IBM there were a number of companies I'd like to finish off my round-up by highlighting:</p>, <p>See you on the Champs-Élysées for <strong><em><a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech World Congress</a></em></strong> on 27-28th October for what promises to be some event.</p>, <p><strong><em>About the Author</em></strong></p>, <p><em>As well as being part of the <a href=""http://london.hrtecheurope.com/blogsquad"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech Europe Blog Squad</a>, David is a Director at </em><em><a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo</a> </em><em>(formerly known as Pinstripe &amp; Ochre House), the world’s leading provider of global talent acquisition and management solutions.

David R. Green,"February 24, 2015",Robots vs Humans: where is the Future of Work heading?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/robots-vs-humans-where-future-work-heading-david-green/,"[<p>Predicting the future can be a fool’s errand and as that scion of science fiction writing Arthur C Clarke observed, a concept that is increasingly part of a modern age where everyone seems to want to have a turn of playing Nostradamus:</p>, <p>Clarke may well have been thinking about artificial intelligence, robotics and the future of work when he penned this decidedly gloomy phrase. As technological progress gathers pace and more and more jobs are replaced by robots and software, is the future of work as bleak as the one painted by Clarke?</p>, <p><strong>The biggest change since the Industrial Revolution</strong></p>, <p>Whilst most commentators on the subject would agree that the next 10-15 years are going to see work change beyond recognition to an extent perhaps not seen since the industrial revolution, there are wildly opposing opinions on what the consequences will be.</p>, <p>These contrasting views were reflected in a fascinating study on AI, Robotics &amp; the Future of Jobs (<em><a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/files/2014/08/Future-of-AI-Robotics-and-Jobs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">download full PDF here</a></em>) conducted towards the end of last year by the US based PEW Research Center. The study asked close to 2,000 experts the following question: <em>Will networked, automated, artificial intelligence applications and robotic devices have displaced more jobs than they have created by 2025?</em></p>, <p>Opinion was split pretty much down the middle with 48% envisioning a future in which robots and digital agents have displaced significant numbers of both blue- and white-collar workers. Moreover, many contributors expressed concern that this will lead to vast increases in income inequality, masses of people who are effectively unemployable, and breakdowns in the social order. This is the ‘doomsday’ scenario as also prophesied by the Luddites at the birth of the Industrial Revolution in England in the early 1800’s.</p>, <p>The other 52% surveyed took a more optimistic view believing technology will not displace more jobs than it creates even if they acknowledge that many jobs will be substantively taken over by robots or automation by 2025. These ‘anti-Luddites’ if you like, believe that just as transpired in the Industrial Revolution and indeed ever since, new jobs and industries will emerge to replace those lost to robots and AI.</p>, <p><strong>We’re all doomed…</strong></p>, <p>So which opinion will come to pass? Those in the pessimist camp will point to the fact that automation has already extended beyond the traditional blue-collar workers into professions previously thought immune such as lawyers, accountants, architects and even doctors. When it comes to speed and precision: solving mathematical equations, performing surgery and even driving cars computers will win every time.</p>, <p>The speed of progress will undoubtedly leave many people, countless organisations and most educational systems floundering as foretold by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee in their oft quoted <em><a href=""http://www.secondmachineage.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Second Machine Age</a></em>. The MIT professors warn that as technological process steams ahead:</p>, <p>A compelling and sobering thought.</p>, <p><strong>…oh no, we’re not</strong></p>, <p>But before ye abandon all hope and start smashing the machines in full Luddite style, one may want to consider that throughout history technology has been a net creator – not destroyer – of jobs.</p>, <p>This view is bolstered by the changing dynamics of labour supply and demand that will be prevalent in the workforce of 2030.</p>, <p>Indeed, as this entertaining <em><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/rainer_strack_the_surprising_workforce_crisis_of_2030_and_how_to_start_solving_it_now?language=en"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ted Talk</a> </em>from Rainer Strack of the Boston Consulting Group highlights, research by BCG (see Figure below) suggests that contrary to fears of mass unemployment as humans are supplanted by robots, 12 of the world's 15 largest economies (together representing 70% of the world's GDP), are actually projected to face a labour shortage by 2030.</p>, <p> Source: BCG '<a href=""https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/management_two_speed_economy_public_sector_global_workforce_crisis/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Global Workforce Crisis - $10 Trillion at risk'</a></p>, <p>Whilst Strack concedes that automation will make up some of the shortfall, predicting when, how quickly and to what extent is simply impossible to quantify. Indeed, Strack believes that AI and robotics are just as likely to compound the situation with the new jobs they will bring and the new skills the technology will require actually exacerbating the already serious labour shortages.</p>, <p>The future in Strack’s native country Germany is particularly stark with labour supply predicted to be 23% (or 8m workers) shy of demand by 2030. In this case, far from being a threat the benefits of AI, robotics and technology will be substantively required to prevent Europe’s biggest economy from contracting on a massive scale. Expect Kraftwerk’s - Düsseldorf’s finest - 1978 masterpiece ‘<em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHaZ3UL2oHk"" target=""_blank"">Die Roboter</a></em> (We Are The Robots)’ to replace Das Deutschlandlied as the country’s national anthem come 2030.</p>, <p>Kraftwerk prepare themselves for the second machine age</p>, <p><strong>What is HR’s role?</strong></p>, <p>What about HR’s role in all this? The pace and extent of automation and the disappearance of old jobs and the emergence of new ones set against a climate of increasing labour shortages is perhaps the most tricky of a number of critical questions facing HR. Global strategic workforce planning is no longer a nice-to-have but an essential part of an HR leader’s toolkit if they are going to work with CXO to understand what jobs need to be filled in five, ten and fifteen years time.</p>, <p>How will HR bring more millennials, women, alumni and retirees into these newly highly skilled jobs? How will they adapt their corporate cultures to become a global destination for these employees? As work becomes more collaborative, more virtual, increasingly dependent on co-learning and context based, how will HR enable the fundamental changes that will be required to organisation structure and design?</p>, <p>Bureaucracy, hierarchy and the ghastly organisation chart are all likely to go the way of the dodo (<em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141112080553-12091643-never-mind-the-bureaucracy-here-s-punk-rock-org-structures?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">see more here</a></em>), which just goes to show that technology, automation and massive change can’t all be bad.

Hear real-life case studies and solutions from all stages of the HR analytics journey</strong></p>, <p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of the schedule for the two days is that it isn’t full of vendors selling their wares or industry thought leaders trying to foist big data onto a cynical bunch of HR leaders. Instead, it is HR leaders themselves telling their own stories of how they have successfully harnessed analytics. And these aren’t run of the mill organisations by any stretch. These are leaders in their field like Rolls Royce, Coca-Cola, Aviva and Nestlé</p>, <p><strong>2. Meet and hear from the new breed of HR leader</strong></p>, <p>To develop this point, one of the reasons I have heard repeatedly stated that HR struggles to supplant decisions based on intuition with ones founded upon data is that the latter is an alien concept to many senior career HR professionals. That may be true in some cases (<em><a href=""http://talk.ochrehouse.com/hr-analytics/getting-started-with-hr-analytics-an-hr-directors-tale-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">our fictional HR Director</a></em> being a prime example), but there is a new breed of HR leader emerging as evidenced by the stellar list of speakers at <strong><em><a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/HRAnalyticsLDN?src=hash"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">#HRAnalyticsLDN</a></em></strong>: <em><a rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jabbar Sardar</a></em> from Cafcass, <em><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pub/salvador-malo/1/183/503/en"" target=""_blank"">Salvador Malo</a></em> from Ericsson, <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinoest"" target=""_blank"">Martin Oest</a></em> from the Met and <em><a rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Hendrik Feddersen</a></em> from the European Medicines Agency to name but four.</p>, <p><strong>3. Break down the barriers to getting started with HR Analytics</strong></p>, <p>According to oft quoted <em><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2013/10/07/big-data-in-human-resources-a-world-of-haves-and-have-nots/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">research by Bersin by Deloitte</a></em>, only 14% of organisations have really got to grasps with HR Analytics, which leaves the vast majority that haven’t. Two of the barriers commonly cited are limited budget and resource as well as lack of knowledge. Both are addressed here. <em><a rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Gamlyn</a></em> will outline the talent analytics journey on which he has embarked at SIG, despite the absence of any budget. Moreover, Day 2 will see a <em><a href=""https://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/hr-workforce-analytics-london-2015/hranalyticsforbeginners"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Analytics for Beginners Workshop</a></em>, designed to help those organisations comprising the other 86% get started on the journey.</p>, <p><strong>4. Learn how HR Analytics has progressed one year on</strong></p>, <p>Some of the <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140616150124-12091643-six-takeways-from-the-hr-analytics-innovation-summit?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">key takeaways from last year’s event</a></em> included findings that that not many organisations were coupling strategic workforce planning and analytics, fewer had adopted predictive analytics and that non-HR ‘geeks’ were increasingly beginning to cross-pollinate HR and HR Analytics departments. One year on it will be fascinating to see how these themes have developed. Have more organisations managed to harness predictive analytics into their programmes? Will the call-to-arms pleas of the likes of Benjamin Taylor (<em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quant-physicist-chemist-walk-hr-benjamin-taylor"" target=""_blank"">see here</a></em>) see more quants, physicists or chemists amongst the delegates? One thing’s for sure, the sheer pace of development in the HR Analytics space is likely to produce a number of pleasant surprises throughout the two days.</p>, <p><strong>5. Network with senior-level HR Analytics thought leaders</strong></p>, <p>Let’s be honest even with top subject matter and speakers, it’s the networking that makes events like these so invaluable. With a focused group of c150 senior-level HR Analytics thought leaders and delegates attending expect some fascinating discussions over the two days (and one night). I’m certainly looking forward to catching up with many of the leaders featured in my HR Analytics influencer series (see<strong><em> <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140925070104-12091643-top-50-hr-analytics-influencers-part-1?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_COMMENT"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140930064652-12091643-top-50-hr-analytics-influencers-part-2?trk=mp-edit-rr-posts"" target=""_blank"">Part 2</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141007070413-12091643-top-50-hr-analytics-influencers-part-3?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">Part 3</a> </em></strong><em>and</em><strong><em> <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141015072410-12091643-top-71-hr-analytics-influencers-part-4?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">Part 4</a></em></strong>).

David R. Green,"February 10, 2015",HR Analytics - The New Gold Rush,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-new-gold-rush-david-green/,"[<p>Maybe it’s something in the water or perhaps it's simply the advent of a new year and all the hype that accompanies it, but it does seem there has been a visible momentum shift in in the adoption of analytics in HR.</p>, <p><em><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/02/01/geeks-arrive-in-hr-people-analytics-is-here/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Writing in Forbes</a></em>, industry sage Josh Bersin boldly proclaims “<em>the geeks have arrived in HR</em>” and that HR departments are finally “<em>getting serious about analytics. And I mean serious</em>”. HR has been dipping its feet in the analytics ocean for years without fully taking the plunge, but Bersin asserts that instead of just “<em>talking about the opportunity to apply data to people decisions, companies are now stepping up and making the investment</em>.”</p>, <p>From my discussions with HR leaders I sense too that the accelerator pedal has been pressed to the floor even if many organisations are still in the embryonic stage of datifying their HR departments. <em><a href=""http://www.ere.net/2015/02/03/more-hr-jobs-requiring-big-data-skills/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">On ERE, John Zappe</a></em> latched onto Bersin’s article and cited supporting <em><a href=""https://www.wantedanalytics.com/analysis/posts/big-data-skills-needed-in-hr-jobs"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">research from Wanted Analytics</a></em> that the number of human resources jobs advertised in Q4 2014 requiring “big data” and analytical skills had risen markedly year-on-year by 54%.</p>, <p>Could we be on the precipice of the HR equivalent of a gold rush? CHROs and other CXO have watched with envy as companies as diverse as Unilever, ABN Amro, Shell and Sears have built HR analytics functions and reaped the benefits of applying a data driven approach to talent. HR has suddenly become an interesting career destination for a number of hitherto unlikely highly skilled ‘geeks’. In the same Forbes article, Bersin talks of “<em>PhD statisticians, engineers, and computer scientists together, all working on people analytics for their companies</em>”.</p>, <p>In another excellent recent article (<em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quant-physicist-chemist-walk-hr-benjamin-taylor"" target=""_blank"">A Quant, Physicist, &amp; Chemist Walk Into HR</a></em>), Benjamin Taylor – Chief Data Scientist (now that’s a job title and a half) at HireVue and one of the ‘geeks’ highlighted by Bersin explains what attracted him from Wall Street to HR. Taylor makes an irrefutable case of why HR is ripe for disruption, has multiple challenging data problems and demands cross-pollination from other industries. This clarion call defines why HR presents such a compelling career proposition if you just happen to be a nuclear physicist, chemist, mechanical engineer, data scientist or meteorologist.</p>, <p>However, before HR joyously exclaims ‘gold’, a note of caution. It wasn’t that long ago Bersin (yes, him again) published a fairly damning indictment of HR’s immaturity with analytics – <em><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2013/10/07/big-data-in-human-resources-a-world-of-haves-and-have-nots/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">see another Forbes article here</a></em>. This study (see Figure below) showed that only 4% of companies had achieved the capability to perform “predictive analytics” on their workforce and only 14% had done any significant “statistical analysis” of employee data. This leaves a whopping 86% with fool’s gold rather than the genuine article. All the more reason to hope that Taylor’s call to arms for HR cross-pollination will be heeded.</p>, <p>Bersin by Deloitte's Talent Analytics Maturity Model</p>, <p>Initiatives like the CIPD led <em><a href=""http://www.cipd.co.uk/hr-resources/valuing-your-talent.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘Valuing Your Talent’</a></em>, which aims to provide employers with a clearer understanding of, and common means of describing, the way in which people impact the performance of their organisation will certainly help HR sort the wood from the trees.</p>, <p>More help is on hand from a number of upcoming conferences that Cielo and I are fortunate enough to be supporting in the coming weeks, starting with in chronological order:</p>, <p>Time will tell if Bersin’s is right to call it as he has, but it does seem that the stars of HR analytics have finally aligned and 2015 will prove to be a pivotal year. Let’s hope so because as to paraphrase Mark Twain’s character Mulberry Sellers: “<em>There’s gold in them thar data</em>” and “<em>there’s millions in it</em>”.</p>, <p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>, <p><em>David is a Director at </em><em><a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo</a> </em><em>(formerly known as Pinstripe &amp; Ochre House), #1 RPO on the Baker's Dozen for global breadth and quality of service.

Anyone mentioning the ‘War for Talent’ is replaced by a robot</strong></p>, <p>HR is full of lazy and over-used phrases like “seat at the table”, ""process"" and arguably “no”, but the one that really gets my goat is “war for talent”. It was first coined by McKinsey all the way back in 1997 when reality TV mercifully didn’t exist and yours truly was just embarking on a new career as a recruiter. When it comes to marketing slogans, analogies with wars – like sex – sells, but surely when it comes to the war for talent, isn’t it <strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140704062129-12091643-the-war-for-talent-after-17-years-is-it-time-for-a-new-idiom?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank""><em>time for a new idiom</em></a>?</strong> Let’s make 2015 the year that anyone in or connected to HR will be ridiculed and replaced by a robot for daring to mention this tedious phrase.</p>, <p><strong>7. Someone (anyone?) gives LinkedIn a run for its money</strong></p>, <p>Whilst I’m a paid up member of the LinkedIn fan club, it’s about time someone took them on before hubris or megalomania sets in (some may argue it already has). It doesn’t matter really if it is Facebook at Work (see <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/11/facebook-at-work/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wired article</a>), Indeed (see this <a href=""http://www.ere.net/2014/11/27/the-battle-for-global-recruiting-domination-indeed-vs-linkedin/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""> ere.net article</a>) or Google for Work or even better all of them. It will be interesting to see how LinkedIn react once someone starts to muscle in on their patch – one suspects that the cycle of spiraling costs may turn full cycle. So come on Zuckerberg, get on with it.</p>, <p><strong>8. Candidate experience gets taken more seriously</strong></p>, <p>With both scarcity and demand rising, top candidates have a multitude of options, so candidate experience is going to become increasingly important. These candidates aren’t going to spend time trying to decipher information on your organisation and how to apply. If it took 30 minutes to buy the average item on Amazon, how long do you think the company would survive? Not long. So, why do so many organisations put their candidates through purgatory by making them complete a ridiculously long application through an ATS? Indeed, as this <em><a href=""http://www.smartrecruiters.com/blog/2015-predictions-4-evolutions-of-hr-technology/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">excellent post by David Smooke on the Smart Recruiters blog</a></em> suggests many organisations ATS have effectively become a HPS – a Hiring Prevention System. Is a passive candidate having been nurtured to the virtues of your organisation more likely to apply via an elongated ATS process or with one click from their LinkedIn profile? It’s not rocket science. Nor is ensuring your site is fully optimised for mobile. People do most of their web browsing, research, and job-hunting on their phone or tablet - LinkedIn doesn’t design its new features for mobile first to try and be clever. Organisations that fail to recognise this and provide a poor candidate experience will miss out on some great hires - and business as they decide to shop elsewhere.</p>, <p><strong>9. ...so does employer brand</strong>.</p>, <p>Most organisations get how important their consumer brand is but neglect to give equal focus to their employer brand. Of course they are equally important especially when you consider that great products and services (and by linkage customers) need great talent to shape, design and deliver them. You can’t have one without the other and when that talent is scarce and in high demand, the messages and communication strategies used to spark potential candidate interest is paramount and needs to be personalised and nuanced for different target groups. Research from Lippincott and LinkedIn (see <a href=""http://lippincott.com/files/documents/news/Perspective_Align_Your_Consumer_and_Talent_Brand_LinkedIn.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) found companies with strong consumer and employer brands financially outperform their peers by 36%. So it is perhaps not surprising that Andy Curlewis, who heads up <strong><em><a href=""http://brand.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo’s Global Brand &amp; Digital practice</a></em></strong>, has been rushed off his feet in 2014. As employer brand goes into orbit, I expect that his feet won’t even touch the floor in 2015. Serves him right for being an Arsenal fan!</p>, <p><strong>10. HR becomes an agent of change as opposed to blocking it</strong></p>, <p>This could be my most wildly optimistic prediction of all, but as the pace of change intensifies and as the old ponderous bureaucratic ways of doing things continue to fail (why else would over 50% of the Fortune 500 from 2000 no longer be in existence?), HR needs to move from change blocker to change agent. Yes, it needs to consistently talk the language of the business and change its mindset of being a cost centre, but more importantly HR needs to be brave. It needs to embrace the opportunities offered through flux, changing employee attitudes, neuroscience, HR Analytics and technology to create real and lasting change in how talent is identified, recruited, activated and retained. Will this happen in 2015? Probably not but let’s at least start the New Year with a modicum of optimism.</p>, <p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>, <p><em>David is a Director at </em><em><a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo</a> </em><em>(formerly known as Pinstripe &amp; Ochre House), #1 RPO on the Baker's Dozen for global breadth and quality of service.

David R. Green,"December 17, 2014",10 Predictions for HR & Recruiting in 2015 - Part 1,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-predictions-hr-recruiting-david-green/,"[<p>Unless your name is Nostradamus, predicting the future is a mugs game. Well that’s my excuse anyway for the lack of prescience in my (admittedly optimistic) 2014 predictions for HR and talent acquisition (see links at bottom of this article).</p>, <p>Nevertheless whilst it is tempting to swap the word ‘predictions’ for ‘hopes’, like a lemming being merrily edged towards the precipice of a cliff, it’s time to take the plunge again.</p>, <p>Part 1 with predictions 1-5 is presented below, with <strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-predictions-hr-recruiting-david-green-1?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">Part 2</a> </strong>here:</p>, <p><strong>1. HR destroys bureaucracy instead of cultivating it</strong></p>, <p>Like those other discredited 20th century doctrines, communism and fascism, bureaucracy is way past its sell by date. Bureaucracy is more lethal than a particularly virile dose of salmonella and eats away at a company’s very soul. Instead of protecting it and allowing bureaucracy to multiply through mindless process, unnecessary approval flows and the dreaded organisation chart, HR needs to switch camps, don its superhero capes and stamp out bureaucracy wherever it finds it. Instead of Rules, Precedent, Hierarchy and Fear, let’s see more Values, Transparency, Aspiration and Peers.</p>, <p><strong>2. Organisation charts start to disappear</strong></p>, <p>One of the key tools of the oppressors is the organisation chart, which is arguably just as defunct as bureaucracy itself. How many organisation charts actually reflect reality? As the number of flexible workers grows the ability to capture this in an organisation chart diminishes. Organisation charts also imply that the ability to innovate and make decisions resides only in the upper echelons of the business. It doesn’t. Not anymore. Not in the creative knowledge economy we are now thankfully in. It’s time to send organisation charts the way of the dodo.</p>, <p><strong>3. The death of the traditional annual performance review</strong></p>, <p>Speaking of pointless and outdated tools and practices, hands up who thinks the annual performance review actually has any relevance? Not many hands. Ok, hands up who thinks they are a complete waste of time, money and effort? Nearly unanimous. How about employees regularly rating their immediate peers in order of how much value they provide? Now we’re talking. Over to you HR…</p>, <p><strong>4. HR finally gets jiggy with analytics – and predictive analytics</strong></p>, <p>This prediction didn’t come to pass last year, but that’s not going to stop me from boldly stating that 2015 will be the year that HR stops just talking about analytics but actually embraces it like its cousins in Finance and Marketing; not necessarily to replace traditional intuition but to validate it by making decisions that are also based on data. Moreover, predictive analytics that accurately predict hiring success, employee performance and retention will enable HR to be true partners to the business and helping drive long-term success.</p>, <p><strong>5. Cost per hire loses its exaggerated importance</strong></p>, <p>There aren’t many decisions more important to a business than determining who it hires. A cheap approach that leads to poor hires is one of the worst decisions a business can make. So why do many HR departments, Talent Acquisition functions and RPO companies focus solely on this single potentially harmful metric? 2015 will see the conversation become more rounded to include quality, agility, productivity and ultimately ROI because we all know that <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141204082733-12091643-time-to-cure-cost-per-hire-myopia"" target=""_blank"">Cost Per Hire is the wrong recruiting metric Gromit</a></em>.

David R. Green,"December 4, 2014","Cost Per Hire: ""It's the wrong recruiting metric, Gromit""",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141204082733-12091643-time-to-cure-cost-per-hire-myopia/,"[<p>I spend a fair amount of time helping companies build business cases to transform their recruiting functions. I never cease to be amazed by the myopic focus on cost per hire at the expense of everything else. Talk of return on investment (ROI) is rarer than a sighting of Haley’s Comet.</p>, <p>In every other business function whilst cost is an important factor, it is only part of a wider analysis on the value of outcomes produced by that expenditure. So why should this be different for HR and Resourcing?</p>, <p><strong>The easy option?</strong></p>, <p>McKinsey and The Conference Board's 2012 report on the Human Capital function – <a href=""https://www.conference-board.org/publications/publicationdetail.cfm?publicationid=2328"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">False Summit</a> - provides a clue that you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to latch on to. It concludes that HR has an inherent inability to relate the ROI or business impact of the function. Cost per hire, on the other hand, is comparatively straightforward to calculate.</p>, <p>Confirmation comes from the Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM), which describes itself as the world’s largest HR membership organisation. SHRM notes that many organisations monitor and calculate cost per hire data, as opposed to other HR metrics that may be more difficult to measure, because the components which make up the cost per hire calculation are frequently easy to calculate and track.</p>, <p>HR vendors including many Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) companies have to take their share of the blame too. They have been too willing to participate in a race to the bottom in terms of price, rather than accentuating less tangible benefits centred on quality of hire. It seems cost per hire myopia is dangerously contagious.</p>, <p><strong>Being hostage to cost is expensive</strong></p>, <p>In reality of course, this zealous obsession with cost per hire is injurious. One doesn’t need to be a rocket (or indeed a data) scientist to deduce that continually shaving pounds and pence from hiring costs will eventually decrease quality, damage candidate experience and result in an increase in new hire attrition. This of course snowballs the total cost of recruitment by increasing the number of hires necessary to back-fill positions. Going down this road has to be recruiting equivalent of shooting yourself in the foot. Ouch!</p>, <p><strong>Moving the conversation on to value</strong></p>, <p>There is plenty of evidence showing how short-sighted this myopic approach is. Research from the Boston Consulting Group (<em><a href=""https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/people_management_human_resources_leadership_from_capability_to_profitability/?chapter=2"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">see here</a></em>) found a direct link between the capability of a company’s HR function and its business performance. Indeed, as the graphic below illustrates delivering on recruiting came out right at the top of the list. Companies adept at recruiting enjoyed <em><strong>3.5 times the revenue growth</strong></em> and <em><strong>2.0 times the profit margin</strong></em> of their less capable peers. This represents an irrefutable case to move the discussion on from cost.</p>, <p> Source: BCG - Creating People Advantage</p>, <p>We recently hosted a Think Tank for global resourcing leaders and their procurement counterparts in London on building the business case for global transformation. Consensus amongst delegates was pretty much unanimous that the conversation needs to shift from cost to value.</p>, <p><strong>Getting jiggy with Procurement and data</strong></p>, <p>Procurement can help HR build different business case scenarios based on ROI. It is surprising therefore that this bridge to the Finance department is rarely exploited. Too often the Procurement function is used by HR merely as a facilitator of RFPs and occasionally the dreaded e-Auction (surely a completely inappropriate mechanism for selecting a resourcing partner?).</p>, <p>Instead of going down the easy and one-dimensional cost per hire road, HR and resourcing functions need to be braver. They need to put data at the forefront of their decision making, be comfortable working with assumptions and translate all this into business cases that provide insight, different scenarios and demonstrable ROI. All this may help shift the perception within the business of HR being seen solely as a cost centre. Effective HR and Talent Acquisition strategies can <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140820052309-12091643-the-e-mc2-of-talent-centricity/edit"" target=""_blank"">drive business transformation</a></em>.</p>, <p><strong>Say hello, wave goodbye </strong></p>, <p>For those that are content to continue living in the dark ages and believe that cost per hire is the recruiting equivalent of Nirvana, you may want to consider the following:</p>, <p>Whilst cost is important to track, it shouldn’t come at the expense of quality. It is just one indicator of the performance of a recruiting function. It should be measured alongside the likes of agility (time to hire, time to productivity) and quality as part of a comprehensive calculation of ROI.</p>, <p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>, <p><em>David is a Director at </em><em><a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo</a> </em><em>(formerly known as Pinstripe &amp; Ochre House), #1 RPO on the Baker's Dozen for global breadth and quality of service.

Every day we dutifully leave our 21st Century homes and travel back in time to our 20th Century workplaces.</p>, <p>Yet just as Erich Honecker and his East German politburo desperately tried to cling on to the last vestiges of power as the Berlin Wall came tumbling down around them, and Communism was shown to be a doctrine way past its sell by date; so CXO do the same with that other outmoded 20th Century dictatorial phenomena - bureaucracy.</p>, <p>But what is the alternative to Max Weber’s nightmarish vision?</p>, <p><strong>Zappos and Holacracy</strong></p>, <p>2014 was only into its third day when I learnt my first new word of the year.</p>, <p>The word was ‘Holacracy’ and it <em><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-leadership/wp/2014/01/03/zappos-gets-rid-of-all-managers/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">appeared in The Washington Post</a></em> revealing how Amazon owned on-line retailer Zappos had decided to restructure under a new ‘radical’ organisational model.</p>, <p>To the uninitiated, Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh rivals Marissa Mayer as the business leader most likely to provoke comment from the HR community. But whereas Yahoo’s CEO deals in the contentious like zapping (see what I did there?) remote workers or poor performers via the stacked curve (another archaic 20th Century practice that even Microsoft has abandoned), Hsieh prefers the more unconventional route.</p>, <p>So what is Holacracy? Well according to Zappos’ own website:</p>, <p>At first glance, it all sounds a little bit anarchic, which as a childhood punk I have to admit has some appeal. You read it here first: Zappos does Punk Rock organisational structures. Zappos was advised by a management consultant (but don’t let that put you off) by the name of <em><a href=""https://twitter.com/h1brian"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Brian Robertson</a></em>, the founder of <em><a href=""http://holacracy.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HolacracyOne</a></em> - no self-interest there then, but do stay with us.</p>, <p><em><a href=""http://qz.com/161210/zappos-is-going-holacratic-no-job-titles-no-managers-no-hierarchy/#/h/37695,1/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">This article on Quartz</a></em> explains the reasons behind Hsieh’s radical move, which was predicated on a desire to scale Zappos without letting bureaucracy set in.</p>, <p>Whilst Hsieh’s move created a whirlwind of publicity (no accident, one presumes), Zappos is not the only company to turn their noses up when it comes to bureaucracy.</p>, <p><strong>Bureaucracy gets Hamel-ed</strong></p>, <p>Indeed, the revolt against bureaucracy has its own Lech Wałęsa or Václav Havel figure in Professor Gary Hamel – see the excellent <em><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2014/11/07/why-bureaucracy-must-die/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘Bureaucracy Must Die’</a></em> Forbes article for evidence. As detailed in my previous blog rounding up <em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141027092304-12091643-key-takeaways-from-hr-tech-europe-2014?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">the highlights of HR Tech Europe 2014</a></em>, Hamel put in a barnstorming performance to close the conference as he railed against the evils of bureaucracy. He also provided several examples of companies that like Zappos (but without the publicity hungry machine behind it) had sought a different path from Orwellian bureaucracy.</p>, <p>Now here’s a thing. The likes of Morning Star, Semco and WL Gore aren’t trendy tech companies like Zappos. Yet all have eschewed traditional management structures, possess highly engaged and empowered workforces and all (something to get CXO excited here) have better business performance and market share than their peers. Relinquish control and reap the dividends.</p>, <p>Another example is <em><a href=""http://www.handelsbanken.se/shb/INeT/IStartSv.nsf/FrameSet?OpenView&amp;id=HandelsbankenSEEnglish&amp;navid=Z3_Corporate&amp;sa=/shb/Inet/ICentSv.nsf/Default/q5168599A3B405A07C125734800350089?opendocument&amp;iddef=corporate"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Handelsbanken</a></em>, Sweden’s largest and most profitable bank and unlike all of its less nimble competitors a company that grew during the Swedish banking crisis of the 1990’s as well as the global financial crisis of the last six years. Handelsbanken is almost completely decentralised with power devolved to local branches rather than residing at the centre and has only three layers of management: CEO, Head of Regional Office and Branch Manager. No FOREX or Libor scandals here.</p>, <p><strong>New century, new ideas - Choose Your Own Boss...</strong></p>, <p>The 21st century is completely different from its 20th century forefather. The age of organisation has morphed into the age of creativity (as brilliantly articulated by <em><a href=""https://twitter.com/Richard_Florida"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Richard Florida</a></em> in <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0465042481/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=479289247&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=1469281422&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_r=0CWV90CBSK9FHTSZ62N1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘The Rise of the Creative Class’</a></em>).

David R. Green,"October 27, 2014",Vive la Révolution: Key Takeaways from HR Tech Europe 2014,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141027092304-12091643-key-takeaways-from-hr-tech-europe-2014/,"[<p>Two days, ten streams 150 speakers, 2,142 delegates and a lot of Heineken. The fourth (and final) HR Tech Europe Conference in Amsterdam flew by at a pace at which no HR Transformation could hope to compete with.</p>, <p><span>Revolution was in the air throughout the two days and that is hardly a surprise. Employee engagement is at an all-time low as employees are forced to take a time machine every day from their 21st</span><span> century homes to their 20th</span><span> century offices and employers. </span></p>, <p><span>Picking out just a handful of key takeaways is difficult, but here goes…</span></p>, <p><strong>1. It’s way past time for a Management reboot and an end to the tyranny of bureaucracy</strong></p>, <p>In a barnstorming close to the conference, management guru Professor Gary Hamel ripped into the archaic so last century bureaucratic hierarchical organisations that stifle innovation, decimate engagement and fail in the new creative economy. There is a reason why 52% of the Fortune 500 of 2000 have disappeared into the vapour - Max Weber’s nightmarish bureaucratic vision is no longer relevant. Speed trumps process, innovation is no longer the sole preserve of a small executive elite and employees are no longer prepared to tolerate being constrained in a box. Hamel argued that it is way past time for Management 2.0 – a reboot where Values, Transparency, Aspiration and Peers replace Rules, Precedent, Hierarchy and Fear. Companies as diverse as Semco, WL Gore and Morning Star (that's <em><a href=""http://www.morningstarco.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">tomatoes</a> </em>not<em> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Star_(British_newspaper)"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">communism</a></em>) have already embraced this new reality. Consequently, they all have engaged and empowered workforces and outperform their competition by a country mile. Think BYOD is radical? How about CYOB – Choose Your Own Boss?</p>, <p><em>I’m not sure if Hamel’s speech will ever be available on the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/hrneurope"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech Europe YouTube channel</a>, but if it is it should be mandatory viewing for <span>all </span>CEOs. Many of the presentations are available on the HR Tech Europe Slideshare <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/hrtecheurope"" target=""_blank"">page</a>.</em></p>, <p><strong>2. Simplicity. Beautiful Data. Digital Artisans.</strong></p>, <p>Hamel’s was one of many great keynotes. To pick another three: Yves Morieux’s “Smart Simplicity” conference opener really resonated with the audience and was sprinkled with Gallic humour. Then David McCandless’ potent mix of data, visuals and humour proved beyond doubt that HR information is indeed beautiful (check out these <em><a href=""http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">visuals</a></em>). Finally in a perfect antidote to the fuzzy heads caused by Thursday night’s parties (thanks Broadbean), Ray Wang opened up day two with an energetic performance as he prowled the main stage like a ravenous panther. Wang argued that it was proficiency rather than age that is the real digital barometer and eulogised digital artisans as the catalysts that will change the way companies think, design and deliver in the digital era. With his ability to sign up the best players around, if only HR Tech Europe’s head honcho Marc Coleman also ran transfer strategy for Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool…</p>, <p><strong>3. HR <span class=""underline"">is</span> being disrupted</strong></p>, <p>If the mood on the main stage was revolutionary, HR’s Bastille was breached continuously on the conference fringes. The #disruptHR zone saw raconteurs like William Tincup and Bill Boorman rubbing shoulders with start-ups like <em><a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix</a>, <a href=""http://www.joberate.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Joberate</a>, <a href=""https://www.recrout.com/en/#/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Recrout</a>, <a href=""https://www.talmundo.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talmundo</a> </em>and<em> <a href=""https://www.smartrecruiters.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">SmartRecruiters</a></em>. Other disruptive influences included the wonderfully laconic John Sumser whose <em><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/hrtecheurope/john-sumser-future-of-work"" target=""_blank"">‘Computational HR’</a></em> described how the likes of Gild and IBM are taking HR into the realms of neuroscience – all it needed was an ominous <em><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWTUt2RZh0"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk soundtrack</a></em> to complete the futurist zeal. It wasn’t just the analysts and start-ups ripping up the rule book either - <em><a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/davebuglass"" target=""_blank"">Dave Buglass</a></em> had heads nodding as he described the journey of Tesco Bank from niche business to one with a full service offering.</p>, <p><strong>4. How much longer will HR Analytics be the Elephant in the room?</strong></p>, <p>HR analytics were omnipresent. Josh Bersin cited big data as the elephant in the room and one of three technology trends HR can’t afford to ignore. Holger Mueller outlined how analytics will increasingly disrupt HR and why recruiting is its biggest showcase. This was certainly evident in pitches made by the likes of <em><a href=""http://www.joberate.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Joberate</a></em> and <em><a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix</a></em> in the #disruptHR zone and also <em><a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a>’s</em> ‘Towards Fact Based HR’, which presented how harnessing predictive HR analytics has enabled improved business performance at ABN AMRO. There is a reason why IBM has bet its entire future on analytics, and even for HR this will become increasingly clear.</p>, <p><strong>5. What of the HR Tech beasts?</strong></p>, <p>The big three – Oracle, SuccessFactors and Workday were a ubiquitous presence and a number of their customers stood up to espouse the not insignificant benefits their organisations had gained from implementing their technology. <em><a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/gareth-williams/32/684/392"" target=""_blank"">Gareth Williams</a></em> offered a particularly compelling case as to how Workday had proved a catalyst for change at Travelex. The Talking Heads session was fun as the big three squirmed uncomfortably in their chairs as Jason Averbook mischievously (and repeatedly) asked the leaders of Workday, SuccessFactors and Oracle to outline why they were better than the other two. For once all three seemed remarkably coy and as Holger Mueller observed sought to spin in unison. It will certainly be interesting to observe how these companies evolve as the predictions of the like of Hamel, Wang and Sumser take hold – will they be able to keep up with the pace and extent of change?</p>, <p><strong>And finally...Guillotines at the ready; the revolution will be televised</strong></p>, <p>Ancien régime diehards beware, the guillotines are being sharpened as the fastest growing and indisputably best HR conference (and before you ask, I was not paid to write that) heads to the Palais des Congrès in Paris next year. Whilst it will be difficult to top 2014 - the cherry on the top being the cool android badges for the kids from <em><a href=""https://www.google.com/work/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Google for Work</a></em> - do you know I think Marc and his intrepid team might just succeed.</p>, <p>See you on the Champs-Élysées.</p>, <p><strong><em>About the Author</em></strong></p>, <p><em>David is a Director at </em><em><a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo</a> </em><em>(formerly known as Pinstripe &amp; Ochre House), <span>the world’s leading provider of global talent acquisition and management solutions.

David R.

Considered as Europe's most important HR event and claiming to influence more than 20m people, over 2,000 delegates are expected (a 30% increase on 2013) with the vast majority being HR decision makers. As part of the official <a href=""http://amsterdam.hrtecheurope.com/blogsquad"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Blog Squad</a>, I will be posting throughout the event. </em></p>, <p>Whilst HR should be a case of strategy first, technology second, if you work in the HR space, you’re in the HR Tech industry - you simply can’t do your job without your systems functioning at peak performance.</p>, <p>The world of work is changing increasingly rapidly as we hurtle towards the much heralded Workplace 2020. The power of ‘networks’ is all encompassing and businesses face the not inconsiderable challenge of whether this growing band of global, expert, connected and mobile workers can best thrive within traditional hierarchical structures.</p>, <p>The convergence of consumer and employer brands, business and talent analytics as well as cloud and mobile has changed the playing field. At the same time, the lens on HR and Talent functions has never been so intense. Surveys of CEOs regularly cite talent as the key concern of business leaders, but most HR functions are failing to live up to the weighty expectations placed on their shoulders.</p>, <p>How will companies become networks and communities themselves, and evolve from static structures? How will we harness and decipher Big Data and let predictive talent analytics flourish? How can HR leaders capitalise on collaborative technology and the cloud? Perhaps most pertinently, when will HR and talent functions start talking the language of the business, which is economics and not talent management mumbo jumbo?</p>, <p>Whilst the conference cannot be expected to answer all these questions, it should provide several clues as to how organisations can tackle the state of flux we find ourselves in whilst providing a barometer as to how far HR is on the journey.</p>, <p>Here’s what I am particularly looking forward to:</p>, <p><strong>1. </strong><strong>Checking out the next generation of disruptive HR Technology</strong></p>, <p>Whilst the big boys like Oracle, SAP, IBM and Workday will have a vast and visible presence, it is the new kids on the block that will hold my gaze. A great new addition this year is the <strong><em><a href=""http://blog.hrtecheurope.com/disruption/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Disrupt HR stream</a></em></strong>, where young agile start-ups will step into the Innovations Zone for a Warhol-esque 15 minutes of show and tell sessions that will provide a real sense of what’s really disrupting HR. Look out for the likes of <em><a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix</a>, <a href=""http://www.joberate.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Joberate</a>, <a href=""http://www.socialtalent.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Social Talent</a>, <a href=""http://gooodjob.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">GooodJob</a></em> and <em><a href=""http://www.electronicinsight.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">eiTalent</a></em>.</p>, <p><strong><span>2. </span></strong><strong>Predictive Talent Analytics</strong></p>, <p>Analytics is HR’s big opportunity to deliver insights to the C-Suite that can predict the likely business outcomes of a whole raft of talent initiatives. It is disappointing therefore that research from the likes of Bersin continues to highlight that less than 5% of companies have achieved the level to perform predictive talent analytics and not many more have done any substantive statistical analysis of employee data at all. Talent Analytics is one of the key themes of the two days and it will be fascinating to hear whether the HR community sees Talent Analytics as an opportunity or a threat. Look out for <em><a href=""http://blog.hrtecheurope.com/information-explosion-tame-wild-beast/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen of ABN AMRO</a></em>’s session on 'Fact Based HR' and the keynote from <em><a rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">David McCandless</a></em> entitled ‘HR Information is Beautiful’. Many of our recently published <strong><em>‘Who’s Who of HR Analytics’</em></strong> will be present over the two days – see <strong><em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140925070104-12091643-top-50-hr-analytics-influencers-part-1?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_COMMENT"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140930064652-12091643-top-50-hr-analytics-influencers-part-2?trk=mp-edit-rr-posts"" target=""_blank"">Part 2</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141007070413-12091643-top-50-hr-analytics-influencers-part-3?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">Part 3</a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141015072410-12091643-top-71-hr-analytics-influencers-part-4?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">Part 4</a></em> </strong>to check out the key influencers in this burgeoning area of HR.</p>, <p><strong>3. </strong><strong>The Future is Digital</strong></p>, <p>One of the keynotes is being delivered by <em><a href=""https://twitter.com/rwang0"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ray Wang</a></em>, Founder and Principal Analyst at Constellation Research. He will outline why organisations are no longer just selling products and services but also outcomes and experiences that support a brand promise. This will have a huge impact not just on the skillsets business requires but on the digital outlook it needs to embrace. Ray will explain how organisations can build digital artisans and why they are needed in the era of complete transparency.</p>, <p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Be inspired by great speakers</strong></p>, <p>One of the reasons that HR Tech Europe is so well attended is - like Liverpool in this summer’s transfer window - no expense has been spared on assembling a crack list of industry thought leaders and innovators (the organisers have done much better than Brendan Rodgers in this regard – thankfully Mario Balotelli will not be in Amsterdam). Those of you who have seen <em><a href=""https://twitter.com/jasonaverbook"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jason Averbook</a></em> in full flow, will know that there are not many better or more knowledgeable presenters in this field around. Other speakers not already mentioned that I am looking forward to hearing include Josh Bersin, Yves Morieux, Gary Hamel, John Sumser and Naomi Bloom whilst Nick Holley’s provocatively titled ‘Traditional Talent Management is Dead’ and <em><a href=""https://twitter.com/digitalHRD"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gareth Williams</a></em>, Group HR Director at Travelex’s ‘The Future is Cloud’ both promise to be interesting. With 99 speakers to choose from, delegates are hardly spoilt for choice.</p>, <p><strong><span>5. </span></strong><strong>Network, network, network; blog, blog, blog...</strong></p>, <p>Let’s be honest even with top subject matter and speakers, it’s the networking that makes events like these so invaluable. With over 2,000 delegates attending, the two days (and nights) are a fantastic opportunity to mix with some of the crème de la crème of the HR and HR Technology world. With the added plus of being part of the official Blog Squad allied to all that networking, I don’t expect much banter about the red lights (or even tulips) of Amsterdam; much more likely there will be plenty of red eyes come the end of the event.</p>, <p><strong><em>About the Author</em></strong></p>, <p><em>David is a Director at </em><em><a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo</a> </em><em>(formerly known as Pinstripe &amp; Ochre House), <span>the world’s leading provider of global talent acquisition and management solutions.

Even better some of those already named have told me they have been contacted as a result with business opportunities. Every little helps as Tesco might say.</p>, <p>My original collection of 50 was never going to be definitive and I knew at the outset that I will have unknowingly omitted many influencers who should have been included. This has certainly proven to be the case – hence this fourth instalment making a round 72 - hey, who said data was perfect.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""http://au.linkedin.com/in/johnaaustin"" target=""_blank"">John Austin</a></strong> - Organisational Psychologist and CEO of <em><a href=""http://www.talegent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talegent</a></em>, a provider of talent measurement solutions.

A number have advised that the flow of career, speaking and business opportunities coming their way has risen since the series was published.</p>, <p>Correlation? It would appear so. Causation? Maybe…</p>, <p>It is humbling to have helped – even in a small way – to increasing the profile of HR Analytics and those that are pioneering its use within (arguably) the last bastion of business to embrace a data driven approach.

David R. Green,"September 9, 2014",5 key takeaways from #HRTechEurope 2.013,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140909062142-12091643-5-key-takeaways-from-hrtecheurope-2-013/,"[<p> </p>, <p><em>My company, <a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo</a> (previously Pinstripe &amp; Ochre House) is once again sponsoring the <a href=""http://amsterdam.hrtecheurope.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Tech Europe</a> conference in Amsterdam on 23-24 October - the largest and premier gathering in Europe of professionals in the HR and Recruitment technology space. In the run-up and immediate aftermath, I’ll be publishing a number of blogs on the conference. This first one looks back at my key takeaways from last year:</em></p>, <p>The pulse on the floor in 2013 was that HR was playing catch-up, so it will be interesting to see the progress made in the last 12 months:</p>, <p><strong>1. </strong><strong>In chaos, there is opportunity</strong></p>, <p>Radical changes are taking place in almost everything we do in business today. Standing still is not an option. If businesses fail to be agile and don’t continue to innovate then they will die. Blackberry has gone from 51% market penetration to 3% in four years. How do you fail so badly? By failing to innovate, being complacent and by having less deep specialist expertise than your competitors – the last in particular is a call to arms for HR and Talent Management professionals. Ten years ago, the average organisation was involved in M&amp;A activity every 7.2 years; now it is every nine months. Integrating M&amp;A talent quickly and seamlessly – without losing it - is of paramount importance – and the responsibility for this resides squarely with HR. Amidst the chaos and sheer velocity of change, HR has an opportunity to become the architect of the organisation. Hiring, integrating, developing and retaining talent in parallel with developing the context, values and processes that the new generation of employees with their different values, mindsets and priorities demand is a tough challenge. But if HR can grasp it, they can secure their role within the organisation and actually increase their influence at the top table.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>2. </strong><strong>The future of work is already here</strong></p>, <p>The new technologies of the social era have already changed the way businesses interact with their customers with every touch-point having the potential to be a global PR disaster – or triumph. They are also changing the way businesses operate with far-sighted companies moving from internal R&amp;D to open innovation – if you want a new product, just ask. This prompted Professor Costas Markides of London Business School in his barnstorming opening keynote to proclaim that “<em>the hierarchy is dead</em>”. This seismic shift was borne out in the remainder of the two days. <a href=""https://twitter.com/JohnSumser"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">John Sumser</a> ran a particularly insightful session on how technology will reshape and redesign the HR function. For instance, how will organisations cope with the likelihood that 15% of its employees will be wearing Google Glass to work this time next year? The good news for HR leaders struggling to cope with the sheer speed of change is that the thinking and the supporting tools and technology are there if they are prepared to embrace the revolution.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>3. </strong><strong>HR Technology is exploding with ideas</strong></p>, <p>As Technology has continued to evolve, it has in many ways become easier to quickly establish a start-up and the conference demonstrated that the HR Technology space is exploding with ideas. Once one got beyond the sheer magnitude of the Success Factors spaceship, Oscar the Oracle robot and the other big vendors, there were some particularly interesting tools from the likes of:</p>, <p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Analytics could be HR’s last chance to be relevant</strong></p>, <p><a href=""https://twitter.com/Josh_Bersin"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> provided an irrefutable case for talent analytics, suggesting that the datafication of HR will be as important for business as electrification was 100 years ago. <a href=""https://twitter.com/Nick_Holley"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nick Holley</a> was even more frank in his session entitled <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/hrtecheurope/nick-holley-talent-management-minus-big-data"" target=""_blank"">Talent Management - Big Data = Unsubstantiated Rubbish</a> arguing big data in HR is not only inevitable but that it will revolutionise the function. Astonishingly, research by Holley’s Henley Business School uncovered a number of cases where HR was deliberately undermining the business case for a more data driven approach. This can partly be explained by the vast majority of HR professionals being uncomfortable with data and the fear that it will reduce their culture of intuition. <a href=""https://twitter.com/DanielPink"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Pink</a>, in another conference keynote, argued that the two should not necessarily be exclusive and that there is room for both data and hunches – that should be a compromise that those gut instinct HR professionals should be able to live with.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>5. </strong><strong>The HR space has heroes in abundance</strong></p>, <p>Judging by the quality of the thought leaders and speakers over the two days, HR has plenty of choice to as <a href=""https://twitter.com/jasonaverbook"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jason Averbook</a> pleaded for, identify its heroes. Who will be the HR Ali’s, Mandela’s and Einstein’s? The next few years will tell. Sumser, Holley, Markides, Bersin, <a href=""https://twitter.com/InFullBloomUS"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Naomi Bloom</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ArminTrost"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Armin Trost</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/williamtincup"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">William Tincup</a> all suggested to varying degrees that they will by jockeying for position, but it was Averbook himself who stole the show. His witty, insightful and utterly compelling keynote on <em>‘Why We Can’t Afford To Waste Another Generation Of HR/Workforce Technology</em>’ demonstrated that knowledge, preparation, audience participation, humour and a story are all vital ingredients in delivering a captivating conference speech.

David R. Green,"August 25, 2014",Talent Economics - HR's chance to be the hero?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140825165054-12091643-talent-economics-hr-s-chance-to-be-the-hero/,"[<p>Just occasionally a television programme, album or book comes along that is just so jaw droppingly good that it leaves you lost for words (a rare thing indeed for yours truly). The BBC’s current Hugo Blick penned and directed drama, <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01z78nq"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Honourable Woman</a> ticks the box as far as television goes. The last great album for this writer was five years ago (perhaps a sign of my age as much as the insipidness of the modern music scene), when Yeah Yeah Yeahs went all electronic with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=ALNb4maWNoT6Q1QmGg4wxC0UXILXfBiMwJ"" target=""_blank"">‘It’s Blitz’</a>.</p>, <p><span>As for books, Nicholas Lovell’s formidably good </span><a href=""http://www.thecurveonline.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘The Curve’</a><span> shone a new light on how businesses in the 21st</span><span> century should price their products and services. But when was the last great book about HR or Talent? That would be like expecting One Direction to sing in tune, or Arsenal not to fade away miserably in February or March; or so I thought.</span></p>, <p><span>Then I came across </span><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Economics-Between-Winning-Losing/dp/0749468483"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Economics</a><span> by </span><a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=gyan%20nagpal&amp;src=typd"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Gyan Nagpal</a><span>. Just like Nessa Stein, Karen O and The Curve, this is a seminal piece of work.</span></p>, <p><span>Talent Economics brings workforce analysis, management practice and business strategy together. It uses economic inquiry as a discipline to present a refreshingly new perspective on talent management and examines the macro- and micro-economic factors that are driving the future global demand and supply of talent. Critically, it then goes further in outlining a methodology designed to enable HR leaders to diagnose, design and deliver a high impact talent strategy that is data driven and in a language that business leaders understand.</span></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140820052309-12091643-the-e-mc2-of-talent-centricity?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">Last week</a><span> I asked why HR and talent strategies get deprioritised when companies embark on major business transformations despite CEOs regularly citing talent as the biggest enabler (and blocker) of growth. I surmised that it may be due to HR's inability to talk the language of the business and its continuing failure to link the initiatives on which it embarks to the bottom line. Certainly, many commentators argue that HR’s failure to embrace big data and a more analytical approach is holding it back (</span><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140812063504-12091643-is-hr-ready-for-the-big-data-analytics-revolution?trk=mp-details-rr-rmpost"" target=""_blank"">see Is HR ready for the big data and analytics revolution?</a><span>).

David R. Green,"August 20, 2014",How can HR & Talent drive your company's business transformation strategy?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140820052309-12091643-the-e-mc2-of-talent-centricity/,"[<p>For the umpteenth time, the oft quoted and much revered <a href=""http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/index.jhtml?WT.ac=vt-ceosurvey"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PwC Global CEO Survey</a>, now in its 17th edition and unveiled amidst much grandeur each January in Davos, revealed that talent strategies are regarded by business leaders as the biggest enabler of transformative growth but also its most significant threat (see figure below).</p>, <p><br/><br/></p>, <p>As Thom Yorke would doubtless drone <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQqbuZOPE5g"" target=""_blank"">No Surprises</a> there. However, why is it then that when a business actually begins to execute a transformation strategy does talent get pushed down the list of priorities?</p>, <p>Customer growth and retention, R&amp;D and innovation as well as investments in technology all typically come to the fore and understandably so. But what is it that links all these together? What is it that enables growth, innovation and return on investment to flourish? And conversely what is it that stymies growth, inhibits innovation and reduces ROI? The answer of course to all three questions is the talent (or more pertinently lack of it) within the business.</p>, <p>Survey after survey and white paper after white paper documents the link between talent centricity and business performance. The more aligned and integrated talent management is with the business strategy, the greater the impact on the bottom line and the bigger the competitive advantage.</p>, <p>The difference between those who excel at talent management and those that don't is marked. As I referred to in my recent Blackadder referencing post: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140704062129-12091643-the-war-for-talent-after-17-years-is-it-time-for-a-new-idiom?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">The War for Talent – it’s time for a new idiom</a>, research by the Corporate Leadership Council found that the average revenue growth per annum over a 20 year period of talent centric organisations was 7.7% compared to just 0.6% for laggards. That is pretty compelling in my book and something that was echoed in our recent <a href=""http://resources.cielotalent.com/2014-Web-Downloads_Cielo-Talent-Activation-Index.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo Talent Activation Index</a>, which established a clear correlation between organisations that effectively aligned talent strategies to business priorities with their ability to execute on these goals.</p>, <p>The example of Google is habitually held up as the epitome of a talent centric organisation with one celebrated example being the <a href=""http://www.tlnt.com/2013/02/26/how-google-is-using-people-analytics-to-completely-reinvent-hr/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiring algorithm</a> they have developed to predict which applicants will be successful at the company. Google’s detractors counter that it is easy for the technology giant to invest in talent strategies because they are operating at margins of over 60%. Whilst this at least warrants a mention in dispatches, I would counter with what came first - the fabulous business performance and seemingly unstoppable business growth or the culture of talent centricity? Maybe, just maybe it was the egg rather than the chicken on this occasion.</p>, <p>Being talent centric is just as important as being customer centric. You can't have one without the other. Customer trends and needs define and dictate the products and services a business provides. Great talent within the organisation innovates, shapes and delivers great products and experiences to its customers. One is irrelevant without the other. For organisations that get this right, the opportunity is competitive advantage through people and improved business performance.</p>, <p>So we return to the question as to why talent strategies so often get relegated to the periphery when an organisation embarks on a major transformation.</p>, <p>The answer may lie in HR's inability to talk the language of the business and the function’s continuing failure to link the initiatives on which it embarks to the bottom line. HR continues to measure the wrong things. Mr Spock would call it illogical, I call it nonsensical. For example, with regards to measuring the effectiveness of a talent acquisition initiative the time-to-hire is largely an irrelevance compared to the time-to-productivity of a new hire. Similarly, the number of open requisitions is less important than the loss of revenue arising from having posts unfilled.</p>, <p>I’ve said it before and no doubt I’ll say it again but the transformation of HR into a data-driven function is inevitable. Whilst some early-adopters have embraced it, most haven’t. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2013/10/07/big-data-in-human-resources-a-world-of-haves-and-have-nots/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Research last autumn from Bersin</a> found that just 4% of companies have achieved the level to perform predictive talent analytics and only 14% have done any substantive statistical analysis of employee data at all.</p>, <p>It is time to stop holding back the tide. Big data is arguably HR’s last opportunity to be relevant and by grasping the bull by the horn and coupling a data driven approach to aligning and integrating talent management to the business strategy, HR can finally converse in the language of the business.</p>, <p>As the evidence mounts up on the correlation of a twin-pronged approach of customer and talent centricity is to superior business performance, then talent will stop being pushed down the list of priorities when it comes to maximising the ROI of business transformation. HR has the keys in its hands. Will they open the door to talent’s equivalent of E=mc (as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHTDkJ-bQqM"" target=""_blank"">soundtracked by Big Audio Dynamite</a>)?

David R. Green,"August 12, 2014",Is HR ready for the Big Data & Analytics revolution?,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140812063504-12091643-is-hr-ready-for-the-big-data-analytics-revolution/,"[<p>We live in a world of Big Data, and whilst it is a subject that has been hyped more than Lady Gaga’s insipidly bad eighties retro Europop, many people believe it will change the world. Some even claim big data will be bigger than the Internet. That is as an outlandish a claim (minus the blasphemy) as the one made by the late, great John Lennon in the mid-sixties when comparing the relative size of The Beatles to Jesus Christ. But does it stack up? And what is the impact on HR and Talent Acquisition professionals?</p>, <p>To put the amount of data we generate in the world into context it is worth revisiting the staggering revelation Google CEO Eric Schmidt made in 2011:</p>, <p><em>“Every two days we create as much information as we did from the dawn of civilisation up until 2003”</em></p>, <p>Think about that for a minute. As stats go that’s up there with Donald Bradman’s Test batting average of 99.94 – surely the most remarkable sports stat as it is over 50% better than the second best average in history. Anyway, I digress…</p>, <p>Sir Martin Sorrell <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130925135755-237838958-creativity-in-the-age-of-the-maths-men"" target=""_blank"">said last year</a> that <em>“the future of advertising and marketing services belongs as much to Maths Men (and women) as it does to Mad Men (and women)”</em>. A similar trend is taking place in HR, where CIO magazine reported the function being “<em><a href=""http://www.cio.com/article/2383195/business-intelligence/hr-departments-invaded-by-data-scientists.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">invaded by Data Scientists</a></em>”. But is HR ready for the revolution in Talent Analytics that big data has ignited?</p>, <p>In a business world dominated by numbers, balance sheets and return on productivity. HR is increasingly isolated in its inability to talk the language of the business. McKinsey’s 2012 report on the Human Capital function – <a href=""https://www.conference-board.org/publications/publicationdetail.cfm?publicationid=2328"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">False Summit</a>, concluded HR has an inherent inability to relate the ROI or business impact of the function. This was echoed by Josh Bersin in Forbes where he presented findings from research that suggested <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2013/10/07/big-data-in-human-resources-a-world-of-haves-and-have-nots/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">only 14% of organisations studied</a> had done any significant “statistical analysis” of employee data at all.</p>, <p>The extent of this chasm between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’ is reflected in Cielo’s Talent Activation Index (<a href=""http://resources.cielotalent.com/2014-Web-Downloads_Cielo-Talent-Activation-Index.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">download a copy here</a>), which found that Leaders are 12 times more likely than Laggards to rate their use of data and analytics to inform workforce strategies as “very effective” (72% vs. 6%).</p>, <p>Generally speaking there is a paucity of data-driven analysis and where it does exist, it is not tied to financial measures or communicated well. The consequence is that this can prevent HR from gaining buy-in for innovation, no matter how much it is needed.</p>, <p>So, is there anything that HR can do to rectify this situation? Is this an opportunity to not only gain that long sought after seat at the table, but actually provide insightful talent analytics that have a quantifiable impact on business performance?</p>, <p>Fortunately, the answer to both questions is a resounding yes. HR actually sits on a gold mine of data, but sadly is often not using it well. This is the critical point. The answer does not lie in purchasing expensive technology solutions – a fool with a tool, is still a fool - but in simply doing a better job of applying existing data insights to critical business questions. Moreover, it needs to present the insights in a language the business understands. Chief Executives want HR data to be like financial data: standardised, specific and clearly linked to outcomes.</p>, <p>Take the following example. The HR Director of a large financial services organisation had identified it was taking an average of 55 days to hire Insurance Sales Agents. Having benchmarked his competitors and confirmed that this was too long, he called in a team of external consultants. Several workshops later the HRD signed a contract to install a new Talent Acquisition system. Twelve months on, the HRD and the partner from the consultancy firm were in the CEO’s office excitedly telling him that the $1.5m investment had reduced time to hire from 55 to 37 days. The CEO was distinctly unimpressed. “<em>You mean it takes 37 </em>(insert expletive)<em> days to hire an insurance agent? Get out</em>” he shouted as they scuttled out of the office.</p>, <p>Initially flummoxed after the unexpected hairdryer treatment, the HRD and consultant regrouped and decided to look at how they could present the data differently. A fortnight later, things duly went a lot better. “<em>We hire 3,000 Agents per year and their average revenue per day is $700</em>” ventured the HRD. “<em>By reducing the average time to hire by 18 days, we estimate that we generated additional revenues of $37.8m in the last 12 months</em>”.</p>, <p>The CEO, for once smiling and full of bonhomie, came over and slapped them both on the back and acclaimed “<em>now that’s the kind of data I want from my HR function</em>”. Lesson learned.</p>, <p>Whilst in part anecdotal, this story is an all too common example of one of HR’s main weaknesses. Conversely, it also provides a clear indication of the huge opportunity available if HR is prepared to do things differently. First, by adopting a scientific approach to collecting and analysing data biased towards answering critical business decisions related to talent. Then by presenting it in a language that the business understands, HR will help drive the business agenda , gain influence and have a positive and quantifiable impact on the bottom line.</p>, <p>However, as Bersin highlights and as I heard for myself when I chaired the recent HR &amp; Workforce Analytics Summit in London (<strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140616150124-12091643-six-takeways-from-the-hr-analytics-innovation-summit?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">read my six key takeaways here</a></strong>), a growing number of HR functions have made the great leap forward and have analytics and data at the centre of their HR strategy.

Today, we conclude by looking at predictions 6-10 as well as the bonus one featuring our cover star Marissa.</p>, <p>So Nostradamus or nonsense? Here goes…</p>, <p><strong>6. Companies that don’t enhance the candidate experience, will lose candidates</strong></p>, <p>Just as having a segmented approach to attracting and hiring will become increasingly important so will the experience candidates encounter once they are in your process. Top candidates have lots of options, so they aren’t going to spend a lot of time trying to decipher information on your organisation and how to apply. If it took 30 minutes to buy the average item on Amazon, how long do you think the company would survive? Not long. So, why do so many organisations put their candidates through purgatory by making them complete a ridiculously long application through an ATS? Is a passive candidate more likely to apply this way or with one click from their LinkedIn profile? It’s not rocket science. Nor is ensuring your site is fully optimised for mobile. People do most of their web browsing, research, and job-hunting on their phone or tablet - LinkedIn doesn’t design its new features for mobile first to try and be clever. Organisations that fail to recognise this and provide a poor candidate experience will miss out on some great hires. <strong><em>Nostradamus rating – 9 (out of 10): whilst there are still some shocking examples of companies serving up a dog’s dinner to candidates, the focus on candidate experience and mobile is definitely there. </em></strong></p>, <p><strong>7. The rise of referrals, boomerangs and acqui-hiring</strong></p>, <p>Many studies conclude that effective referral programmes produce better quality of hires through high performance, good retention rates and reduced time and cost of hire as well as engaging the best talent already in the organisation. The social media revolution has enabled technology companies like <a href=""http://www.careerify.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Careerify</a> and <a href=""https://www.zao.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Zao</a> to harness the networks of an organisation’s employees to make referrals easy and fun through gamification. This trend is set to continue. As will ‘boomerang’ rehiring of alumni and also perhaps the ‘acqui-hiring’ strategies popularised by the likes of Facebook, Google and most recently Yahoo. Mark Zuckerberg has boasted previously that “Facebook has not once bought a company for the company itself. We buy companies to get excellent people”. This phenomenon may extend beyond the Technology sector as merger and acquisition activity heats up. <strong><em>Nostradamus rating – 6: the market (at least in Europe) is still at the early adopter stage in terms of getting clever about referrals and alumni, but with Careerify now counting the likes of Deloitte amongst its customers, watch this space. </em></strong></p>, <p><strong>8. Video killed the radio star</strong></p>, <p>With great talent getting scarcer and in higher demand, companies will need to cast the net further afield and with live video interviewing continuing to grow in acceptance, this is good news for the likes of Hire Vue, Sonru and Montage. Along with the previously mentioned Careerify and Zao, expect them to be acquisition targets for some of big HR Technology boys. <strong><em>Nostradamus rating – 5: Surprisingly, many organisations (or at least the ones I speak to) are suspicious when it comes to embracing video, although a growing number of our US customers have adopted video particularly for sales roles.</em></strong></p>, <p><strong>9. Co-sourcing – a middle ground between RPO and in-house</strong></p>, <p>A more segmented and agile approach requires a more flexible and capable service and that means that organisations will increasingly implement a third way to the traditional ‘eggs in one basket’ wholly outsourced or fully in-house options. The ‘Third Way’ is not some dodgy leftover of New Labour but a different perspective to outsourcing whereby an organisation transfers in expertise from a third party to work alongside its in-house team. This partnership model could for example involve each party having responsibility for certain segments within the ‘Talented Many’, ‘Skilled Few’ and ‘Expert One’ segments of an organisation’s workforce I outlined yesterday. This is a model that Cielo has pioneered with a number of customers where we deliver a ‘hybrid’ solution – neither fully outsourced nor fully in-house. As more agile talent acquisition strategies are required expect this marriage of the best of both worlds to become the norm rather than the exception. <strong><em>Nostradamus rating – 9: The growth in co-sourcing is rapid particularly in certain industry sectors and certainly in Europe. This requires a more agile and collaborative approach from RPOs – it will be interesting to see how many can step up to the level we have already attained at Cielo</em></strong></p>, <p><strong>10. A challenger emerges to rival LinkedIn </strong></p>, <p>Admittedly more of a wish than a prediction, not that one has anything against LinkedIn just to be clear. It’s just that with the social media company becoming ever more dominant it may only be a matter of time before megalomania or hubris sets in and neither would be good for recruiters, candidates or indeed LinkedIn itself. So come on, are there any challengers out there? <strong><em>Nostradamus rating – 1: For now this falls into the nonsense category, particularly given <a href=""http://blog.linkedin.com/2014/07/31/linkedins-q2-2014-earnings/"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn's latest quarterly results</a>, which are exceptional. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2014/02/27/workday-acquires-identified-a-potential-disruptive-move-in-recruiting/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">This analysis by Josh Bersin of Workday’s acquisition of Identified</a> makes for interesting reading</em></strong></p>, <p>And the bonus prediction…</p>, <p><strong>11. Marissa Mayer breaks (at least) one more HR taboo</strong></p>, <p>Ok, this one is not strictly limited to talent acquisition, but after sending the HR doves into hysteria with her cull on remote working and introduction of the stacked curve for ranking employees, it can only be a matter of time (maybe hours) before Yahoo’s publicity shy (I jest) CEO breaks another taboo. When it does happen expect an avalanche of criticism and the odd smidgen of praise. <strong><em>Nostradamus rating – 0: Marissa has been remarkably quiet on this front, but still has five months to get the HR doves in full throwing toys out of pram mode.</em></strong></p>, <p>So overall, not bad considering some of the predictions bordered on blind optimism.

With over half the year gone, now seems a good time to revisit those predictions and see whether they were Nostradamus or nonsense.</p>, <p>The first part is presented today with each prediction followed by the judgement. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140731073723-12091643-ten-predictions-for-talent-acquisition-in-2014-half-term-report-2-of-2?trk=mp-details-rr-rmpost"" target=""_blank"">Part 2 (Trends 6 to 10) can be read here</a>.</p>, <p><strong>#1 </strong><strong>The economy improves; the War for Talent intensifies</strong></p>, <p>It’s been a tumultuous journey since the crash of 2008, but the signs are that the patient is back on her feet and entering recovery mode. But what is good news for the economy, presents a real challenge for Talent Acquisition departments. Premium talent that has retrenched in the last few years will either be actively looking for the next career move or will be susceptible to an approach. The War for Talent (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140704062129-12091643-the-war-for-talent-after-17-years-is-it-time-for-a-new-idiom?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">isn’t it time for a new idiom?</a>) is set to intensify and organisations with antiquated, homogeneous resourcing models solely dependent on active candidate pools will find they are not fit for purpose. As companies hemorrhage talent or lose out on fresh blood to their competitors, the C-Level will start asking questions of their Directors of HR and Talent Acquisition, but will they be able to answer them? <strong><em>Nostradamus rating (out of 10) – 7: The heat is on (as Glenn Frey once sang) but there’s still room for it to get much hotter; and it will...</em></strong></p>, <p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Talent Economics – the keys to the kingdom</strong></p>, <p>In simple terms, Talent Economics means recognising that to prosper in the intensifying War for Talent (oh dear, that idiom again), organisations will need to segment and personalise their approach to acquiring and engaging talent. It takes less effort, sophistication and cost to fill some roles than others, but many organisations – irrespective of whether they have an in-house or RPO model – apply the same approach across the board. ‘One size fits all’ models simply will not work anymore. They are inefficient in that too much cost and/or effort is applied to some roles and not enough to others. Just as Nicholas Lovell’s excellent book <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Curve-Freeloaders-Superfans-Future-Business/dp/0670923834/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387090793&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+curve"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘The Curve’</a> explains that the future of business is about variation: tailoring products for customers of all stripes; so organisations will need to vary their approach to engaging with and hiring different segments of talent. We recognised this some time ago at Cielo and refer to these segments as ‘Talented Many’, 'Skilled Few’ and ‘Expert One’ (see figure above). Interested? <a rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Get in touch</a> to find out more. <strong><em>Nostradamus rating – 8: Excusing the shameless promotion (apologies for that), we are seeing a marked increase in organisations taking a more intelligent segmented approach to how they hire.</em></strong></p>, <p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Employer Brand goes into orbit</strong></p>, <p>Most organisations get how important their consumer brand is but neglect to give equal focus to their employer brand. Of course they are equally important especially when you consider that great products and services (and by linkage customers) need great talent to shape, design and deliver them. You can’t have one without the other and when that talent is scarce and in high demand, the messages and communication strategies used to spark potential candidate interest is paramount. Similarly, just as a varied hiring strategy is integral for the ‘Talented Many’, ‘Skilled Few’ and ‘Expert One’, so a personalised and nuanced employer brand that resonates with different target groups is compulsory. Cielo is unique in the global RPO space by having its own in-house full service brand practice. <a href=""http://talent.linkedin.com/blog/index.php/2013/11/how-talent-acquisition-can-boost-your-company-performance-by-36"" target=""_blank""> Research from Lippincott and LinkedIn</a> found companies with strong consumer and employer brands financially outperform their peers by 36%. So it is perhaps not surprising that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andycurlewis"" target=""_blank"">Andy Curlewis</a>, who heads up our Global Brand, Digital and Comms practice, has been rushed off his feet in 2013. As employer brand goes into orbit , I expect that his feet won’t even touch the floor in 2014. Serves him right for being a Gooner! <strong><em>Nostradamus rating – 8: I’m pleased to write that Andy has been busier than Arsenal keeper </em></strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl6iIgSvXZI"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Wojciech Szczęsny at Anfield</em></strong></a><strong><em> back in February this year. What was the score again, Andy? </em></strong></p>, <p><strong>4. </strong><strong>Focus on metrics shifts to outcomes not cost of hire</strong></p>, <p>Five years of relentless cost-cutting since the onset of the financial crisis with regards to how most organisations hire will reach a tipping point in 2014. For too long there has been an obsession with cost per hire metrics and when this becomes the only objective this is counterproductive. Sadly, this is a game we see too many in-house functions and RPO providers willing to play. There aren’t many decisions more important to a business than determining who it hires. A cheap approach that leads to poor hires is one of the worst decisions a business can make given all the possible costs associated with making a poor hire and the benefits of snaring the right talent. As this realisation dawns (and a buoyant economy will only exacerbate this), organisations will need to shift emphasis to data on outcomes of hiring over costs of hiring and demand this from in-house functions and external partners alike. <strong><em>Nostradamus rating – 4: Sadly whilst all of this is true, cost still holds sway over agility, quality and outcomes. This revolution is taking longer than envisaged, but we are on to </em></strong><strong><em><a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/resources/blogs-and-social/cielos-hr-leader-blog/2014/july/16/the-unfortunate-rise-of-nickel-and-diming-in-the-rpo-industry/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the nickel and diming RPOs</a>. Talking about data...</em></strong><strong><em><br/></em></strong></p>, <p><strong>5. </strong><strong>It’s all about the data, baby</strong></p>, <p>2014 will be the year that HR stops talking about (or even avoiding) big data and embraces it wholesale like its cousins in Finance and Marketing; not necessarily to replace traditional HR intuition but to validate it. As recruiting converges ever closer with marketing (see Employer Brand trend above), it is only natural that the tools and techniques utilised to target potential consumers will be tailored to target desirable talent audiences. Moreover, predictive analytics that will enable talent acquisition functions to gain visibility on future requirements and the probability of success for potential new hires will mean that they will be able to make the kinds of decisions that will set them and their organisations up for long-term success. <strong><em>Nostradamus rating – 2: Hmm it seems my cup of optimism overfloweth (too much eggnog in the run-up to Christmas?). HR is still strangely resistant to embracing big data and especially predictive analytics.

David R.

Being a resilient sort of chap, the HRD had swiftly dusted himself down and formulated a plan to get to grips with a subject he knew little about and had previously assumed to be the preserve of the Finance and Marketing departments.</p>, <p>So will the HRD flounder or flourish at this unexpected opportunity to get HR on the top-table? Will he get funky on the HR Analytics dancefloor or will his attempt to get data on the HR agenda prove as embarrassing as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZmfZ_rRAus"" target=""_blank"">Boris and Dave’s Dad dancing</a> at the 2012 Olympics?</p>, <p>Well it’s been a couple of months and our HRD has been busy…</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>Don't call me <del>baby</del> Moyes...</strong></p>, <p>Whilst he resented his CEO for the arduous task that had been imposed upon him, it had dawned on the HRD that Dear Leader was correct (for the first time actually when it came to HR) in that the HRD needed to get his act together and fast. His colleagues had taken to calling him ‘Moyes’ and he knew if he didn’t get it right the knives would be out just as they had been for Alex Ferguson’s hapless successor at Manchester United.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>That chap Bersin</strong></p>, <p>As revealed in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140602143409-12091643-getting-started-with-hr-analytics-an-hr-director-s-tale-part-1?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a>, the HRD had immersed himself in HR Analytics books, white papers, blogs and on-line discussion groups as well as partaking in one of his favourite activities – hobnobbing at conferences. At one of these he’d met a chap called <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin"" target=""_blank"">Bersin</a> who had introduced him to his <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/lexicon/Details.aspx?id=15302"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">four-stage HR Analytics maturity model</a> outlining how organisations evolve from highly scalable reporting systems to advanced analytics. Whilst this had been helpful, the HRD conceded that they might have to invent a Stage Zero for his company.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>The mythical beasts of HR Analytics</strong></p>, <p>His plan had started to form when he attended the <a href=""http://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/HR-analytics-london-2014/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR &amp; Workforce Analytics Innovation Summit</a> in London. At first he had thought he must be in the wrong place. A significant proportion of the delegates had not spent their whole careers in HR - the horror. He had been stunned to learn that Shell’s HR Analytics team comprised a statistician and a clever chap with two Economics degrees. The HRD felt like a bit of a dinosaur but had quickly realised that he didn’t need to (and probably couldn’t) do it all himself and would actually progress quicker if he could get a boffin or two in.</p>, <p>He had heard that genuine HR Analytics expertise was hard to come by but here he was in a room full of legions of the mythical beasts. He collected a plethora of business cards – no expense would be spared to get the right expertise in. The HRD also resolved to sniff around the Finance department for any nascent talent. He now understood that he needed someone who could make sense of and create compelling stories and insight from the myriad of data that existed in the nether regions of his HR systems.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>A twin-pronged attack</strong></p>, <p>At the summit he liked what he had heard from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/vanessa-varney/4/669/416"" target=""_blank"">Vanessa Varney</a> of Coca-Cola Enterprises. Their journey seemed to be a prime example of building your HR Analytics house from the bottom up – à la what that chap Bersin had been banging on about in his four stage model.</p>, <p>Given the notorious impatience of his CEO he was excited at what <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> of ABN AMRO had told him over lunch. They had adopted a two-speed approach to scaling their analytics mountain by getting the operational reporting right in parallel with experimenting with some predictive analytics. The HRD knew it was the latter the CEO was demanding – “<a href=""http://www.personneltoday.com/hr/big-data-hr-needs-stop-reporting-start-predicting/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">stop reporting and start predicting</a>” the HRD had been harangued with in the staff canteen the other day. If he could dress it up with a big dollar saving sign hanging over it all the better. This would enable the HRD to be more van Gaal than Moyes.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>Start with the business problem</strong></p>, <p>Being about as numerate as his pet poodle, the HRD had been relieved to hear that not a single person he spoke to about HR Analytics had suggested that you should start with the data. Instead, the advice he continually received was that you needed to begin with the business problem. This was not only easier, but was something where he could actually contribute. For example, his recruitment function was in a bit of a mess – agency hiring had historically been too prevalent (partly due to the HRD’s reluctance to say no to a boozy lunch) and as such hiring costs were too high, time to productivity of new hires was off the scale and attrition levels continued to be a bone of contention.</p>, <p>The HRD reasoned that getting his talent acquisition function ship-shape would be a good place to start and if he could use data to diagnose the problems and help drive the solutions, all the better. He booked a meeting with his Head of Recruitment for the following afternoon. His HR Analytics journey was beginning to get funkier by the minute. Tune in next time for Part 3 to see how he gets on with presenting his plan to the CEO.</p>, <p><em>The HR Director ‘starring’ in this series is entirely fictitious.

Wibble... </em></p>, <p>To echo <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttcboE1GrNg"" target=""_blank"">Bloc Party’s career high</a> business is in a continual ‘state of flux’ as we transition from the certainties and rigidity of the organisational age to a climate that is increasingly more unpredictable, complex, collaborative, knowledge-based and global.</p>, <p>Back in 1997, when Kele and the rest of Bloc Party were still in short trousers, Manchester United had a decent football team (yes, it really was that long ago) and yours truly started his HR and recruitment career. It was also the year that McKinsey coined the term ‘The war for talent’ to describe the increasingly competitive landscape for recruiting and retaining talented employees.</p>, <p>It was a term that resonated widely and one that has been used ad verbatim ever since, but 17 years on isn’t the phrase becoming a little tiresome? If there was a war (and as far as I know no shots have actually been fired), then it is over; talent has won.</p>, <p>In any case, ‘war’ has negative connotations for most people – especially those caught in the crossfire – and an effective talent management strategy should rather accentuate the positive. Moreover, given in 2014 we are commemorating the 100 year anniversary of World War I – supposedly the war to end all wars – maybe it is time to call a ceasefire on the war for talent.</p>, <p>Staying with The Great War for the moment, Blackadder Goes Forth (despite what Education Secretary Michael Gove believes) was a stark and satirical take on life in the trenches. If Lieutenant George and Captain Blackadder were sharing a cup of hot mud courtesy of batman Private Baldrick, the unlikely triumvirate would doubtless stress the need for a “cunning plan”.</p>, <p>Whilst this plan may not be ""as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University"", it does allow for a negative to be turned into a positive. Organisations should cast aside the khakis and instead focus on delivering excellence in talent management.</p>, <p>Indeed, organisations that excel at talent management dramatically outperform their peers. Research from the Corporate Leadership Council indicates that the average annual growth rate over a 20 year period for organisations that lead the way in talent management is 7.7% compared to just 0.6% for the laggards. As business becomes more complex, knowledge based and collaborative this gap is only likely to grow.</p>, <p>So what are the foundations of excelling at talent management? Whilst not exhaustive – this is a blog post not a thesis - the pointers below should prove a good basis from which to start:</p>, <p>Get all this right and your organisation should be well-placed to recruit, retain, develop and reward employees in a way that supports their business objectives. Sounds easy? Of course it isn’t even for the likes of Google, but it sure beats going over the top and venturing into no-mans land brandishing a bayonet.</p>, <p><em>David is a Director at </em><em><a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo</a> </em><em>(formerly known as Pinstripe &amp; Ochre House) and </em><em>has worked with a number of organisations to design talent acquisition and talent management programmes that drive growth and competitive advantage.

David R. Green,"June 16, 2014",Six takeways from the HR Analytics Innovation Summit,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140616150124-12091643-six-takeways-from-the-hr-analytics-innovation-summit/,"[<p class=""center""><em>iNostix's 'Evolving from Tracking to Predictive HR Analytics' model</em></p>, <p>I recently had the honour of chairing the <a href=""http://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/HR-analytics-london-2014/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR &amp; Workforce Analytics Innovation Summit</a> in London. There were c150 delegates in attendance and speakers from the likes of Shell, Unilever and Coca-Cola Enterprises. What made the summit such a pleasure to chair was that rather than the usual blend of vendors and industry experts, the floor was very much reserved for HR Analytics leaders themselves to outline their personal HR Analytics journeys. As opening speaker James Rule of Thomson Reuters remarked this enabled some “positive deviancy” to infiltrate proceedings.</p>, <p>Here are my key takeaways from what was a very productive two days:</p>, <p><strong>#1 – Start with the business challenge, not the data</strong></p>, <p>There was universal agreement that unless the work of the HR Analytics team is aligned to a specific business challenge or strategy, then the data needn't be analysed or measured. Effective HR Analytics should not be about HR falling into the common trap of creating data that is inward looking, but should be tied to the function’s impact on the business. Indeed, as James Stringer of Unilever succinctly answered his own question on how to get the C-Suite interested in HR Analytics – you put a monetary value on it. </p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>#2 Quite a lot of people in HR Analytics don’t have an HR background</strong></p>, <p>Many of the delegates were not HR careerists. For example, the team describing the impressive HR Analytics journey at Shell included a statistician and a chap with two Economics degrees. Neither had previously worked in HR. This prompted quite a contretemps in a lively panel debate on whether a background in HR was required to interpret the implications of the data. It would seem that a blend of the two is sensible with the mix depending on the stage of the journey each organisation is on. HR may be a dark art, but it is positively bright compared to the intricacies of data science.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>#3 Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) and HR Analytics make ideal bedfellows</strong></p>, <p>The general consensus was that these two areas are intrinsically linked. Patrick Coolen of ABN AMRO provided the perfect justification explaining that i) Analytics can help prove or disprove theories thus providing real value at the outset of SWP and ii) SWP is a more natural way for HR to engage with the business about their needs. We heard a number of examples as to how Strategic Workforce Planning and HR Analytics had provided clear business benefit. One speaker from a FTSE250 organisation explained how she had implemented a People Strategy hand-in-hand with the Business Strategy over the course of a three year business transformation. This has enabled the business to now fill 50% of hires internally, reduce annual recruitment spend by £1m and help shift Employee Engagement upwards by 16%. The results from a business perspective are even more impressive as the organisation has more than trebled its market capitalisation, achieved a two-and-a-half fold increase in its share price and is on the verge of entering the FTSE100. These are the types of figures guaranteed to get the C-Level giddy with excitement about HR.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>#4 Everyone’s HR Analytics journey is different</strong></p>, <p>If one was to read analyst reports by the likes of <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2013/10/07/big-data-in-human-resources-a-world-of-haves-and-have-nots/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin</a>, an HR leader seeking to embark on an HR Analytics voyage would likely deduce that the journey was a) likely to be long, and b) should follow a tried and tested progressive path of getting the basics right before considering the Holy Grail of predictive analytics. Whilst this appeared to be the journey undertaken by most of the organisations present there is no hard and fast rule. One financial services organisation for example, has adopted a dual approach through outsourcing reporting to a third party whilst in parallel embarking on predictive analytics with another partner.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>#5 Predictive HR Analytics is a relatively immature concept </strong></p>, <p>Whilst the general consensus was that predictive HR Analytics is still a relatively immature phenomenon – perhaps for the reasons illustrated in the graphic prefacing this post - a number of the delegates present concurred that their companies had started on the road to something that is guaranteed to get attention at C-Level. As one speaker sagely observed the weather forecast is predictive analytics. HR though still lags behind their cousins in Finance and Marketing in Predictive Analytics with Luk Smeyers of iNostix and author of the excellent <a href=""http://www.hrintelligenceblog.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Intelligence Blog</a> observing that HR is 5-10 years behind. This is an area where there is still much work to do.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>#6 The future for HR Analytics is exciting</strong></p>, <p>Judging by the calibre of the people relaying their HR Analytics journeys and the keen interest with which delegates from other prestigious organisations lapped it up, HR Analytics is set to explode. Indeed, when you consider the relative success of the organisations present to their peers within their respective industries, one could surmise that there is a positive correlation between the relative maturity of the HR Analytics function and the performance of the business. This is certainly borne out in one of the key findings to emerge from Cielo's <span>recent Talent Activation Index, which revealed a direct link between talent metrics and business success. The survey reports that respondents from high performing businesses are nine times (43% vs 5%) more likely to use sophisticated metrics to measure the quality of their workforce than low performing organisations. Data like this means that the future for HR Analytics is an exciting one.</span></p>, <p><span> </span></p>, <p><em>David is Director of Business Development for <a href=""http://www.cielotalent.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cielo</a> (formerly known as Pinstripe &amp; Ochre House) in Europe.

The chastened HR Director stumbles out of the CEO’s office having received an almighty rollicking. The CEO had just got back from a few days of hobnobbing with his peers and he was furious. The reason for his ire was the fact that he was so damn impressed with the HR Analytics the likes of GE had. He had heard how they had used this data to directly inform business strategy and that the positive impacts on business performance and bottom line had been marked.</p>, <p>Never one to be made to feel behind the curve in any way to his peers, the CEO wanted HR Analytics and he wanted it now. He’d given it to the HRD with both barrels and as the shellshocked recipient reflected, the CEO’s hairdryer treatment made Alex Ferguson’s look like a mere breeze in comparison. He now had a month to compile a plan on something he’d previously regarded as a mere fad – “Data in HR? What’s wrong with intuition?” the HRD muttered to himself.</p>, <p>Where was he going to start? Remembering that the CEO had blasted that “big data was the last chance for the HR function to be relevant in the business”, he resolved that he’d better begin at the start.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>Read some books</strong></p>, <p>First thing’s first the HRD thought, was to get on-line and download some reading material onto his Kindle. He was surprised at the number of books there were on HR Analytics and immediately felt a bit foolish. He really was a bit out of touch he had to admit to himself. He bought three books: <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/HR-Analytics-The-What-Why/dp/1492739162/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392393970&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=HR+analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Analytics: The What, Why and How</a> by Tracey Smith, <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Keeping-Up-Quants-Understanding-Analytics/dp/142218725X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392393932&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=thomas+davenport"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Keeping Up With The Quants</a> by Thomas Davenport and <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/People-Analytics-Technology-Transform-Business/dp/0133158314/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392393900&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ben+waber"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics</a> by Ben Waber.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>Join some LinkedIn Groups</strong></p>, <p>Having mentioned the predicament to his Generation Y daughter, the HRD had been advised to join a couple of LinkedIn groups focused on HR Analytics. After much searching and a couple of additional calls to his daughter to help him navigate his way around LinkedIn he found what seemed to be two excellent groups: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=7424059&amp;trk=my_groups-b-grp-v"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics: Data Driven HR</a> and what would become as time wore on a very familiar hang out for the HRD – <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=73460&amp;trk=my_groups-b-grp-v"" target=""_blank"">Measuring Human Capital</a>.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>Sign up to some HR Analytics blogs</strong></p>, <p>His daughter also advised the HRD to seek out and subscribe to some specialist blogs on HR Analytics. The HRD was flabbergasted at how many blogs they were. Some chap called Bersin was particularly ubiquitous so along with his <a href=""http://www.bersin.com/Blog/Default.aspx?id=cca52831-7111-4538-91e0-a2fbe9865f99"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Business of HR</a>, the HRD subscribed to the excellent <a href=""http://www.hrintelligenceblog.com/en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Intelligence Blog</a> and <a href=""http://mortenkamp.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">All About Human Capital</a>.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>Start utilising his Forbes and HBR subscriptions</strong></p>, <p>Last time the CEO went to Davos he came back and eulogised to the extended leadership team (the HRD wasn’t on the ACTUAL leadership team although he was beginning to think he might if he could crack this HR Analytics gig) about how they should all read the likes of Forbes, The Economist and Harvard Business Review. The HRD had wondered if this was really relevant to him preferring to occasionally browse the odd HR publication alongside his Harry Potter obsession but had signed up to the company paid subscriptions in any case. Now he was visibly shocked at the treasure trove of information he had had access to all along. It was going to take a month to read it all!</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>Go to a conference and network</strong></p>, <p>Being in HR, the HRD liked nothing better than going to a conference and networking with his peers. He wondered whether there were any conferences coming up where HR Analytics was one of the key themes. He was surprised to see that there were <a href=""http://www.hrintelligenceblog.com/en/?p=876"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">14 HR Analytics conferences in 2014</a> alone and asked his PA to sign him up to a couple straight away.</p>, <p> </p>, <p><strong>Get all James Bond with Google</strong></p>, <p>The HRD didn’t know much about HR Analytics (although he was already quickly beginning to learn) but he did have a nephew who worked at Google and he knew that when it came to HR Analytics, Google was the daddy. Indeed, his nephew had sent him an article that had appeared in The Atlantic entitled <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/10/how-google-uses-data-to-build-a-better-worker/280347/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">How Google Uses Data To Build A Better Worker</a>. He put in a call to see if his nephew could fix him up with a meeting with someone from Google’s People Analytics Department. He chuckled to himself, he would be like James Bond infiltrating Spectre except he would be going undercover at Google.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>This should give him the basics, the HRD thought. At least he’d know what HR Analytics actually was after all of this. Read Part 2 in a week or so to see how he gets on...</p>, <p><em> </em></p>, <p><em>All characters appearing in this work are entirely fictitious.
