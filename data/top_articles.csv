David R. Green,The 20 best HR Analytics articles of 2014,2015,Qtr1,Jan,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-2014-david-green/,"[<p>According to revered authorities such as Josh Bersin, 2015 promises to be the year that analytics goes mainstream in HR. As such, I thought it may be helpful to warm-up with a list of my favourite HR Analytics articles of 2014 (listed in no particular order):</p>, <p><strong>1. iNostix </strong>– <strong><a href=""http://www.inostix.com/blog/en/hr-analytics-will-transform-world-hiring/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">How HR Analytics will transform the world of hiring</a></strong> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/iNostix"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">@iNostix</a></p>, <p>Luk Smeyers and Jeroen Delmotte’s Leuven based firm iNostix is one of the most interesting and progressive vendors in the HR analytics space. This extends to their blog, which regularly churns out thoughtful and informative posts. The example selected persuasively provides five ways in which predictive analytics will transform recruiting.</p>, <p><strong>2. Patrick Coolen</strong> – <strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=vsrp_people_res_infl_post_title"" target=""_blank"">The 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics</a></strong> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/PatrickCoolen"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">@PatrickCoolen</a></p>, <p>Patrick has developed a formidable reputation for his work at ABN AMRO where he has introduced predictive analytics into the HR space. Here he provides his version of the 10 commandments - related of course to HR analytics. For more on what Patrick has achieved at ABN AMRO check out this piece on the iNostix blog: <em><a href=""http://www.inostix.com/blog/en/the-hr-analytics-journey-at-abn-amro-interview-with-patrick-coolen/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The HR Analytics Journey at ABN AMRO</a></em>.</p>, <p><strong>3.

It presents the case for and against HR Analytics being under the auspices of the HR department – they certainly provoked some healthy debate. If you were on the jury, how would you vote?</p>, <p><strong>4. Andrew Marritt</strong> – <strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141112084226-78008-the-5-types-of-hr-analytics-vendors?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">5 Types of HR Analytics Vendors</a></strong> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/AndrewMarritt"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">@AndrewMarritt</a></p>, <p>My co-chair at the <em><a href=""https://www.tucana-global.com/conference/people-analytics-2015"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics 2015 conference</a></em> is one of the leading authorities in the HR Analytics space through his <a href=""http://www.organizationview.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Organization View</em></a> business. Andrew has published a series of blogs on LinkedIn - and several white papers that are well worth getting hold of. This one classifying the five types of HR Analytics vendors is a must-read for any CHRO considering ramping up their analytics efforts in 2015.</p>, <p><strong>5.

In this detailed Deloitte University Press publication, Bersin and his cohorts outline how organisations can quickly go from talking (or even avoiding?) to delivering on HR analytics.</p>, <p><strong>9.

His article from October arguing that for the vast majority of organisations data in HR is rarely ‘big’ really resonates.</p>, <p><strong>12. Nathan R. Kuncel, Deniz S. Ones and David M.

David R. Green,The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,2016,Qtr1,Jan,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21-best-hr-analytics-articles-2015-david-green/,"[<p>The growth of analytics within HR has been steady rather than spectacular, but I sense that 2016 could be the year of the great leap forward. Only 10-15% of organisations have what could be termed as ‘mature’ people analytics functions, but interest levels amongst the other 85-90% has arguably never been higher.</p>, <p>As such, this collection of my favourite people analytics articles of 2015 should be a useful resource for those interested in this subject. It includes contributions from ‘in-house’ practitioners, vendors, analysts, influencers and commentators on the people analytics space.</p>, <p>So, in no particular order, let’s get started…</p>, <p><strong>1. Josh Bersin | <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-takes-off-ten-things-weve-learned-josh-bersin"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics Takes Off: 10 Things We’ve Learned</a></strong></p>, <p>The first of two entries by Josh Bersin examines the ‘State of the Market’ for people analytics and includes a number of fascinating findings including i) growth will be exponential, but we are still in the early days, ii) most companies still don't really know what People Analytics really is, iii) modelling is valuable but implementing models (i.e. change management) is key, and iv) we have to work together - we are all learning now – i.e. (and to borrow from Lars Schmidt’s and Ambrosia Vertesi’s <em><a href=""http://hros.co/hros/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">#HROS initiative</a></em>) HR Analytics Open Source.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" data-li-src=""//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/sib0bdvswg8qgi"" frameborder=""0"" height=""355"" src=""about:blank"" width=""425""></iframe></p>, <p><strong>2.

This article provides his retrospective view of 2015 and confirms my own impression (and that of Josh Bersin’s above) that analytics has gathered significant momentum with HR leaders over the last 12 months – marvellous news for all of us operating in this burgeoning space.</p>, <p><strong>3. Inside HR |</strong> <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/what-hr-metrics-are-investors-interested-in/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>What HR Metrics Are Investors Most Interested In?</strong></a></p>, <p>This article in <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Inside HR</em></a> reports on a joint study between Harvard Law School and the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute. It reveals the growing interest from the investment community into the correlation between human capital and financial outcomes such as return on equity, return on investment and profit margins. The study (<em><a href=""http://irrcinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FINAL-Human-Capital-Materiality-April-23-20151.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">see full report</a></em>) establishes a meaningful connection between the two implying that “companies with a convincing HR story and strong data to back it up are likely to receive a welcome reception from many institutional investors.”</p>, <p><strong>4.

As well as generating better talent outcomes in terms of leadership pipelines, cost reductions, efficiency gains and mobility, perhaps the most telling finding was that the share prices of these pioneering 14% outpaced the S&amp;P 500 by an average 30% from 2011-14. If that doesn’t make the case for people analytics, I'm not sure what does.</p>, <p><strong>5.

The first 100 days are critical to the success of any business initiative, which makes this white paper all the more indispensable for would be HR analytics leaders. Aspirants are guided through a series of steps, collectively designed to lead to maximise impact within those priceless first 100 days.</p>, <p><strong>6.

And how can you get senior leaders to realise that just because sometimes these variables are hard to measure doesn’t mean you shouldn’t bring better science to them?”</p>, <p><strong>13.

The first half of my year has seen me speaking at and chairing people analytics conferences in San Francisco, Amsterdam, London, Sydney and New York. </p>, <p>My travels have confirmed that: i) some great work is being done in the people analytics space, ii) interest in the subject has risen sharply, and; iii) (dare I say it) adoption levels are also increasing. Long may all three indicators continue to move in an upwards trajectory.</p>, <p>The first half of 2016 has also seen a wealth of fabulous articles published. As such, I hope this collection of some of the best proves an invaluable resource for colleagues working in the space and those interested in learning more.

David R. Green,The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,2016,Qtr4,Dec,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green/,"[<p>If the Christmas classic that is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HkJHApgKqw"" target=""_blank"">Stop the Cavalry</a> by Jona Lewie is playing on the radio, it must mean that 2016 is nearing its end. The year has simply flown by.</p>, <p>I’m in the fortunate position to have a unique view of the developing space of people analytics. 2016 has seen plenty of great work being done (see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-ii-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-more-people-analytics-case-studies-part-i-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), and interest levels in the subject have soared. Adoption levels are still lagging, with the rise in organisations embracing a data-driven approach to HR being steady rather than spectacular.</p>, <p>Selecting the best people analytics articles of the second half of 2016 has been a momentous task given both the quality and quantity of articles that are now being published. Even refining down to my favourite 40 has been a difficult and time-consuming process. As ever, I hope the collection proves an invaluable resource for colleagues working in the space and those interested in learning more. Enjoy and do let me know in the comments section, any articles I may have missed.</p>, <p>In no particular order…</p>, <p>One of the smartest HR leaders I’ve had the pleasure to come across, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/placidjover"" target=""_blank"">Placid Jover</a> was recently appointed to lead HR for Unilever’s £3 billion UK business. Previously, Placid had established and led Unilever’s global Organisation Performance and HR Analytics team. In this thoughtful article, Placid reflects on his experiences, how the space has evolved and what the future holds for analytics and how it will underpin HR. Placid's observations on the field are fascinating. This really is a must-read.</p>, <p>The evening before publishing, this tremendous article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a> of LinkedIn landed in my inbox causing me to make a last-minute change to the final 40. It recounts the story of how LinkedIn’s talent acquisition team couldn’t fill roles fast enough as the organisation grew by over 40% a year. Analytics were employed to build visibility and accountability into the hiring process. The results were astounding. The model that was built was able to predict within 5% actual numbers hired. Even more impressive is the fact that the intervention saved the company 15% of its recruiting budget in year one, which covered the cost of the investment in LinkedIn’s Talent Analytics team for more than 4 years. You see, this was simply too good to leave out! The Slideshare below, which was presented by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifershappley"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Shappley</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/phamchristopher"" target=""_blank"">Chris Pham</a> at Talent Connect, also covers this outstanding project. If case studies on people analytics are your thing see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-ii-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-more-people-analytics-case-studies-part-i-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The people analytics space is evolving quickly so it was definitely time for <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> to update his much-loved 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics. The result is the best version yet as not only has Patrick employed crowdsourcing techniques for what is v3.0, but he has also taken the time to highlight examples of the research he and his team have conducted at ABN AMRO. My favourite rule? That has to be a tie between #2 ‘Only do business relevant research’ and #3 ‘Create actionable insights’. Read more on the people analytics journey at ABN AMRO <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Whilst HR is “the new kid on the block” in the business when it comes to analytics this doesn't have to be an obstacle providing the function is prepared to leverage experiences from elsewhere in the organisation. In this perceptive article in the <a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">MIT Sloan Management Review</a>, the authors describe four lessons from customer analytics that can easily be applied to people analytics. This is a must-read for budding and experienced analytics practitioners alike.   </p>, <p>Bersin by Deloitte’s recent <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/business-talent-hr-predictions-2017-everything-becoming-josh-bersin"" target=""_blank"">2017 HR Predictions</a> is pretty bullish in its assertion that the next 12 months will see analytics move from a niche group in HR to an important operational business function (I certainly hope so!). This is borne out in this positive market analysis by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, Bersin’s People Analytics Research Leader. Madhura highlights three emerging trends in the space: i) the need for people analytics to add value to the business; ii) analytics as the new normal for HR; and iii) the critical role of technology. Look out for Bersin’s High-Impact People Analytics study, when it is published in 2017. </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: People Analytics maturity is growing (Source: Bersin by Deloitte, 2017 HR Predictions)</em></p>, <p>As I’ve toured the conference circuit in 2016, the issue of ethics and trust invariably crops up when the subject turns to people analytics. <a href=""http://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> believes that trust is the most important part of doing great people analytics, and I’m inclined to agree with him. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data. Not only does it affect the quality of data available, it also makes people analytics initiatives unsustainable. The Virtuous Circle of Data Quality (see Figure 2 below), conceptualised by Andrew, provides a convincing case for placing employee trust at the heart of any people analytics strategy.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: The Virtuous circle of data quality (Source: Andrew Marritt | Organization View)</em></p>, <p>In just a few short months, <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> has rapidly emerged as one of the premier resources for those working and interested in the people analytics space. Ticking both the quantity and quality boxes, there is a wealth of excellent proprietary and third party content to choose from. Choosing just one article was difficult, but I’ve plumped for this excellent piece by <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> on five reasons why HR Analytics projects fail. It’s an invaluable guide on the pitfalls to avoid for anyone working in a people analytics role, especially those just getting started – as is the recent book (<a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/ebook-basic-principles-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>The basic principles of People Analytics</em></a>) Erik and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/nandosteenhuis"" target=""_blank"">Nando Steenhuis</a> have published. I was so impressed that I happily agreed to write the foreword. </p>, <p>Failure, or more pertinently how to avoid it, is also the subject of this fabulous article by <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, one of the leading consultants and influencers in the field. The article is designed to help budding aspirants harness people analytics, and avoid project failure, by presenting a systematic, cost-effective methodology for creating robust data sets that correlate. It’s an eminently readable resource full of great advice and tips to avoid the many pitfalls that can befall even the pluckiest of novices. See Max speak at <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> in London on 25-26 April.</p>, <p>This article, which captures the main findings of the authors’ provocative <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1748-8583.12090/abstract"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">white paper</a>, asserts that the lack of progress with analytics is in part down to the lack of analytical understanding on the part of HR, whilst also apportioning blame to an industry touting expensive and complex products. The authors then offer some tips around developing an analytical mindset, focusing on the business, data governance and building the right skills and capabilities to conduct analytics. </p>, <p>Whilst acknowledging his own excitement about the role people analytics will play in transforming organisations, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation"" target=""_blank"">Andy Spence</a> correctly asserts that despite the hype adoption rates remain frustratingly low. He then describes seven challenges HR needs to overcome, as well as providing some astute advice to help practitioners succeed. Read the article alongside the accompanying Slideshare below. </p>, <p>Whilst I wrote this article, credit for the content has to go to <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> (and her co-authors <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a> and <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>), hence me being able to include it in this collection. During research for their upcoming book <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">“The Power of People: How Successful Organizations Use Workforce Analytics To Improve Business Performance”</a>, Dr. Feinzig and her co-authors found three categories of resistance that organisations need to overcome: i) stakeholder scepticism, ii) financial frugalness and iii) HR hesitancy. This article describes these three areas as well as providing recommendations as to how they can be overcome.  </p>, <p>Many organisations choose to get started with people analytics by conducting a needs analysis with their HR colleagues. In this indispensible article, <a href=""http://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> of <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a> questions this approach and instead offers his own guide for CHROs looking to get started. I particularly like Luk’s suggestion that the people analytics function should be the right-hand ‘intelligence service’ of the CHRO - data driven HR indeed.</p>, <p>Those looking to make a case for investing in people analytics in their organisations would do well to utilise the evidence presented here by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a>. The article highlights research by Sierra-Cedar demonstrating organisations with workforce analytics and data-driven decision making outperform those that don’t. The four characteristics of these “quantified” organisations are then outlined. Compelling stuff!</p>, <p>The glacial pace of progress in people analytics is perhaps not surprising since HR is trying to remake itself in an entirely new image, in an environment where supply of new analytical talent—and budget to hire them—is extremely limited. This article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a> (also a <a href=""http://twitter.com/EvanSinar"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">must-follow on Twitter</a>) and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/richwellins"" target=""_blank"">Rich Wellins</a> describes the skills and traits HR needs, how well (or not) the function is prepared (see Figure 3 below) and the relationships in the business that can best help propel HR forward. </p>, <p><em>Figure 3: What HR needs to thrive with Analytics (Source: DDI)</em></p>, <p>The field of people analytics has attracted many bright young things that otherwise probably wouldn’t have considered a career in HR. <a href=""http://de.linkedin.com/in/stefan-hierl-1488932"" target=""_blank"">Stefan Hierl</a>, who leads people analytics at Adidas is one such example. This article in the superb <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside HR</a> describes the three core pillars of Adidas’ people analytics strategy: i) align with the business to define what success looks like, ii) use data and insights to improve the employee experience, and iii) support broader strategic decision-making. </p>, <p>As <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, Head of Global Workforce Analytics at Experian, testifies in this article, many organisations are still swimming in the slow lane when it comes to workforce analytics. As he goes on to state, it doesn’t have to be a struggle, and this is even less likely to be the case if organisations and nascent analytics leaders follow the excellent advice in this article. Effective stakeholder management, building a balanced team and prioritising education and awareness are just three of the tips provided.</p>, <p>Having a CHRO who not only sponsors but is involved in the people analytics initiative is a common factor I have seen in organisations that are successful in this space. One such CHRO is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-herena-b55464a4"" target=""_blank"">Monique Herena</a> of BNY Mellon. In this article, she outlines the guiding principles she has followed to establish people analytics capability at the bank. </p>, <p>Another CHRO who has written about their organisation’s people analytics journey is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a>. This article describes how Microsoft is using analytics to help employees and teams to become more productive. More importantly, it also tackles the question of employee trust. Hogan emphasises that the purpose is to empower rather than undermine employee decision-making and articulates her vision of creating the ability for employees to own their data, improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance. Read more on Microsoft’s people analytics journey with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The second entry from the excellent <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside HR</a> comes from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/christadegnan"" target=""_blank"">Christa Degnan Manning</a> of <a href=""http://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin by Deloitte</a>. It describes four emerging trends that are increasingly shaping the field of people analytics. The main trend featured is how companies are using previously untapped sources of data (e.g. social media, biometrics, wearables) to derive insights to help tackle pressing people challenges. The other trends featured are: i) tools to support more frequent and real-time measurement; ii) integration of data from disparate sources; and iii) easier, faster analytics and visualisation of data. Speaking of which…</p>, <p>Sentiment analysis has long been used by organisations to better understand its customers and, as this piece in The Atlantic reports, is now increasingly being used by forward-thinking organisations to get invaluable insights on their employees. The article provides two excellent examples from Twitter and IBM – indeed the latter used an internally developed sentiment-analysis tool called Social Pulse to engage its employees in a revamp of its performance-review system. </p>, <p>Do algorithms completely eliminate bias and prejudice from hiring? Of course not and indeed, as described by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/gideon-mann-223a2912"" target=""_blank"">Gideon Mann</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cathy O’Neil</a> in this HBR piece, left to their own devices algorithms can even exacerbate bias - humans make them after all. The article examines this challenge and advocates the continual audit and modification of algorithms to limit inequity. As algorithms take on a larger role, HR professionals will do well to heed the advice offered here.</p>, <p>How do you engage HRBPs and make them “consumers of analytics”? This was the weighty challenge set for the first Human Capital Analytics hackathon held by Copenhagen Business School. The solutions are nicely summarised in this article by <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/saskia-menke-788b9ba0/en"" target=""_blank"">Saskia Menke</a>. It is certainly an important challenge for organisations if they are to scale analytics and create a sustainable capability across HR, so the findings make for interesting reading. </p>, <p>We read a lot about <a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/demystifying-people-analytics-part-3-the-power-of-storytelling/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">storytelling in people analytics</a>, which as <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> acknowledges in this article is one of the core requisites for success in this field. However, as Andersen goes on to argue, storytelling on its own can actually be harmful if you do not have a plausible and well-documented theory behind your data. Certainly, the example he provides in the article on leadership effectiveness by gender presents a convincing case.</p>, <p>Many organisations decide to build a Centre of Excellence (CoE) as part of its attempt to develop people analytics capability. In this piece, <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/manojkumarhranalytics"" target=""_blank"">Manoj Kumar</a>, who led HSBC’s HR Analytics CoE for five years, outlines five reasons why a CoE may not deliver ROI within expected timelines whilst also suggesting fixes to each of these challenges. I can also highly recommend Manoj’s <a href=""http://talkinghranalytics.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talking HR Analytics</a> blog as an excellent resource for those working or interested in the field. </p>, <p>A key outcome of many people analytics projects is that the insights are counterintuitive to the common wisdom of many HR (and business) leaders. This article in the McKinsey Quarterly provides three such case studies in the areas of sourcing, screening and attrition. The last example in particular resonates where the finding that employees in smaller teams, with longer periods between promotions and with lower-performing managers, were more likely to leave led to a far more tailored and focused approach.</p>, <p>Another practitioner article comes from <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/sidshishoo"" target=""_blank"">Sidhartha Shishoo</a> of Genpact on the excellent <a href=""http://www.peoplematters.in/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Matters</a> site. The article describes some of the challenges Genpact faced when embarking on its people analytics journey including i) separating analytics from reporting, ii) data quality, iii) building capability and iv) employee privacy. It’s an outstanding article and one that emphasises the need for boldness: in thinking, in strategy and in application when it comes to people analytics.</p>, <p><a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> makes a couple of points in this article that really resonate. When it comes to people analytics i) the sense of urgency is missing in too many organisations, and ii) instead of talking about it, just get started. Tom then outlines five steps to getting started.</p>, <p>Being a mathematician, prolific writer and consultant <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> tables 13 (it’s a prime!) ideas for the budding people analytics aspirant to get started. Together, these cover the whole gamut of people operations from recruiting through to engagement, performance and retention – all with the emphasis on providing business value. Plenty to inspire here.</p>, <p><a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> trains HR practitioners through his ‘Practical People Analytics’ course (and very good it is too, by all accounts). This article describes some of the lessons this experience has taught him such as the need to i) differentiate between reporting and analytics, ii) embrace rather than eschew traditional HR intuition and iii) collaborate and share. Read the article for further insights.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/beneubanks"" target=""_blank"">Ben Eubanks</a> (check out his <a href=""http://upstarthr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Upstart HR blog</a>) is one of the best of the new breed of HR analysts, so it is good to read that he believes the subject of analytics is getting serious traction amongst leaders. Similar to the article above by Sam Hill, Eubanks recognises that HR sometimes struggles to differentiate between the different types of analytics, so this definition of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive should prove a helpful resource for many.</p>, <p>Google is the poster organisation for people analytics and there have been countless articles written about their phenomenal success in this space. These two rank amongst the best. First, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/stgmaier/en"" target=""_blank"">Steffen Meier</a> describes Google’s data-driven approach and use of employee feedback to optimise its people processes and culture. He also summarises Project Oxygen (on leadership) and Project Aristotle (on team effectiveness). The New York Times article provides a fascinating and detailed description of Aristotle, which is an essential read. </p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The five key factors of team effectiveness at Google (Source: re:Work, Project Aristotle)</em></p>, <p>Google is also featured in hiQ Labs head honcho <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal"" target=""_blank"">Darren Kaplan</a>’s tribute to its former HR head <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a>, who announced he was stepping down from his role at the tech giant earlier this year. As Kaplan rightly asserts, Bock is one of the (if not ‘the’) most influential figures in people analytics and data driven HR and all of us in the space have a lot to be grateful to him for. Some of Kaplan’s colleagues at hiQ also deserve a mention and I also highly recommend reading these three articles: i) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhousman"" target=""_blank"">Michael Housman</a> reports on the recent hiQ Elevate awards as well as providing an astute analysis of the space, ii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/teuschb"" target=""_blank"">Ben Teusch</a> makes a plea for more articles at the ‘micro level’, which offer explanations of which kinds of analyses are useful for people analytics, and; iii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-a-hammond"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Hammond</a> on the opportunity and challenge of the cognitive funnel in people analytics. Quite a quartet of articles there. </p>, <p>One of the most interesting HR Tech firms I’ve come across is <a href=""http://www.saberr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Saberr</a>, who focus on making teams work well together. They’ve also employed research methods to understand how values operate at different levels of the organisation (individual, team and organisation). CEO <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/tom-marsden-b04282"" target=""_blank"">Tom Marsden</a> details the methodology and findings from the research in this engrossing article. </p>, <p><em>Figure 5: How values impact organisations (Source: Saberr)</em></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/burkepowers"" target=""_blank"">Burke Powers</a>, who leads people data, reporting and analytics at PayPal, is an advocate of design thinking to get greater understanding and adoption when tackling any analytics project. In this excellent article, Burke outlines his theory and uses eight case study examples from the likes of Google, KPMG and Microsoft as evidence of the benefits of placing design thinking at the heart of an analytics project. </p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>’s Future of Work podcast is always worth a listen and this is certainly the case when it comes to this episode featuring <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a>, CEO of <a href=""http://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a>, a social sensing and analytics platform that uses sensors in employee ID badges to drive team effectiveness and engagement. Waber offers some fascinating observations on the people analytics space, not least i) start small, but do something that makes you uncomfortable and outside of your comfort zone, ii) if you don’t start people analytics in the next two years it will be hard to catch up with those that have, and iii) on average people analytics increases top line performance by 10-15%.</p>, <p>One of the reasons tabled by HR for being unable to get started with people analytics is data quality (or the lack of it). There’s no doubt that you need to be able to justify your data when challenged, but at the same time the desire for the nirvana of 100% clean data is wholly unrealistic. This outstanding article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-kennedy-a936283"" target=""_blank"">Cameron Kennedy</a> guides the would-be analyst through some of the pitfalls and offers plenty of practical tips on collecting, cleaning and analysing data. </p>, <p>A regular entrant in my collection of the best articles on people analytics is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-roberts-b0217"" target=""_blank"">Greta Roberts</a>. In this short and sweet piece, Greta makes a simple but important observation on how HR is often misaligned to the business because it doesn’t measure the same goals. In analytics, we teach the importance of focusing on the business first and foremost, so perhaps it is in adopting people analytics that HR can find its way out of the morass Greta highlights.</p>, <p>If people analytics is to become a core part of HR’s repertoire and underpin the function of the future, the teaching of HR has to have a heavy emphasis on data, science and analytics within its curricula.

David R. Green,The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,2017,Qtr1,Jan,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/30-best-hr-analytics-articles-2016-david-green/,"[<p>People Analytics and data driven HR continues to generate huge amounts of interest amongst those working in or associated with the field of human resources.</p>, <p>The potential analytics has to underpin the future transformation of HR with regards to digital, personalising the employee experience and identifying actionable insights that lead to better business outcomes is recognised by many but to date has only been realised by few.</p>, <p>For the last three years, I’ve collected what I believe are the best people analytics articles of the preceding 12 months. The purpose is to (hopefully) provide a useful resource for those already operating in or those who aspire to work in the field of people analytics (see collections from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-2014-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2014</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21-best-hr-analytics-articles-2015-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2015</em></a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/27-best-hr-analytics-articles-h1-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2016 Jan-Jun</em></a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2016 Jul-Dec</em></a>).</p>, <p>I have been motivated to do this ‘Best of 2016’ piece because I missed (either due to publication date or my own human error) seven articles from my previous two 2016 collections. These articles are too good not to be recognised, so without further ado and in no particular order…</p>, <p>It may seem strange to begin with an article that was published in 2015, but having somehow not included it 12 months ago, it only seems fair to start with what is one of the most important articles on people analytics I have read. The white paper provides a critique of the HR centric approach adopted by the majority of organisations when it comes to analytics and instead advocates an “outside-in” method targeted at solving real business problems. Two excellent examples from Maersk Drilling are highlighted to support the argument. Case 1 (see <em><strong>Figure 1</strong></em> below) examines the impact of leadership quality and crew competence on safety, operational performance, and customer satisfaction whilst Case 2 examines the ROI and Strategic Impact of a Technical Trainee Acceleration Program. As the article reveals, both cases show that analytics is far more effective when tackled from a business (rather than an inward looking HR) perspective and that analytics should be treated as a change management process. <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> is Vice-President of HR Data and Analytics at Shell, which is often (and rightly) cited as one of the leading practices on the planet. To find out more about what Shell is doing please see my interview <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-journey-shell-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> with <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a"" target=""_blank"">Esther Bongenaar</a> and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/vgiagkoulas"" target=""_blank"">Vasilis Giagkoulas</a>. </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: HR analytics in Maersk Drilling. Percentages shown are the squared correlations, i.e., amount of variance explained. Often HR Analytics teams will only link leadership quality and turnover (box 3), while a broad analytics approach looks at the entire value chain</em> <em> (Source: Maersk Drilling, Dave Ulrich &amp; Thomas Rasmussen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Another brilliant article – this time published just days after my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">H2 2016 collection</a> is this insightful and must-read piece by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-walter-3baa8a9"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Walter</a>, who leads Talent Strategy and Workforce Analytics at Gap. As Anthony correctly highlights, the volume of analytical insights continues to grow and whilst this is positive it is arguably a waste if these insights do not lead to <em><strong>meaningful</strong></em> actions that help <em><strong>drive</strong></em> business results. Anthony highlights four key areas of focus and suggests how these gaps between insights and action can be bridged. The four areas are: i) lack of alignment between business strategy and analytics, ii) missing skills in the analytics team (e.g. storytelling, influencing, consulting), iii) cultural impediments that block or slow down action, and; iv) the absence of feedback mechanisms to understand the impact of actions.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the smartest HR leaders I’ve had the pleasure to come across, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/placidjover"" target=""_blank"">Placid Jover</a> was recently appointed to lead HR for Unilever’s £3 billion UK business. Previously, Placid had established and led Unilever’s global Organisation Performance and HR Analytics team. In this thoughtful article, Placid reflects on his experiences, how the space has evolved and what the future holds for analytics and how it will underpin the HR of the future. Like the previous two articles, Placid emphasises the importance of focusing on insights that lead to business outcomes. A must-read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the previous article, Placid highlighted that Unilever is fortunate to have a CHRO who embraces data and lives and breathes the insight it brings to the organisation and people agendas. The role of the CHRO is pivotal, as <a href=""http://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a>, Co-Founder of <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a>, makes clear in this article for the <a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRN Blog</a>. Luk makes an impassioned plea for CHROs to work closely with their HR Analytics leader arguing that this is how HR can have a demonstrable impact on business results. The second article - an interview with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>, former HR Analytics leader and now CHRO, illustrates Luk’s point perfectly. Mark argues that when executed correctly people analytics can be the “<em>GPS of HR</em>”, as he answers with typical candour and insight a series of questions on people analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing Luk’s theme, having a CHRO who not only sponsors but is involved in driving the people analytics initiative is a common <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-constitutes-best-practice-people-analytics-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">best practice</a> I have seen in organisations that are successful in this space. One such CHRO is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a>. The first article describes how Microsoft is using analytics to help employees and teams to become more productive. More importantly, it also tackles the question of employee trust. Hogan emphasises that the purpose is to empower rather than undermine employee decision-making and articulates her vision of creating the ability for employees to own their data, improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance. Read more on Microsoft’s people analytics journey in my interview with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, who leads the HR Business Insights team <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and also an in-depth case study on the excellent <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valuing your Talent</a> site <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/research-resources/case-studies/microsoft"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>When I speak to people analytics leaders, the topic of ethics and trust is never far from the top of the list. <a href=""http://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> believes that trust is the most important part of doing great people analytics, and I’m inclined to agree with him. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data. Not only does it affect the quality of data available, it also makes people analytics initiatives unsustainable. The Virtuous Circle of Data Quality (see <em><strong>Figure 2</strong></em> below), conceptualised by Andrew, provides a convincing case for placing employee trust at the heart of any people analytics strategy.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: The Virtuous circle of data quality (Source: Andrew Marritt | Organization View)</em></p>, <p>One of the best events I attended last year was SHRM’s 18th Thought Leaders Retreat on using workforce analytics for competitive advantage. The event featured some of the leading academics and practitioners in the field and this article captures the many insights that were outlined and discussed over the two days. To pick just four examples: i) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a> highlighted that the value of analytics is in discovering how it can make a difference to the organisation, ii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> (see also Alec’s superb <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-solemnly-swear-hr-data-analytics-manifesto-alec-levenson?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">HR Analytics manifesto</a>) describing how analysing at the team level, rather than the individual level, can offer bigger returns, iii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>’s advice that sometimes it’s the quick wins that make leaders come back and ask for more, and; iv) that greater use of analytics requires HR leaders to think hard about ethical factors: what data is used, how it is used, how data is protected, and in what ways use of data and analytics might cross an ethical line. For more on using workforce analytics for competitive advantage also see <a href=""http://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/shapingthefuture/documents/eiu%20theme%203%20analytics%20report-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this white paper</a> published by SHRM two months prior to the retreat.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Intel's People Analytics methodology (Source: Alexis Fink | SHRM)</em></p>, <p>Published just a day after my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">H2 2016 collection</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra"" target=""_blank""><em>Amit Mohindra</em></a> was right to highlight that this superb article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzocanlas"" target=""_blank""><em>Lorenzo Canlas</em></a>, Head of Talent Analytics at LinkedIn, demanded inclusion. Lorenzo describes how his team has refined its mission to helping leaders use talent as a lever to achieve business objectives and how their success is defined as having a measurable impact to business or talent metrics. As Amit also commented the evolution Lorenzo describes from ""arming decision-makers"" to actively participating in the intervention/solution is game-changing. The financial return (see <em><strong>Figure 4</strong></em> below) of Lorenzo’s team demonstrates the significant impact that people analytics can have. Lorenzo goes on to cite several examples of the work his team has undertaken such as that impressively outlined in the second article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a>. This describes how a single project to better forecast and plan for how many recruiters were needed as the organisation scaled at over 40% a year, including where and when they were needed, predicted within 5% the actual numbers hired, saved the company 15% of its recruiting budget in year one and consequently paid for talent analytics for over four years. The Slideshare below, which was presented by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifershappley"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Shappley</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/phamchristopher"" target=""_blank"">Chris Pham</a> at Talent Connect, also recounts this outstanding project.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The ROI of LinkedIn's Talent Analytics team (Source: Lorenzo Canlas)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Storytelling is the last mile problem in analytics. Fail to develop a compelling story for your stakeholder and even great insights and analysis will be for nothing. In this article, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> highlights a <a href=""http://futurehrtrends.eiu.com/report-2016/executive-summary/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">study by SHRM</a> that reveals this is a skill lacking in many HR analytics efforts. He then recounts an excellent example of powerful storytelling from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>. Jonathan is co-writing a book - 'The Power of People' (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">pre-order here</a>) on people analytics, which is due to be published in May 2017 and will feature a whole chapter on storytelling from where <em><strong>Figure 5</strong></em> below is extracted. Can’t wait. Also on storytelling, the short video thereafter features <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a>, who leads Google’s fabled people analytics team. In it, Prasad distils effective communication into three key points that matter: what you want your audience to know, how you want them to feel, and what you want them to do. The basis for better storytelling in analytics starts here.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Three Principles of Storytelling (Source: The Power of People by Nigel Guenole, Sheri Feinzig &amp; Jonathan Ferrar)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The importance of storytelling also features prominently in <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a>‘s update of his much-loved 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics. The result is the best version yet as not only has Patrick used crowdsourcing for the update, but has also taken the time to highlight examples of the research he and his team have conducted at ABN AMRO. My favourite rule? That has to be a tie between #2 ‘Only do business relevant research’ and #3 ‘Create actionable insights’. Read more on the people analytics journey at ABN AMRO in my interview with Patrick <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The world’s premier analyst on all things HR gave his observations on the field of people analytics at the midpoint of 2016. The headline finding is that “<em>our research shows tremendous growth in this market, and a significant shift away from measuring HR toward a real focus on using people data to understand and predict business performance</em>”. Josh then outlines ten elements driving this growth. This is a great analysis of many of the factors I am also seeing in this space. The second article from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, Bersin’s People Analytics Research Leader, highlights three emerging trends: i) the need for people analytics to add value to the business; ii) analytics as the new normal for HR; and iii) the critical role of technology.

This excellent article (including <em><strong>Figure 7</strong></em> below) by <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen"" target=""_blank""><em>Morten Kamp Andersen</em></a>, not only outlines the six key skill areas Morten believes are required but also examines what happens when just one of those skills is missing. The second article is a wonderfully detailed white paper of a project Morten undertook with ISS to investigate whether and to what extent customer profitability is driven by customer experience and employee engagement.</p>, <p><em>Figure 7 - The six must-have competencies of a world-class people analytics team (Source: Morten Kamp Andersen)</em></p>, <p>As founder of the <a href=""http://www.talentstrategyinstitute.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Strategy Institute</a> and convenor of the <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work Conference</a>, (which, I am honoured to be co-hosting with Al on 2-3 Feb in San Francisco), <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> is one of the most popular and knowledgeable people in the field of people analytics.

Ticking both the quantity and quality boxes, there is a wealth of excellent proprietary and third party content to choose from. Choosing just one article was difficult, but I’ve plumped for this excellent piece by <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> on five reasons why HR Analytics projects fail. It’s an invaluable guide for anyone working in a people analytics role, especially those just getting started – as is the recent book (in which a version of the article also appears) (<a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/ebook-basic-principles-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>The basic principles of People Analytics</em></a>) Erik and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/nandosteenhuis"" target=""_blank"">Nando Steenhuis</a> have published. I was so impressed that I happily agreed to write the Foreword.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Failure, or more pertinently how to avoid it, is also the subject of this fabulous article by <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, one of the leading consultants and influencers in the field. The article is designed to help budding aspirants harness people analytics, and avoid project failure, by presenting a systematic, cost-effective methodology for creating robust data sets that correlate. It’s an eminently readable resource full of great advice and tips to avoid the many pitfalls that can befall even the pluckiest of novices. See Max speak at <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> in London on 25-26 April.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The glacial pace of progress in people analytics is perhaps not surprising since HR is trying to remake itself in an entirely new image, in an environment where supply of new analytical talent—and budget to hire them—is extremely limited. This article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a> (also a <a href=""http://twitter.com/EvanSinar"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">must-follow on Twitter</a>) and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/richwellins"" target=""_blank"">Rich Wellins</a> describes the skills and traits HR needs, how well (or not) the function is prepared (see <em><strong>Figure 9</strong></em> below, which had over 30,000 views when I shared it on LinkedIn before Christmas!) and the relationships in the business that can best help propel HR forward.</p>, <p><em>Figure 9: What HR needs to thrive with Analytics (Source: DDI)</em></p>, <p>One of the more impressive stories I’ve heard on building organisational capability in people analytics comes from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a> and his team at Chevron. This detailed Bersin by Deloitte Case Study* comes in two parts. Part 1 describes how Chevron tackled its challenge to scale, unify and grow analytics capabilities across the organisation, making it an essential skill for all HR professionals and ultimately turn people analytics into a competitive advantage. The key focus was the business rather than HR and steps to achieve this included i) implementing a vision and mission statement to help create an identity, ii) consistently reviewing the metrics tracked for business relevance, and iii) creating a prioritisation mechanism for all analytics projects (see <em><strong>Figure 10</strong></em> below). Building organisational capability centred on two main strategies: i) launching a Community of Practice, which now has 300 members spread across 22 business units and 18 countries, and; ii) introducing a three-stage in-house analytics curriculum that serves to create a structured learning and development program in analytics. Part 2 of the Case Study describes two additional areas of Chevron’s analytics journey: how it built a centre of excellence to optimise its organisational structure and why it believes in leveraging analytics talent across functions. This multi-pronged approach has helped create a vast and virtual people analytics team and effectively changed the way HR and the business thinks. With this firm foundation in place, Chevron is well-positioned to derive the competitive advantage it seeks from its investment in people analytics.

In the first article above from the <a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">MIT Sloan Management Review</a>, the authors describe four lessons from customer analytics than can easily be applied to people analytics. The second article looks specifically at sentiment analysis, which has long been used by organisations to better understand its customers, and is now increasingly being used by forward-thinking organisations to get invaluable insights on their employees. Two examples from Twitter and IBM are highlighted. In the latter, the article describes how IBM used an internally developed sentiment-analysis tool called Social Pulse to engage its employees in a revamp of its performance-review system.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If people analytics is to become a core component of the future HR then it is important that everyone working within the function has a reasonable level of analytical understanding and curiosity. This excellent white paper by Nigel Guenole and Sheri Feinzig, adapted from ‘The Power of People’ book (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">pre-order here</a>) they have written together with Jonathan Ferrar, simplifies the potentially complex subject of research designs and different analytical methods. Confidence (or more to the point, the lack of it) is one of the inhibitors holding many HR professional back from embracing analytics – resources like this white paper are exactly what is needed to accelerate progress. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, Head of Global Workforce Analytics at Experian, testifies in this article, many organisations are still swimming in the slow lane when it comes to workforce analytics. As he goes on to state, it doesn’t have to be a struggle, and this is less likely to be the case if organisations and nascent analytics leaders follow the excellent advice in this article. Effective stakeholder management, building a balanced team and prioritising education and awareness are just three of the tips provided.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst this white paper provides a stark analysis on the current state of people analytics it does provide HR with some helpful home truths, which if the function doesn’t address may lead to many organisations situating people analytics outside HR. The three primary areas of deficiency highlighted by the study are i) most organisations are still only doing basic analyses (see <em><strong>Figure 11</strong></em> below), ii) poor data quality, and, therefore perhaps not unsurprisingly; iii) a lack of confidence by the business in these fledgling people analytics functions. Indeed, more companies said their people analytics team hinders their analytics work than helps it. The silver lining is that these challenges can be tackled and the report goes on to elucidate some of the practical steps that organisations can take to do just that.                                         </p>, <p><em>Figure 11 - The type of people analytics projects being undertaken today (Source: New Talent Management Network)</em></p>, <p>Many organisations decide to build a Centre of Excellence (CoE) as part of its attempt to develop people analytics capability. In this piece, <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/manojkumarhranalytics"" target=""_blank"">Manoj Kumar</a>, who led HSBC’s HR Analytics CoE for five years, outlines five reasons why a CoE may not deliver ROI within expected timelines whilst also suggesting fixes to each of these challenges. I can also highly recommend Manoj’s <a href=""http://talkinghranalytics.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talking HR Analytics</a> blog as an excellent resource for those working or interested in the field.</p>, <p><em>Figure 12: A HR Analytics CoE requires that change is driven by all the stakeholders (Manoj Kumar)</em></p>, <p>Being a mathematician, prolific writer and consultant <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> tables 13 (it’s a prime!) ideas for the budding people analytics aspirant to get started. Together, these cover the whole gamut of people operations from recruiting through to engagement, performance and retention – all with the emphasis on providing business value. There is plenty to inspire here.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As founder and CEO of Talent Analytics, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-roberts-b0217"" target=""_blank"">Greta Roberts</a> has been helping organisations do analytics with their people data for 15 years. Therefore, it is no surprise that she offers some great advice in this article on how to implement predictive workforce analytics and the common pitfalls to avoid. I particularly like Greta’s advice on avoiding the “Wikipedia approach” of starting with the dataset rather than the business question – a typical problem I encounter with organisations trying to get started in this space.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>How do you engage HRBPs and make them “consumers of analytics”? This was the weighty challenge set for the first Human Capital Analytics Group Hackathon held by Copenhagen Business School under the auspices of <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/dana-minbaeva-2818a35"" target=""_blank"">Professor Dana Minbaeva</a>. The solutions are nicely summarised in this article by <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/saskia-menke-788b9ba0/en"" target=""_blank"">Saskia Menke</a>. It is certainly an important challenge for organisations if they are to scale analytics and create a sustainable capability across HR, so the findings make for interesting reading.<strong> </strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>’s Future of Work podcast is always worth a listen and this is certainly the case when it comes to this episode featuring <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a>, CEO of <a href=""http://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a>, a social sensing and analytics platform that uses sensors in employee ID badges to drive team effectiveness and engagement. Waber offers some fascinating observations on the people analytics space, not least his observations to i) start small, but do something that makes you uncomfortable and outside of your comfort zone, ii) if you don’t start people analytics in the next two years it will be hard to catch up with those that have, and iii) on average people analytics increases top line performance by 10-15%.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Another practitioner article comes from <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/sidshishoo"" target=""_blank"">Sidhartha Shishoo</a> of Genpact on the excellent <a href=""http://www.peoplematters.in/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Matters</a> site. The article describes some of the challenges Genpact faced when embarking on its people analytics journey including i) separating analytics from reporting, ii) data quality, iii) building capability and iv) employee privacy.

David R. Green,Top 20 HR Analytics articles: Jan & Feb 2017,2017,Qtr1,Mar,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-20-hr-analytics-articles-jan-feb-2017-david-green/,"[<p>The continued growth in people analytics takes many forms. Whether that’s increased adoption by organisations, the rise in the number of conferences devoted to the subject or the sheer number of articles published on the topic.</p>, <p>This is all wonderful, but it does mean I have had to revisit the number of times per year that I collate, shortlist and publish my favourite selection of articles on people analytics and data driven HR. In 2014 and 2015, it was once per year. Last year, it was twice. This year it seems that bi-monthly is the absolute minimum.</p>, <p>So, here are the articles that stood out for me in January and February 2017:</p>, <p>We start with not one, but two key takeaway summaries from the superb <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; The Future of Work</a> (PAFOW) conference convened and hosted by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> in San Francisco at the beginning of February. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/teuschb/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Teusch</a> captures a selection of the many highlights from a memorable two days and focuses on a number of emerging trends in the space such as creating business impact, optimising the employee experience and the increasing focus companies are placing on understanding and driving team performance. In his round-up, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jpholmes/"" target=""_blank"">Julian Holmes</a> similarly emphasises the need for people analytics projects to have business relevance (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below). Julian also highlights two other trends in the space: i) the increasing role analytics is playing in underpinning organisational design and transformation, and ii) how a number of companies are building people analytics applications in-house such as <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ernestngphd/"" target=""_blank"">Ernest Ng</a> demonstrated he is doing at Salesforce.  </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: Activities that will make workforce analytics more relevant to the business (Source: Julian Holmes)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>From the best people analytics conference in North America (<a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW</a>) to it’s pre-eminent counterpart in Europe – <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tucana’s People Analytics conference series</a>. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcarty/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Carty</a> draws the bulk of his five essentials from the talks given by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmatthewman/"" target=""_blank"">Jim Matthewman</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> at the People Analytics Forum in London in November 2016, coupled with a telling quote from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> that <em>“Analytics is no longer a ‘good idea’ for HR – it is now mandatory”</em>. Look out too for Chakrabarti’s advice on the key role required of HRBPs in making analytics the <em>‘new normal’</em> for HR, as well as Ferrar’s three key principles for communicating the insights from people analytics projects to decision makers in the business (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below). I will be chairing <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a>, which takes place in London on 25-26 April. Check-out the stellar <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/public/PAWorld17_Agenda.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">line up of speakers</a>, and <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/register-people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">register here</a> using the code DG25 for a 25% discount.</p>, <p><em>Jonathan Ferrar delivers the keynote opening speech at Tucana's People Analytics Forum in London, November 2016 (Photo: Tucana)</em></p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Three Principles of Storytelling (Source: The Power of People by Nigel Guenole, Sheri Feinzig &amp; Jonathan Ferrar)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This is a wonderful article. <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a>, one of the pioneers of data driven HR and presently leading the Talent Analytics function at Apple, revisits an article he wrote six years ago that provides guidance to a friend in the early stages of their people analytics journey. The advice offered still rings true today and anyone in the position that Amit’s friend was six years ago would do well to heed the guidance proffered. The company Amit’s friend still works for grew from strength to strength, went public, dominates its market and has steadily increased the size of its highly regarded people analytics team. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Most practitioners tasked with setting up a people analytics practice have to manage with limited budget and resources. In the face of high expectations, how do you succeed? <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-starbuck-ph-d-a48a6823/"" target=""_blank"">Craig Starbuck</a>, HR Reporting &amp; Analytics Manager at Scottrade, shares his experiences of doing exactly this and provides ten guidelines for success. This is a truly engrossing and insightful read and it is hard to choose the best of Craig’s tips, but my favourite three are: Think Pro-Employee, Coalesce Around a Shared Vision and Facilitate and Demonstrate the ROI. Craig and the team at Scottrade won two awards at the <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/DarrenGrantKaplan/hiq-labs-people-analytics-awards-hosted-at-intel"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Elevate Awards</a> in October 2016, and it’s easy to see why when reading this. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzocanlas/"" target=""_blank"">Lorenzo Canlas</a> heads up Talent Analytics at LinkedIn and in his previous article (featured in my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/30-best-hr-analytics-articles-2016-david-green"" target=""_blank"">30 best People Analytics articles of 2016</a>), he revealed that the ROI of his team is forecast to be 10X the cost of the team in 2017. This follow-up article explains one of the secrets to their success, which is founded upon understanding the three project types, the differing outcomes and the needs of their business partners for each type. These three types - inform, insight, or actions &amp; accountability – and their corresponding ‘Conditions of Success’ (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below) are then described together with examples. Yet another insightful article from Lorenzo.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: The three types of people analytics projects and their conditions of success (Source: Lorenzo Canlas)</em></p>, <p>It is rare that a day passes by without me reading at least one article on how artificial intelligence is set to revolutionise HR. It’s certainly true that a number of organisations that have reached a degree of maturity in people analytics are actively exploring how cognitive apps and machine learning can augment what they are already doing. This IBM research digs beneath the hype and provides findings on i) CEO/CHRO views on cognitive computing, ii) employee willingness to receive guidance from cognitive HR solutions, iii) the three areas in which HR is already leveraging cognitive - talent acquisition, talent development and HR operations and iv) recommendations for companies looking to take their first steps. </p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Highlights of IBM Institute for Business Value Cognitive HR Study (Source: IBM)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Deloitte’s <a href=""http://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-en/focus/human-capital-trends.html?id=us:2el:3pr:dup3575:awa:cons:022817:hct17"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Global Human Capital Trends</a> is always a captivating read and the 2017 edition published just last week is no exception. First, Josh Bersin provides an executive summary of the 10 trends featured in the report, with an additional emphasis on what is perhaps the main finding of the study – that AI and robotics are entering the workforce much faster than we may have thought. Bersin's article itself is an absolute must-read. The same goes for the section on people analytics in the actual report itself. The headline finding is that people analytics is “<em>no longer about finding interesting information and flagging it for managers</em>” but is being utilised to “<em>understand every part of a business operation</em>” with analytical tools “<em>being embedded into day-to-day decision making</em>”. A detailed example from Chevron is provided, as are eight factors the authors believe are fundamental to creating a people analytics program. There are a number of invaluable insights in the report not least <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below depicting the old and new rules of people analytics. A must-read. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><em>Figure 5: People Analytics - Old rules vs. New rules (Source: Deloitte University Press)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the most knowledgeable and progressive practitioners I’ve had the pleasure of coming across in the people analytics space is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe/"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a>, who now heads up people analytics at JP Morgan Chase. Ian has previously held leadership roles at Google, Sears and American Express. Hence he has a unique vantage point to describe how different organisations leverage data to understand their people and has a wide array of experiences to draw from when talking about what works and what doesn't. As such, this episode of the superb hiQ Labs podcast is a must-listen as host <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhousman/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Housman</a> and Ian have a fascinating and insightful conversation.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> wrote in his <a href=""http://marketing.bersin.com/predictions-for-2017.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">2017 HR Predictions</a>, we need to rethink organisational design around how work actually gets done in the 21st century. As illustrated in <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below, this means moving from a traditional functional hierarchy to one that enables multi-functional teams to thrive. This is where Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) and its modern day counterpart Social Network Analysis (SNA) comes in. The opportunities this offers HR leaders and people analysts is perfectly described by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> of <a href=""http://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> in this excellent article. Learn how ONA has evolved from a paper based process into a real time continuous flow of data that has transformed the ability of companies to map their informal networks and understand how work really gets done. Newman provides examples of how ONA/SNA can help identify influential employees, support succession planning, identify good/bad leadership behaviours and collaboration. </p>, <p><em>Figure 6: How work gets done (Source: Bersin by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p>One of the most prolific and best writers on people analytics is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a>. I particularly enjoyed this recent article, which analyses a <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/the-need-to-lead-in-data-and-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">recent McKinsey study</a> that found that 86% of executives are still not getting value from analytics. Tracey focuses on the importance of the role of the analytics leader, their position within the organisation (the higher, the better), the need for them to ‘get out into the business’, and the importance of prioritisation and focus. An essential read for any current or aspiring people analytics leader.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing one of the themes picked up by Tracey Smith, this HBR article by <a href=""http://dataqualitysolutions.com/meet-the-data-doc"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Thomas C. Redman</a> makes the case that to be good at their job, a data scientist needs to get out into the business. Only then can they learn how the data is collected, understand the wider context, flesh out the specific problem and present insights in a language that will be understood and therefore implemented by the relevant stakeholders. Redman offers some great examples that whilst falling outside the realm of people analytics can easily be applied to the practice. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> has rapidly emerged as one of the best sources of people analytics articles around. This guest post by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> is a perfect example. Inspired by Daniel Kahneman’s monumental ‘<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0141033576"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Thinking Fast and Slow</a>’ and Rolf Dobelli’s ‘<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Thinking-Clearly-Better-Decisions/dp/1444759566/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1488280116&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+art+of+thinking+clearly+rolf+dobelli"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Art of Thinking Clearly</a>’, Haak summarises 15 cognitive biases that are relevant to the work and results of people analytics projects. As Haak states “<em>there is a benefit for people analytics professionals to learn more about psychology and important cognitive biases, because no one is exempt from these biases</em>”. Check out too <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong> below for <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/busterbenson/"" target=""_blank"">Buster Benson</a>’s <a href=""http://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18#.vzic898hq"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cognitive Bias Sheet</a>, to which Haak refers. </p>, <p><em>Figure 7: Cognitive Bias Codex (Source: John Manoogian III and Buster Benson)</em></p>, <p>As <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> writes in this insightful article, the way we measure employee engagement is changing. From a demand perspective, HR is playing catch-up with its peers in marketing who have adopted Voice of the Customer practices to gain deep insights to inform product and service strategies. Andrew then digs into the technologies that are revolutionising the supply side, which he breaks down into four categories: automation (which as illustrated in <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong> below is enabling a rethink of the end-to-end process), changes to mobile and user interfaces, big data technology (to support people analytics) and machine learning (text analytics and predictive). Andrew is an acknowledged expert in the fields of engagement and people analytics, so this is certainly a recommended read. </p>, <p><em>Figure 8: Rethinking the end-to-end employee feedback process (Source: Andrew Marritt | Workometry, Organization View)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If analytics is to become part of the DNA of HR then it simply has to embraced by HR Business Partners (HRBPs). As <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman/"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a> contends in this excellent guest post on <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a>, the long-term success of your people analytics program depends on it. The challenge is that many HRBPs are notoriously busy and not natural bedfellows for analytics. Creelman offers some invaluable advice on how to enthuse, equip and enable HRBPs and move them to the centre of your analytics equation. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The third entrant from one of <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a>’s guest bloggers is this lengthy but riveting article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/senguptaraja/"" target=""_blank"">Raja Sengupta</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/soumyasanto/"" target=""_blank"">Soumyasanto Sen</a>. The article demystifies a ‘hot topic’ within HR and People Analytics – that of natural language processing (NLP). It describes the relevance of NLP to HR, the key benefits (and applications – see <strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong> below), how it augments rather than automates HR processes and the vendor landscape as well as providing a case study of NLP in the recruiting process. There’s plenty to digest and learn from here. </p>, <p><em>Figure 9: Key application areas of Natural Language Processing in HR (Source: Analytics in HR, Raja Sengupta &amp; Soumyasanto Sen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Articles from <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> have rather dominated this collection, which is testament to the wonderful service <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/nandosteenhuis/"" target=""_blank"">Nando Steenhuis</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen/"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> are providing to the people analytics community. This article by van Vulpen describes the importance of cleaning data and offers a helpful descriptive and visual (see <strong><em>Figure 10</em></strong>) six-step guide in how to actually do it. The checklist is featured in van Vulpen’s book – ‘<a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/ebook-basic-principles-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Basic Principles of People Analytics</a>’, which I heartily recommend to anyone starting out in the people analytics space.</p>, <p><em>Figure 10: Six-Step guide to data cleaning (Source: Analytics in HR | Basic Principles of People Analytics book by Erik van Vulpen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This short but highly apposite article by <a href=""http://linkedin.com:in:anouska-ramsay-7050825"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Anouska Ramsay</a>, UK Talent Director at Capgemini really resonates. We mustn’t forget the ‘people’ element when we are doing people analytics. Whilst analytics can help identify insights that we can then test and implement, we need to remember those people within our businesses that don’t necessarily fit the trend but are also some of our best performers. This is a timely reminder from Anouska and one that highlights the role psychologists can play in interpreting results and as <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> <a href=""http://mortenkamp.com/2014/06/02/how-you-create-a-superhero-analytics-team/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">has written</a> ‘<em>turn information into knowledge</em>’ and mitigate bias and cognitive dissonance. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As interest and adoption of people analytics continues to rise, more and more organisations are looking to hire people who can lead, build and embed this capability within their companies. As <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68/"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> writes in this article, this is no easy task – great people analytics leaders are in short supply and high demand. Hill then offers some helpful advice to recruiters that should help with their search such as who the role should report to (preferably the CHRO) and not to confuse analytics with MI/reporting (a common mistake). </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/beneubanks/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Eubanks</a> is one of my favourite industry analysts. In this article, he draws on research he has undertaken to understand how companies globally are hiring people analytics talent, and outlines three options: build, buy or borrow together with a use case for each one. I’ve seen organisations use one or more of these three options as they build out their people analytics capability. A great article for organisations looking to start, grow or scale their analytics teams.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Last, but certainly not least, <a href=""http://linkedin.com:in:thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> draws on some fascinating research from Stanford highlighting the role music plays in analytics. As Thomas explains, “t<em>he research team showed that music engages the areas of the brain involved with paying attention, making predictions and updating the event in memory</em>”. So, perhaps Thomas has uncovered a previously hitherto unforeseen secret of doing great people analytics. Turn up the volume! </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Hey, it’s my blog so hopefully you can forgive the mild self-promotion, but here are three of the blogs I published in January and February that seemed to have resonated with the people analytics crowd:</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-constitutes-best-practice-people-analytics-david-green"" target=""_blank""><strong>What constitutes best practice in People Analytics?</strong></a><strong> </strong>– I’m fortunate to see at first hand the companies who have successfully adopted people analytics.

Green,The 20 best HR Analytics articles: Jul & Aug 2017,2017,Qtr3,Sep,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-jul-aug-2017-david-green/,"[<p>Summer, at least for those of us in Europe and North America, is entering its twilight and in line with Game of Thrones, winter is coming. Thankfully, the House of HR won’t have to face the Night King, his newly acquired dragon, the White Walkers and the Army of the Dead, although for those HR leaders that wait any longer to adopt analytics you never know!</p>, <p>Like the first six months of 2017, July and August saw a flood of excellent articles on people analytics and selecting the top 20 has once again proven to be a challenging task.</p>, <p>Before I start counting down the articles, I just want to highlight the superb <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; The Future of Work</a> conference, which I will be co-chairing with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> from 20-21 September in Philadelphia. There are still some tickets available, so if you want to hear from some of the best people analytics leaders on the planet such as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe/"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a> (JP Morgan Chase), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a> (McKesson), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a> (Pfizer), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-hawley-3616023/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Hawley</a> (Unilever), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite/"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a> (LinkedIn), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-sparkman-msc-mba-mhr-12710b14/"" target=""_blank"">Ross Sparkman</a> (Facebook), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a> (Capital One) and many others click on the image below to book your space.</p>, <p>On to the top 20 articles for July and August:</p>, <p>Forget Callum McGregor’s ridiculously over-hyped bout with Floyd Mayweather, the real David vs. Goliath contest this summer was hiQ Labs vs. LinkedIn/Microsoft. A brief précis: <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a> is an innovative people analytics technology provider that harnesses LinkedIn public data to help customers predict and subsequently address employee skills gaps and flight risk. As the <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/legal"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">legal page</a> on the hiQ website describes, LinkedIn sent a cease and desist notice to hiQ CEO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/weidick/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Weidick</a> in May. The very survival of the company was at stake, so hiQ decided to fight. The case, which has ramifications way beyond the world of people analytics, really caught the attention and <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/2017_0814_hiq_order.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the ruling</a> went in favour of the underdog. There have been a myriad of articles written since the judge announced he had come down on the side of hiQ – these are a selection. First, attorney <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annemitchell/"" target=""_blank"">Anne P. Mitchell</a> provides a helpful explanation of what the ruling actually means. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/briandfung/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Fung</a>’s article in the Washington Post attempts to explain the motivation of LinkedIn/Microsoft and how they have pledged to fight on. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcharney/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Charney</a> in <a href=""http://recruitingdaily.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Recruiting Daily</a> provides his unique and satirical analysis on what the implications are for the world of recruiting. Finally, you can hear Mark Weideck himself in conversation with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelcheesman/"" target=""_blank"">Joel Cheesman</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadsowash/"" target=""_blank"">Chad Sowash</a> on their podcast. I’ve got no beef with LinkedIn – it’s a great company and I’ve met some fantastic people that work there, but I’m delighted that as things stand hiQ will survive and hopefully thrive. hiQ doesn’t just provide technology to customers they also provide a forum with hiQ Elevate and the <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/podcast/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Podcast</a> to support the people analytics community. Keep up the good work Mark, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal/"" target=""_blank"">Darren Grant Kaplan</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/genevievegraves/"" target=""_blank"">Genevieve Graves</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/darinmedeiros/"" target=""_blank"">Darin Medeiros</a> et al.</p>, <p>This tremendous <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/quarterly/overview"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">McKinsey Quarterly</a> article implores HR to step out of its traditional silo mentality and embrace a new mindset of explicitly using talent to drive value rather than just responding passively to the routine needs of businesses. The authors set out a four-pronged strategy (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) that places people analytics and data driven HR front and centre. The article argues that “<em>companies that take these steps will move toward a next generation of HR that’s data driven, not experience driven; systematic, not ad hoc; and consistent, not hit and miss</em>.” This is a must-read for all CHROs and augers well for the continued growth and influence of analytics in HR.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: The CEO agenda for the 'New HR' (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-may-jun-2017-david-green"" target=""_blank"">Last time</a> I featured <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Power of People</a> by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a>, <a href=""https://www.jaferrar.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferra</a>r and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> and described it as the best book written to date on people analytics. In this article on <a href=""https://www.hrzone.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Zone</a>, Jonathan draws on research from the book to outline the key ingredients required to be a successful people analytics leader. The first is that the role should report to the CHRO not least as it sends a clear message that “<em>the CHRO is putting analytical decision making at the heart of the HR function</em>.” Jonathan then describes how business acumen (comprising financial literacy, political astuteness and awareness of both the internal organisation and the external marketplace) is the most important skill for people analytics leader to have. The organisations that are furthest forward with people analytics have great leaders and those that aspire to emulate these companies would do well to heed the advice Jonathan offers here. You can also hear Jonathan speak at the aforementioned People Analytics &amp; Future of Work conference in Philadelphia on 20-21 September. Find out more <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>One successful people analytics leader who possesses all of the attributes described by Jonathan is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, who leads the team at Microsoft. In this article, Dawn cleverly combines her twin passions of cooking and analytics to share some of the lessons she has learned as a people analytics leader. These include: the need to understand what is important for your business leaders, getting to the ‘why’ rather than stopping at the ‘what’ and the importance of knowing your audience when it comes to presenting insights in a way that will resonate. A perfect recipe! If you want to read more about the people analytics journey at Microsoft, please feel free to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green"" target=""_blank"">read my interview with Dawn</a>.   </p>, <p>Like Dawn, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty-94040a/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> is the epitome of a successful people analytics leader. He has also emerged as one of the foremost writers on the subject and publishes a regular flow of insightful articles on LinkedIn (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty-94040a/detail/recent-activity/posts/"" target=""_blank"">see here</a>). In this article, Keith cites the advances in technology, digital and innovation as the fundamental cause of the increased hype, interest and adoption of people analytics. Keith then describes the opportunities these advances provide when it comes to understanding and analysing people: namely the enrichment of the digital exhaust, new people data to analyse and new ways to analyse people data. </p>, <p>In my interactions with companies and people analytics leaders, I see a lot to be optimistic about the continued growth of people analytics and data driven HR. In this article for <a href=""https://www.hrzone.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Zone</a>, I describe how people analytics is moving from the periphery to the centre of the HR agenda (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>) and cite six trends that are underpinning this transformation. This includes the need to first invest in people analytics before you can do AI in HR, new work models and emerging data sources such as wearables. Analytics is a core component of the future of HR and is absolutely critical if the function is going to provide a positive impact to the business and its employees.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: People Analytics moves from the periphery to the centre of the HR agenda - includes 'Workforce Analytics is the centrepiece of a digital agenda for HR' model by </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs-55173316/"" target=""_blank""><em>Volker Jacobs</em></a><em> | </em><a href=""http://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>TI People</em></a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> has featured in my ‘Best articles…’ series several times. Not only is she one of the leading consultants in the space, her writing is thoughtful, practical and unafraid of offering a different opinion. That is certainly the case with this article, which confronts many of the debates currently raging in the community. Should we regulate HR metrics and force companies to make this data public? Should we develop certifications for HR/People Analysts? Is it HR Analytics or People Analytics? Tracey tackles all of these questions and presents a compelling case for her positioning on all. As she rightly says, instead of wasting our time on trivial arguments, we’d be better focused on improving business and employee outcomes. Read more of Tracey’s Numerical Insights blog <a href=""https://www.numericalinsights.com/news/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>One way to help the continued growth of people analytics is the publication of case studies so that HR professionals can be inspired and learn from the successes others have had and apply these to their own organisations. What makes this example of a fast food restaurant chain so instructive is i) it demonstrates the power of people analytics on frontline staff, ii) the insights derived have led to dramatic improvements in customer satisfaction, service performance, and overall business results, and iii) the analysis busted a number of myths (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>) that had pre-existed within the organisation. Finally, the case study is in-depth, well-written and also demonstrates that one way of accelerating progress in people analytics is to partner with an external party (in this case McKinsey).</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Employee features correlating to the desired outcomes (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p>Many of the organisations I’ve studied with at least some capability in people analytics tend to have focused on just one or two areas of the employee lifecycle – typically recruitment and/or retention. In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marktlawrence/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lawrence</a> explores the opportunity to not only apply analytics across the employee lifecycle (see <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong>) but also to link the insights generated together to gain a more holistic view and have additional impact. This is an excellent article for those getting started with analytics or those seeking to expand their efforts across the employee lifecycle.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The Employee Lifecycle Teardrop (Source: Mark T Lawrence)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Tucana’s People Analytics Podcast, which is expertly hosted by Max Blumberg (and occasionally by me), certainly has a knack of attracting some terrific guests and provoking some stimulating debate. The highlights of season 2 are wittily and succinctly summarised in this article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Spence</a>. As Andrew writes, the guests collectively represent academia (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a>), people analytics practitioners (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanpettman/"" target=""_blank"">Jordan Pettman</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-sparkman-msc-mba-mhr-12710b14/"" target=""_blank"">Ross Sparkman</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-moore-swp/"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Moore</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-thielen-3651402/"" target=""_blank"">Becky Thielen</a>) and consultants (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-collins-8103b02/"" target=""_blank"">Laurence Collins</a>), which provides the listener with a broad view of where the space is today and where it is heading. Speaking of Tucana, I’ll be chairing their <a href=""http://paforum.tucana-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics Forum</a> in London on November 29-30 – <a href=""http://paforum.tucana-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">click here</a> to find out more.</p>, <p>With the digital revolution upon us, companies now seem to be in a state of perpetual transformation, which means that the importance of truly strategic workforce planning is paramount. As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a> write, this represents an excellent opportunity for people analytics leaders and teams to increase their impact on the business. Strategic workforce planning is not just about people now either as technology creates a dynamic reality for organisations (build, buy or bot). The advice and practical examples offered represent an indispensable guide for those seeking to understand how strategic workforce planning continues to evolve and its intrinsic link to people analytics.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> is a superb blog and resource for anyone working or interested in people analytics. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen/"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a>, one of the co-founders, has written a number of excellent articles and this recent piece tackles the subject of employee engagement. The big question Erik seeks to answer is ‘Does Engagement lead to better business performance?’ The advice and suggested methodology offered is a good guide for those seeking to demonstrate the true value of employee engagement and how people analytics can help link this to business performance.</p>, <p>Citing an infamous example from Fox News, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ridwan-ismeer-124763a5/"" target=""_blank"">Ridwan Ismeer</a> writes about the difficulties and inherent risks in building employee performance models (see example in <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below). He then describes six ways to mitigate these risks including not defining performance with a single metric, being cognisant of bias and using reverse causality. An insightful read.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Two alternative views on employee performance (Source: Ridwan Ismeer)</em></p>, <p>We hear a lot about the need to democratise data within organisations and many commentators cite it as a trend that is helping drive growth in people analytics. For the uninitiated (or indeed those trying to convince the uninitiated of the merits of data democratisation) this excellent guide by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> on what data democratisation actually is, the pros and cons and the technology that is helping to propel it is a must-read.</p>, <p>When I talk to people analytics leaders, the subject of organisational network analysis (ONA) is often referenced as an area where projects are either currently underway or being planned. Much of the data being used for ONA comes from email, but as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiparkcoll/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Arkcoll</a> writes used alone email can provide an incomplete picture. Philip illustrates this perfectly in <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong>, which shows six different network relationships from different tools in one organisation. </p>, <p><em>Figure 6 - Diagram showing some of the many networks that exist within different tools in a single organisation (Source: Philip Arkcoll)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing the ONA theme is this pair of excellent articles. First up, on the <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR blog</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardsantoslalleman/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Santos Lalleman</a>, describes how people analytics in tandem with ONA has helped researchers determine the three percent rule (see <strong>Figure 7</strong>). This infers that if you can identify the right 3% (of key influencers) you can reach 85% of other employees. This is a critical imperative for effective change management within an organisation. In the second article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> provides some fascinating insights around the burnout risks to top performers and how organisations can encourage these critical employees to disengage from their networks to recharge and refresh.   </p>, <p><em>Figure 7: The Three Per Cent Rule (Source: Richard Santos Lalleman)</em></p>, <p>The capability to translate people data and insights into compelling stories is paramount to getting stakeholder buy-in and having your recommendations implemented. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/stgmaier/"" target=""_blank"">Steffen Maier</a> provides some tips on how this can be achieved in this article on the <a href=""https://blog.hrn.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRN Blog</a>. Tips include the need to know your audience and adapting your story accordingly, the use of context and presenting actionable solutions and recommendations. Of course, HRN organises HR Tech World, the next instalment of which takes place in Amsterdam on <a href=""http://hrtechcongress.com/amsterdam/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">24 and 25 October</a>. I'll be speaking in and moderating the Smart Data track. IBM and HRN have partnered on research exploring people analytics readiness and, crucially, attitudes towards new and emerging employee data sources. The results of the research will be revealed at HR Tech World. <a href=""http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/3541547/HRN-Survey"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Take the survey here</a> (or click on the image below) for a chance to win some free tickets to the show.</p>, <p><em>Click on the image above to take the survey and a chance to win some free tickets for HR Tech World in Amsterdam in October.</em></p>, <p>Recent research by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> revealed that 65% of companies surveyed are not on track to comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), which comes into effect in May 2018. The legislation, which is all about privacy, has some pretty serious implications for people analytics as it changes the way organisations can collect and process data about employees and job candidates. These three articles provide more information. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/randhindi/"" target=""_blank"">Rand Hindi</a>’s article distils what the legislation actually is and the potential ramifications whilst the other three articles from SHRM, People Management and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jantegze/"" target=""_blank"">Jan Tegze</a> on Recruiting Daily focus on what HR and recruiting needs to do to get their houses in order.</p>, <p>Closely related to the GDPR and the wider importance of employee trust when it comes to people analytics is the adoption of emerging data sources such as wearables and sensors. A couple of recent articles caught my eye on this subject. First, the New York Times reports that Three Square Market, a Wisconsin tech company, has enabled employees that opt in to have a chip the size of a grain of rice injected between their thumb and index finger. Once that is done, any task involving RFID technology — swiping into the office building, paying for food in the cafeteria — can be accomplished with a wave of the hand. The second article in Bloomberg reports that Barclays has installed sensors to check when employees are at their desk. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman/"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a> ponders whether Facebook will one day extend the technology it already has so that organisations can monitor the mood of their employees. Finally, it seems opportune to once again include <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a>'s excellent article on the most important element of people analytics - employee trust, which has been resurrected on the Analytics in HR blog.</p>, <p>As I wrote <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-may-jun-2017-david-green?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_post_details%3BEgsj22r3TxGexjymZksrBg%3D%3D"" target=""_blank"">last time</a>, one of the advantages for HR in being the last major business function to adopt a data driven approach is that there is plenty to learn and be inspired by from outside the function. Three examples are provided here. First, McKinsey research provides nine insights on how business leaders are – and are not adapting – to the analytics revolution. Next, three professors from the Rotman School of Management explain that whilst the predictive capability of AI will supplant human prediction it will also complement human judgement and generate more demand for decision making. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aksweetwood/"" target=""_blank"">Adele Sweetwood</a> describes the mistake many organisations make in of conflating analytics training with data adoption. As Adele explains whilst training is critical, having an adoption plan in place is even more essential. This certainly applies when it comes to creating sustainable capability and a data driven mindset in HR and tallies with the advice offered in the McKinsey study.</p>, <p>One of the characteristics I've seen in companies that do people analytics well is that they have a CHRO who not only sponsors but is involved in people analytics. I saw Leena Nair, CHRO of Unilever, speak recently at the <a href=""http://www.beyondhrforum.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Beyond Global HR Leadership Forum</a> and was hugely impressed. During her speech, Leena emphasised that <em>“we can't say the world around us is changing, but HR will keep doing what we've always done.”</em> Her passion for staying human in a technology obsessed world is the central theme of this captivating podcast with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>. Leena believes that technology, AI and analytics can help us be more human through helping personalise HR services such as learning and recruitment (as Unilever has done) and consequently improve the work experience for employees. It is perhaps no coincidence that Unilever is one of the organisations furthest forward with people analytics (Leena references in the podcast the $100m+ saving Unilever has made as a result of predicting and preventing regretted attrition). The podcast is a great listen and exemplifies that Leena is one of a growing breed of 21st Century CHROs who combine data with intuition and experience to make decisions.

David R. Green,The 20 best HR Analytics articles: Mar & Apr 2017,2017,Qtr2,May,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-mar-apr-2017-david-green/,"[<p>Can it really be May already? 2017 is simply flying past and already this year promises to be a pivotal one for the practice of people analytics. Will this be the year when it becomes absorbed into the wider fabric of HR? Maybe. Maybe not.</p>, <p>Whether it does or whether it doesn’t, one thing is for sure interest levels in data driven people decisions has never been higher. The recent people analytics conferences hosted by Wharton and Tucana in Philadelphia and London respectively were attended by in total close to 1,000 people. The number of articles published on the subject continues to rise and the diversity of subjects describing the challenges people analytics is helping to tackle is stark.</p>, <p>This makes collating the best articles both more enriching and increasingly challenging, but after much deliberation spent listening to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandinista!"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Sandinista!</a> - The Clash's monumental 36 track triple album - here are the 20 articles that stood out in March and April:</p>, <p>Let’s open with one of the most important articles written yet on the subject of people analytics. In many respects the practice of people analytics is going in the right direction – interest levels have soared, adoption is rising and significant sums are being invested in the space by large consultancies, tech giants and start-ups alike. However, as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marktlawrence/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lawrence</a> so passionately argue, continued growth of people analytics is under threat. They cite a potent mix of ill-conceived products, consultants that promise the earth but fail to deliver, uneducated opportunists chasing filthy lucre and naïve consumers who are too easily satisfied by a funky dashboard. Max and Mark’s call for a professional body to outline competencies, define training, provide certification and perhaps most importantly a code of ethics is long overdue. Let’s see if anyone is willing to take up the challenge… </p>, <p>One of the criticisms that can be levied at the majority of people analytics articles is that they are too short and therefore only scratch at the surface of the issue they are attempting to tackle. This certainly doesn't apply to this phenomenally superb series by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty-94040a/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a>, who leads McKinsey’s internal people analytics and assessment capability globally. Throughout the course of three excellently crafted articles (Part 4 - the final episode will follow soon) Keith demystifies machine learning and predictive analytics in HR. In broad terms, Part 1 focuses on preparing your organisation, Part 2 looks at structuring the problem you are trying to solve (""<strong><em>what</em> </strong><em>do you want to model and</em><strong><em> why </em></strong><em>do you want to model it</em>"") whilst Part 3 examines how to prep the data and choose the right algorithm. Do read the articles in sequential order, as there is much to absorb and learn. It is an invaluable contribution to the practice of people analytics. Thank you Keith, I’ll add Part 4 once you publish it!</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a> has already trod the path I predict many heads of people analytics will follow – all the way to the CHRO role as the practice of HR finally becomes more evidence based. This two-part article in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsumser/"" target=""_blank"">John Sumser</a>’s excellent <a href=""http://www.hrexaminer.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Examiner</a> provides the perfect roadmap for success. Part 1 outlines 10 of the key steps (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below) Mark followed, whilst Part 2 looks at each of these steps in more detail. Mark’s passion, knowledge and humour shines throughout what is both a hugely enjoyable and insightful read. See also <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-2-mark-berry-david-green"" target=""_blank"">my interview with Mark Berry</a> for more on his fascinating insights on people analytics, the role of the CHRO and the future of HR.</p>, <p><em>Figure 1: 10 steps to evidence based HR - Mark Berry</em></p>, <p>This HBR article presents the findings of a fascinating four-year study by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebrebele/"" target=""_blank"">Reb Rebele</a> and is an example of the magnitude of impact ambitious people analytics projects can have on both individuals and organisations (as well as being a project that really resonated with me personally). The study examines perhaps the most important people in any organisation – the ‘givers’, how uncontrolled their generosity puts them at risk of burnout and outlines the steps they can adopt so that they don’t wear themselves out. The advice offered (see also <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below) broadly falls into three areas: i) be more proactive and less reactive about how you help, ii) focus on lower cost and higher impact ways of helping, and iii) be more selective rather than helping everyone with everything. For more on this subject, read Grant and Rebele’s follow-up article – <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/02/more-on-being-generous-without-being-a-doormat"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">More on Being Generous Without Being a Doormat</a> and watch this <a href=""https://hbr.org/video/5270475111001/how-and-when-selflessness-at-work-backfires"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">video</a>.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Where are you on the generosity spectrum and 7 habits of highly productive giving - Adam Grant and Reb Rebele</em></p>, <p>This is a first. Previously, I've baulked at including any of my own articles in these ‘best of’ retrospectives, but this entry isn’t about me. It’s about the inspirations, key discussions and stunning work exhibited at two of the holy trinity of conferences dedicated to people analytics – Wharton’s People Analytics Conference and Tucana’s <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> (the other is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a>’s <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; The Future of Work</a>). My summation from the Wharton conference features insights from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieran-snyder-60572987/"" target=""_blank"">Kieran Snyder</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cade-massey-8036282/"" target=""_blank"">Cade Massey</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindav4/"" target=""_blank"">Linda van Leeuwen</a>, whilst my round-up of the Tucana conference (which I also had the good fortune to chair) features the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers/"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a>. It is conferences such as these that help move the practice forward.</p>, <p><em>Click on the image above to read the key takeaways from April's People Analytics World Conference in London</em></p>, <p>Two more articles inspired by the <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> conference. Firstly, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cathrynnewbery/"" target=""_blank"">Cathryn Newbery</a> provides an impeccable summary of the keynotes by Alec Levenson and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhowes/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Howes</a>, which together outlined seven areas where the people analytics profession needs to do better. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcarty/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Carty</a>’s equally excellent article also refers to the Levenson and Howes keynotes but touches too on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/colenussbaumer/"" target=""_blank"">Cole Nussbaumer</a>’s masterclass in storytelling with data before focusing in depth on fascinating insights from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-sparkman-msc-mba-mhr-12710b14/"" target=""_blank"">Ross Sparkman</a> in how Facebook uses analytics to support workforce planning, hiring and succession planning.</p>, <p><em>(L-R) Peter Howes, Ross Sparkman and Alec Levenson speaking at People Analytics World</em></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> also features in my next entry together with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a>, who heads up Talent Intelligence and Analytics at Intel. Two of the sharpest minds in our space surmise (correctly, in my view) that most companies are still struggling to get business insights from their HR data, and also cannot yet focus on advanced analytics and prediction. All is not lost though as they then provide some practical steps to follow, which can be boiled down to choosing the right analysts (combining business acumen with an understanding of people) and then deploying them to work most effectively with both the business and HR. The advice provided on asking the right questions (as opposed to starting with the data) particularly resonates. A must-read.</p>, <p>This report examines the state of analytics across the enterprise but there is much for those involved with people analytics to learn. The first is that we are not alone when it comes to struggling to execute a strategy for what we want to achieve with analytics. A second is that whilst analytics is now a mainstream idea it is still not a mainstream practice - this is particularly true of course for people analytics. The report presents five key findings: i) Competitive advantage with analytics is waning, ii) Optimism about the potential of analytics remains strong, iii) Achieving competitive advantage with analytics requires resolve and a sustained commitment to changing the role of data in decision making, iv) Companies that are successful with analytics are much more likely to have a strategic plan for analytics, and this plan is usually aligned with the organization’s overall corporate strategy, and; v) Most companies are not prepared for the robust investment and cultural change that are required to achieve sustained success with analytics. This report is a must-read.</p>, <p>The premise of this excellent article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> is that, in the information age, people data is rapidly becoming the most valuable source of data in the business. Marr cites the spike in companies investing in technology that can measure and analyse the behaviour and performance of their employees. One example is Deloitte with their <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-capital/topics/improve-employee-experience-management-connectme.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">ConnectMe</a> HR analytics platform, which is focused firmly on the needs of employees. Marr’s discussion with Deloitte principal <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gretczko/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Gretczko</a> about the platform is revealing, and we can expect to a see a flood of companies adopting similar platforms that are “<em>tailored specifically for employees</em>” (we have <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/watson/talent/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">similar platforms at IBM</a>), which like ConnectMe “<em>bring personalised content and experiences based on what employees need</em>”. I concur with Marr’s quote below and believe that it distils the central theme for people analytics moving forward perfectly. For more insight from Bernard Marr, check out <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/2017/04/07/bernard-marr-strategic-enterprise-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this episode of the Tucana People Analytics Podcast</a>, where he speaks to Max Blumberg.</p>, <p><em>Click on the image above to listen to Bernard Marr on the Tucana People Analytics Podcast</em></p>, <p>Initially I was going to select just one or maybe two of these articles, but given they all fall under the category of 'practitioner guidance and/or case studies', I thought readers would want to have easy access to all four. First up is another great <a href=""http://hros.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Open Source</a> case study (do check out what <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsschmidt/"" target=""_blank"">Lars Schmidt</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambrosiavertesi/"" target=""_blank"">Ambrosia Vertesi</a> have created with #HROS if you haven’t already), this time from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cmbrown1/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Brown</a> describing Soundcloud’s people analytics journey. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasherahmadi/"" target=""_blank"">Hasher Ahmadi</a>, who is building KLM’s people analytics capability, provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement analytics on the <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics In HR</a> blog. Next <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keenansteiner/"" target=""_blank"">Keenan Steiner</a> describes the superb use case of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyushmathur/"" target=""_blank"">Piyush Mathur</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougshagam/"" target=""_blank"">Doug Shagam</a> on how they quantified the cost of a single percentage point of attrition to mobilise stakeholders around a strategy to promote lateral moves at Nielsen. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrfredrik/"" target=""_blank"">Fredrik Johnsson</a> of Spotify outlines how using the right data at the right time is absolutely pivotal to making the right hiring decisions.</p>, <p><em>The deck from Nielsen's presentation at Talent Connect upon which the article referenced above is based - Piyush Mathur and Doug Shagam</em></p>, <p>There are more great practitioner stories in my next entry too. The video panel features <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a>, who heads up Talent Analytics globally at Chevron, and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamgaker/"" target=""_blank"">Will Gaker</a> of LinkedIn’s Talent Analytics team in discussion with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patwadors/"" target=""_blank"">Pat Wadors</a> (LinkedIn CHRO) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanbrowne/"" target=""_blank"">Brendan Browne</a> (Global Head of Talent Acquisition, LinkedIn). RJ and Will describe the importance of talent analytics in their companies, whilst the accompanying blog outlines three examples – one each from Chevron and LinkedIn and also an example featuring <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/boryanadineva/"" target=""_blank"">Boryana Dineva</a> on how Tesla used analytics to gain invaluable (and counterintuitive) insights into its employee referral program.</p>, <p><em>WATCH: Will Gaker (left) and RJ Milnor discuss how data and analytics has helped shape the talent strategies at LinkedIn and Chevron</em></p>, <p>A regular inclusion in these ‘best of’ retrospectives, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68/"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> provides a regular supply of great content to organisations and practitioners looking to get started with people analytics or those seeking to build on their initial foundations. This article focuses on Sam’s view (based on his experience and research) that organisations that have invested in a Centre of Expertise have invariably been those that have had more success in building a more credible, agile and sustainable People Analytics proposition. Sam then outlines some of the building blocks involved including: appointing the right leader, determining an appropriate agenda/vision, assembling the right skill-sets (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below) and agreeing success criteria with the business. A hugely insightful read once again from Sam.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Skills required in a People Analytics CoE - Sam Hill</em></p>, <p><em>The next three articles focus on the evolution of employee engagement and its increasing underpinning by analytics...</em></p>, <p>One of the emerging topics in people analytics and potentially one of its most important benefits is how it can underpin efforts to understand, improve and personalise the employee experience. This superb article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a> of <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a> outlines first why investment in people analytics is a pre-requisite and then describes three ways analytics can boost programs in this area: i) segmentation, ii) targeting and prioritising investment as well as iii) understanding and demonstrating value.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>’s new book <a href=""http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111932162X.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘The Employee Experience Advantage’</a> comes highly recommended as this teaser in the Harvard Business Review demonstrates. In the article, Jacob compares organisations that have invested long-term in ‘experience’ to those that have invested short-term in ‘engagement’. The results Jacob presents are highly interesting – both in terms of business metrics but also stock market performance (as illustrated in <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> below). Given that people analytics is crucial to understanding and improving the experience in the three environments outlined by Jacob as most important to employees (cultural, technological and physical), these are highly compelling findings.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Companies that invest in Employee Experience outperform those that don't - Jacob Morgan (The Employee Experience Advantage, Wiley 2017)</em></p>, <p>The third and final entry in this edition on the subject of the evolution of employee engagement and its increasing underpinning by analytics comes from another excellent piece on the Analytics In HR blog. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/senguptaraja/"" target=""_blank"">Raja Sengupta</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumyasanto/"" target=""_blank"">Soumyasanto Sen</a> provide a detailed walk through the hotly debated topic of engagement, demonstrate some of the new thinking in this area (from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>) and suggest a model (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below) on how you can deploy engagement analytics over time.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Deploying Engagement Analytics over a period of time. From proof of concept till establishing analytics in an organisation or culture - Raja Sengupta &amp; Soumyasanto Sen</em></p>, <p>Storytelling is often cited as one of the capabilities many people analytics teams struggle with. Without a compelling story and effective communication you will not be able to turn your hard earned insights into actions. This excellent article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjcook/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Cook</a> distils storytelling with data into four simple and easy to follow steps addressing the plot (what questions are you addressing), the context, understanding your audience and summarising.</p>, <p>Proficiency in storytelling aside, three other perhaps more foundational challenges are often cited by organisations struggling to build capability in people analytics: criticality (where to focus), capability (where to develop the skills of the team) and credibility (how to increase influence and impact). These three areas and the ways to mitigate them are described on the excellent <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside HR blog</a> by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronmcewan/"" target=""_blank"">Aaron McEwan</a> of CEB. This is an invaluable read for those starting out or those struggling to make an impact with people analytics.</p>, <p><em>Finally, I look at three emerging topics in people analytics and highlight the best recent articles on each topic. First up is the re-emergence of Organisational Network Analysis then tackling bias and we ending with ethics, privacy and trust.</em></p>, <p>As adoption of people analytics continues we have also seen in parallel a revitalisation in the interest of Organisational Network Analysis (ONA). Four examples are included here. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> of the pioneering <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> examines how combining ONA with people analytics supports the identification and retention of HiPOs. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Spence</a> looks at how ONA can be used to understand and enhance team dynamics and collaboration. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/saskiamenke/"" target=""_blank"">Saskia Menke</a> takes a broader view on the uses of ONA for people analytics (inc. in M&amp;A) before finally, <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work by Google</a> recounts a specific example from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> of <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a> on the effect networks and day to day employee interactions had on performance across a European bank’s branch network.</p>, <p>Does analytics reduce or magnify unconscious bias? This is another contentious area that is regularly debated at conferences and in the press. This trio of articles highlight with the right science and approach, analytics can significantly mitigate the dangers of unconscious bias. Firstly, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomredman/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas C. Redman</a> offers some great advice on rooting out bias from your decision-making. Then two articles from the FT focus on the specific topic of diversity recruitment and what companies such as KPMG, Vodafone and Microsoft are doing to remove gender bias from the recruitment process. Look out for some telling advice from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/theresamchenry/"" target=""_blank"">Theresa McHenry</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinblackburn/"" target=""_blank"">Martin Blackburn</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/schveninger/"" target=""_blank"">Catalina Schveninger</a> in the first article, and also how Catalina has employed technologies such as <a href=""https://textio.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Textio</a> and <a href=""http://www.headstartapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Headstart</a> at Vodafone to support this initiative. Textio also features in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jane-wild-7898389/"" target=""_blank"">Jane Wild</a>’s piece, which looks at the fascinating subject of how language and imagery can detract or entice female jobseekers – <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieran-snyder-60572987/"" target=""_blank"">Kieran Snyder</a>, CEO of Textio, and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelle-emerson-4a24225/"" target=""_blank"">Joelle Emerson</a> of <a href=""http://www.paradigmiq.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paradigm</a> both feature here. </p>, <p>Finally, we end with the subject that is provoking more debate than anything else when I speak to practitioners and attend conferences: ethics, privacy and employee trust – much of it fuelled by the increasing number of companies looking to gain insights from employee data collected from wearable devices. I’ve included a selection of articles here: Jane Wild’s article in the FT describes some of the quandaries employers are facing and features views and advice from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-collins-8103b02/"" target=""_blank"">Laurence Collins</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Edward Houghton</a> of the CIPD and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-bruce-b84578/"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Bruce</a>. The article also references the EU’s pending GDPR, which is the subject of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghavsingh/"" target=""_blank"">Raghav Singh</a>’s piece. Then there is a well-balanced Newsnight report (see video below) on the growth of wearables, which includes comments from Ben Waber of Humanyze. Next up, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahbutcherjournalist/"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Butcher</a>’s article looks specifically at the use of people analytics in the financial services sector – look out for some sage observations from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> here. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/beneubanks/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Eubanks</a> offers some sound advice to organisations (with some additional comments from yours truly) on the importance of putting employee trust front and centre when it comes to using their data. This debate will only intensify, which seems a nice place to finish this round-up of the best articles!  </p>, <p><em>WATCH: BBC Newsnight report on the growth of wearables in the workplace and the implications for employee trust and privacy</em></p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p><strong><em>David</em></strong><em> is a respected influencer, writer and speaker on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

David R. Green,The 20 best HR Analytics articles: May & Jun 2017,2017,Qtr3,Jul,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-may-jun-2017-david-green/,"[<p>Regular readers may have noted my fondness for music and pop culture analogies. Well, imagine if you could organise a concert of your favourite artists of all time. No longer being on this mortal coil is not a barrier. My selection would include (but not be limited to) the likes of Bowie, The Beatles, The Clash, The Velvet Underground, New Order, Billy Idol (yes, I know - call it a guilty pleasure) and The Stones (both of the Roses and Rolling varieties).</p>, <p>This bi-monthly collection of the best people analytics articles from May and June is in HR terms at least on a similar grand scale. Some of the global giants of HR and analytics are present – Bersin, Boudreau, Cappelli, Ulrich, Briner, Davenport and Cross. People so recognised that they are known by their surnames alone.</p>, <p>The marvellous part about it is that they are all writing about people analytics and its role in helping organisations tackle some of their biggest challenges. With interest levels soaring, the number of conferences on the subject doubling in the last 12 months and adoption levels rising, all indicators seem to be pointing in the right direction. This is despite (as some of the articles included recognise) the road being bumpy and at times treacherous for organisations growing their capabilities.</p>, <p>Collectively, the 20 articles cover pretty much everything in the world of people analytics: case studies, challenges, ethics, employee experience, the future of work, diversity and inclusion etc as well as the best book yet published on the subject (see #1). There are contributions from practitioners, analysts, academics, consultants and some of the most exciting vendors in the space.</p>, <p>On the subject of exciting vendors and before we plunge into the 20 selected articles, I’d like to first highlight the ongoing legal battle between <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a> and LinkedIn (<a href=""http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202792056403/LinkedIn-Spars-With-DataMining-Company-Over-Access-to-Profiles?slreturn=20170602121056"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">see here</a> and <a href=""https://www.courthousenews.com/serious-implications-fight-harvest-linkedin-data/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), which came to my attention over the last two days. hiQ Labs, co-founded by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal/"" target=""_blank"">Darren Grant Kaplan</a>, is one of the most impressive start-ups I’ve come across in the people analytics space and up until now has been using public LinkedIn profiles to help customers i) identify critical employees that are a flight risk, and ii) map the skillset of their workforce. The judgement will be very interesting as it essentially pits privacy rights against the freedom to public information. This one is set to run and run.</p>, <p>Now without further ado, let’s get on with the 20 articles that have made the cut for this edition:</p>, <p>If you already work or are interested in the people analytics field, you must read this book. If you are a HR leader wishing to increase the impact of your people analytics function, you must read this book. If you are a business leader who expects more from HR, you must read this book. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> have written what is for me (and many others I have spoken to) the definitive book on people analytics. The Power of People has in part been informed through interviews the authors conducted with a veritable who’s who of the people analytics field encompassing practitioners, academics, analysts, HR and business executives and consultants.

The ‘Why Aren’t We There Yet?’ question inspired Dana to edit a Special Issue of the Journal of Organizational Effectiveness, People and Performance on Human Capital Analytics. I was humbled to be asked to contribute my ‘The Best Practices to Excel at People Analytics’ article – especially as the other contributors (see list of authors above) represent some of the leading thinkers in the field. All the articles by my fellow contributors warrant inclusion in this list on their own, but it is far more generous to include them all!</p>, <p>One of the most fascinating uses of people analytics is how it is being used together with Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) to uncover insights in areas such as team effectiveness, collaboration and organisational design. A captivating example is provided in the MIT Sloan Management Review, which provides details of a ten-year study led by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> (aka Mr ONA) combining academic research and business to answer the question: <em>How do we best connect employees in ways that more systematically unleash emergent innovation?</em> The findings are illuminating and in brief include highlighting the importance of Adaptive Space (see Figure 2). Other highlights include a compelling case study of the work <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> has led at GM, as well as a description of the three key roles within a network (Brokers, Central Connectors and Energisers). A terrific read with plenty to learn and be inspired by.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: Adaptive Space -</em> <em>the network and organisational context that allows people, ideas, information, and resources to flow across the organisation and spur successful emergent innovation</em> - <em>Source: MIT Sloan Management Review </em> </p>, <p>One must-read study follows another. In this example, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> and the RBL Institute conducted research to assess the impact of competence in HR Analytics on three outcomes: i) personal effectiveness, ii) stakeholder value, and iii) business performance. The results weren’t those that those of us in the people analytics field would have hoped for, with the impact on business performance being fairly modest. Ulrich also notes his surprise at the findings, but offers suggestions on how to transform analytics into a sustainable and value-added HR practice. First, he confirms that analytics do matter and how used effectively can only improve decision-making. Then he recommends the need to i) focus analytics on the right business issues, ii) manage expectations by linking analytics projects to business outcomes, and iii) to build analytics on previous research. It will be fascinating to see how business impact rises as people analytics continues to mature and becomes a core component of HR.</p>, <p>One of the reasons Ulrich cites for the lower than expected impact of people analytics is the failure to focus on the right business challenges. The intrinsic link between people analytics and strategy and the ability this provides to focus on the right projects is the central theme of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a>’s terrific article. Patrick describes the four-year evolution of the people analytics function he leads at ABN AMRO. These cover evolutions in the tools and techniques used, the analytical service offered, the capabilities of the team, where the team sits within the bank (now as part of HR Strategy and Change) and how analytics has become a core component of HR’s DNA. As ever with Patrick’s articles there is plenty to learn from and to be inspired by.</p>, <p>Ethics and trust is arguably the most important part of successful people analytics and is also the biggest challenge facing the majority or practitioners I speak to. With the likes of new legislation (e.g. the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations), emerging data sources (e.g. wearables) and the rush to personalise services to employees this is a fast developing and often confusing part of analytics. These two articles from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-stanka-43260288/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Stanka</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joukovanaggelen/"" target=""_blank"">Jouko van Aggelen</a> (on the excellent <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR blog</a>) provide both the context and sound guidance required by practitioners concerned about this critical subject. I certainly concur with the advice to put employee trust and transparency to the fore.</p>, <p>Ethics was one of the six trends I identified in my recent article for the <a href=""https://blog.hrn.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRN Blog</a>, which focused on organisations that have already successfully built capability in people analytics. The other five trends focused on how organisations are i) seeking to make analytics part of the core organisational DNA, ii) embracing new and emerging data sources, iii) exploring new ways to analyse and democratise data, iv) enabling the future of work and consumerisation of HR, and v) reshaping their organisations. In summary, these organisations see analytics as a core component of HR strategy and critical to improving the impact of the function on the business. I presented these findings at the recent HR Tech World show in San Francisco (see Slideshare below and <a href=""https://blog.hrn.io/unleash-people-5-key-learnings-hr-tech-world-san-francisco/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">key learnings</a> blog). Two of my fellow presenters were...</p>, <p>If <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> earned $1 every time Bersin by Deloitte’s <a href=""http://marketing.bersin.com/rs/bersin/images/hita100113sg.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">2013 High Impact People Analytics Study</a> was quoted in a conference speech, slide or article then he would be a very rich man. The successor to this seminal study will be published later in 2017, and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a> revealed the early findings at the recent HR Tech World show in San Francisco (see Figure 3 and Slideshare below). The research indicates that companies who have built successful people analytics practices recognise the need to i) build data literacy across HR, ii) engage with the right stakeholders in the business and iii) infuse people analytics into business decisions. These findings are significant and augur well for continued and sustainable growth in the space.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: What characteristics predict organisations with high-impact people analytics functions? - The early indicators from Bersin by Deloitte's 2017 study</em></p>, <p>As a bonus, the Slideshare from Josh Bersin’s superb ‘The HR Tech Market Reinvents Itself’ presentation at HR Tech World is also provided below.</p>, <p>Next, I want to introduce you to a terrific initiative outlined in this article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs-55173316/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a>. Whilst I am confident that we will continue to see individually driven advancement in the space, it is collaboration, shared learning and co-creation by people analytics practitioners that will accelerate this process and improve both business impact and employee wellbeing. This program is different from others in that it is being led by Jonathan Ferrar and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> (together with Volker and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkpetersen1/"" target=""_blank"">Dirk Petersen</a>) - who are not only hugely respected by their peers but critically have both been people analytics leaders themselves. Volker’s article outlines the launch meetings taking place in July, which will be hosted by some of the leading lights in the world of people analytics: Patrick Coolen, Alexis Fink, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a>. I’m delighted to have been asked to join these meetings and will watch how the program, which officially launches in September, develops with interest. The space needs initiatives such as these.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Workforce Analytics is the centrepiece of a digital agenda for HR (Source - Volker Jacobs, TI People)</em></p>, <p>Unless your name is Rip van Winkle you can’t fail to have noticed that there is a lot of hype about how AI will transform HR. I believe that in the clamour to be hipper than thou many organisations are trying to put the AI cart before the analytics horse. Without first developing capability in the latter it will be difficult if not impossible to reap the benefits (to businesses and employees) of infusing AI into HR services. This is the premise of the first article in HBR by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-harrison-8b9442/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Harrison</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/deborahow/"" target=""_blank"">Deborah O’Neill</a>, which whilst not specifically focused on HR does emphasise the need for businesses to get the basics right first before plunging head first into sophisticated AI (this definitely applies to HR). Not content with releasing (together with Jonathan Ferrar) the definitive book on people analytics (see #1), Nigel Guenole and Sheri Feinzig (together this time with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrislamb/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Lamb</a>) offer some practical advice on a key building block for AI in HR – the need to audit your organisation’s competency frameworks. The white paper outlines the taxonomies that competencies are comprised (see <em>Figure 5</em> below), why CHROs should either develop and/or audit their existing frameworks, the uses of competencies in AI infused recruitment, career development and learning, and the role of competencies in the future of HR.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: KSAO - The taxonomies that competencies are comprised (Source: IBM Smarter Workforce Institute)</em></p>, <p>In the last round-up of articles from March and April, I featured <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-hr-three-steps-getting-started-keith-mcnulty"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-hr-ins-outs-keith-mcnulty"" target=""_blank"">Part 2</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-hr-intelligent-modelling-keith-mcnulty"" target=""_blank"">Part 3</a> of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty-94040a/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a>’s superb series on machine learning in HR. If you haven’t already, I recommend reading the articles in sequential order. Once you have you’ll be set up nicely for the fourth and final part, To conclude the series, Keith advises first on how to decide if the output of your algorithm is good enough to do something with. Then Keith looks at how to implement it effectively as a predictive tool to support (not replace) human judgement, ensuring that the right processes and procedures are put in place to ensure that potentially damaging aspects of the model are appropriately managed.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> has rapidly become a reliable source of high-quality articles on people analytics and organisational network analysis. In this example, Greg describes how analysing email meta data can help shine a light on a huge problem for many businesses – employee burnout. This is a major contributory cause of attrition and impacts on efforts to build an engaged workforce. As Newman describes, many of the variables required to analyse burnout are visible in our email activity – see four of these in <em>Figure 6</em> below – and as email detail is constantly changing organisations can take the steps necessary to mitigate burnout. Newman’s company <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> are definitely onto something here as this insight would be invaluable for pretty much every company I know.</p>, <p><em>Figure 6: Four variables of employee burnout that can analysed from email meta data (Greg Newman)</em></p>, <p>The vast majority of HR leaders recognise how analytics can support better decision-making, but as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman/"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a> describes in this helpful article on the <a href=""https://www.visier.com/workforce-intelligence-blog/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Visier blog</a>, many are unsure how to do so. Creelman then reels off three mistakes to avoid: i) rebranding the HR Reporting Team by adding the word ‘Analytics’ without providing additional resources, ii) hiring data scientists and asking them to search for insights in the data instead of focusing on the critical business issues, and; iii) overlooking the rest of HR and not taking the steps to improve their data fluency and therefore raise the overall analytical capability within HR. Creelman then provides some good tips on how to avoid falling into these traps.</p>, <p>I always enjoy spending time with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupertmorrison/"" target=""_blank"">Rupert Morrison</a> and his super smart team at <a href=""https://www.orgvue.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">OrgVue</a>. Like me they advocate that people analytics isn’t about providing insights that help HR – instead it should be about improving the organisation. In this terrific article, Rupert offers five mindsets HR should adopt to win hearts and minds within the business. Two suggestions I’d particularly like to highlight are first the need for HR to couple analytics with organisational design to answer the question “how good is my workforce in executing the business strategy?” Secondly, Morrison’s suggestion to gamify and crowdsource the data collection and cleaning process is also quite brilliant. A must-read.</p>, <p>If people analytics is to become a core component of the future HR profession then it is vital that the professional bodies support and enable their members. The CIPD under <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/petercheese/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cheese</a> has taken a lot of steps in this direction and the work of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Edward Houghton</a> has done much to steer things forward. This article presents some of the fruits of his labour: three reports that designed to help practitioners continue to advance and innovate in the field.

Developing a thoughtful approach to how continuous listening and the data it generates can be translated into relevant insights and actions towards improving the employee experience should be a priority. Laura’s article provides five tips on how to achieve this. The one I’d like to highlight is the fifth on ensuring that you apply advanced analytics to the data you collect. This highlights the pivotal role analytics is playing in the evolution of employee engagement – I know of many people analytics functions who have now taken on additional responsibility for survey management, employee listening and expect this trend to continue. </p>, <p>This HBR article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-cappelli-14936a3/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cappelli</a> has provoked some heated debate. The majority seem to have sided with the distinguished professor and concur that HR does not actually have big data. Certainly, few would disagree with Cappelli’s assertion that the challenge for most HR functions is simply to use data at all. However, some would argue that analysing email data, employee sentiment, data from wearable devices and external talent supply and demand data as some organisations are beginning to do does deserve the ‘big’ descriptor. In many respects though this article is one where you need to look past the headline as much of the advice Cappelli offers is both relevant and salient.</p>, <p>Any article that starts with a sports analogy is guaranteed to lure me in and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ridwan-ismeer-124763a5/"" target=""_blank"">Ridwan Ismeer</a>’s recollection of Real Madrid’s ill-fated 2003-04 season was no exception. Even better it’s packed with great insights on people analytics. First, Ridwan provides a pretty sound analysis on the common characteristics of successful people analytics programs. Then he summarises the typical employee attributes used to build models and herein lies the ‘missing’ element in the article’s title. Pretty much all of this data can be classed as human capital data stored in HR systems, but as Ridwan argues what about social capital and the relationship and network data that this is comprised of? He then provides a compelling example from a survey he conducted in an organisation himself – see <em>Figure 7</em> below.</p>, <p><em>Figure 7: Examples of relationship analytics (Ridwan Ismeer)</em></p>, <p>One of the few (only?) advantages of being the last major function in the business to embrace analytics and a evidence-based culture is that there is plenty to learn from and be inspired by from outside HR. Three examples are provided here. First, research from McKinsey focuses on the current and next wave opportunities in digitisation, analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation, their potential impact on employment and work plus advice on what leaders should do. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/toddclarklek/"" target=""_blank"">Todd Clark</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielwiesenfeld/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Wiesenfeld</a> describe three things holding back analytics in business: structure, culture and methodology (sound familiar?). Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenporttom/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Davenport</a> (the man who helped popularise analytics and then people analytics with his and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanne-harris-5b4b6b1/"" target=""_blank"">Jeanne Harris</a>’ seminal <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/Competing-Analytics-New-Science-Winning-x/dp/1422103323"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Competing on Analytics</a> book in 2006 and subsequent <a href=""https://hbr.org/2010/10/competing-on-talent-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Competing on Talent Analytics</a> article for HBR in 2010 – the latter also co-authored with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyashapiro/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Shapiro</a>) examines the progress of analytics in the ensuing ten years, focusing on some of the technological advances that have changed the ways analysts do their work.</p>, <p>As I touched on in the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-mar-apr-2017-david-green"" target=""_blank"">last collection</a>, the question as to whether people analytics reduces or exacerbates bias or supports or hinders diversity initiatives is a contentious issue at many conferences I attend. This quintet of articles provides some contrasting views. The first article centres on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxine-williams-7697485/"" target=""_blank"">Maxine Williams</a>’ (Facebook’s Global Director of Diversity) speech at the recent <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/key-takeaways-from-wharton-people-analytics-conference-david-green"" target=""_blank"">Wharton People Analytics Conference</a>, where she challenged the people analysts present that they needed to do more particularly in the area of race under-representation. The second article (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-briner-8ab7807/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Briner</a> et al) describes how using evidence (and data) can help HR drive change with regards to D&amp;I within their organisations. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hyonschu/"" target=""_blank"">Hyon S Chu</a> describes the main findings of a joint study by <a href=""https://www.cultureamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Culture Amp</a> and <a href=""https://www.paradigmiq.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Paradigm</a> (CEO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelle-emerson-4a24225/"" target=""_blank"">Joelle Emerson</a> also features in the Wharton article too) on D&amp;I specifically in the technology industry. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/frida-polli-03a1855/"" target=""_blank"">Frida Polli</a> of <a href=""https://www.pymetrics.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pymetrics</a> argues that whilst it is impossible to remove bias from humans, it is possible to remove it from algorithms through training, engineering and testing. Al as a powerful force for good – that seemed a good point to conclude the countdown for this time until the Wall Street Journal article appeared on Unilever, one of Pymetrics’ customers, and how they have ditched resumes and traditional campus recruiting in favour of algorithms for some early-career roles.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If you prefer listening rather than reading about people analytics, then I strongly recommend you check out the <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/category/podcast/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tucana People Analytics Podcast</a>, which is usually hosted by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>.

Naturally, these are the topics that CEOs and business leaders really care about. This means that people analytics is now “<em>business critical, mandatory and must be supported well</em>.” Look out for Bersin by Deloitte’s High-Impact People Analytics research, which has been led by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a> and which will be published in the coming weeks. </p>, <p><em>See Josh Bersin's recent presentation of the trends disrupting the HR Technology market and the consequent move to the mainstream of HR for people analytics</em></p>, <p>In this must-watch video, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5/"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a> asserts that research trumps best practice when it comes to making work better for employees. Unfortunately, as Prasad describes, the vast majority of HR programs simply replicate practices from other organisations. Given that each organisation has a different culture and what employees are looking for is also different, is it any surprise that many of these programs fail? Prasad provides examples of the research his people analytics team have conducted (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) to help Googlers make better decisions in areas such as onboarding (by proactively seeking feedback), saving for retirement and diet. These examples all follow the principles of behavioural economics in terms of framing different choices, and all draw on the philosophies habitually used in consumer marketing.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: Examples of people analytics projects at Google (Source: Prasad Setty, re:Work by Google)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Along with Jonathan Ferrar, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> this year published <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Power of People</a> book, which has rapidly become the Bible of people analytics. In this article, Nigel and Sheri adopt a mildly provocative stance and offer five generalisable ‘truths’ (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below) about workforce analytics based on their research and experience. The article has already prompted some lively debate, so it will be interesting to see how this continues to develop.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2: </em></strong><em>5 Truths about Workforce Analytics (Source: Nigel Guenole &amp; Sheri Feinzig, inspired in part by the findings of their</em><strong><em> </em></strong><a href=""http://ibm.biz/HRready"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>HR Analytics Readiness</em></a><em> white paper</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I always enjoy <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a>’s insightful (but alas these days all too infrequent) articles on evidence-based HR. His most recent effort is one of his best. There are two aspects of the article I’d like to highlight. First, as Morten says, <em>“the purpose of evidence-based HR is not to find ‘the Right Answer’ – we are dealing with people after all. The purpose is to use all available evidence (research, internal data, analysis, experience, interviews etc.) to find the solution with the highest probability of adding the most value to your organisation.”</em> This is our best hope of mitigating the bias and prejudice inherent to varying degrees in all of us. Morten then goes on to describe an approach (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>), which emphasises the importance of starting with the business challenge rather than getting lost in the data.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3: </em></strong><em>The HR Value Chain (Source: Morten Kamp Andersen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>My summary of the East Coast edition of the People Analytics &amp; Future of Work (PAFOW) conference features insights from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe/"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetanjali-gamel-17209b68/"" target=""_blank"">Geetanjali Gamel</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite/"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamgaker/"" target=""_blank"">Will Gaker</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbroderickchicago/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Broderick</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-hawley-3616023/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Hawley</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ross-sparkman-msc-mba-mhr-12710b14/"" target=""_blank"">Ross Sparkman</a>. As is typical with PAFOW events, the two days were a vibrant mix of education, inspiration and exploration as speakers, delegates and sponsors sought to share and collaborate to push the envelope on what could be possible with people analytics. The early program for PAFOW San Francisco on 1-2 February 2018 is up <a href=""http://pafow.com/w128/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and with the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-whiteman-ph-d-02a8097/"" target=""_blank"">Heather Whiteman</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-nagy-6b5a73b/"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Nagy</a> already confirmed as speakers it promises to raise the bar even higher. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4: </em></strong><em>Two of the presentations at PAFOW Philadelphia. On the left, Al Adamsen described how people analytics is evolving from a focus on employees to a broader ecosystem of work. Whilst on the right, Geetanjali Gamel spoke about some of the options for career development for people analytics professionals </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> spoke at PAFOW about arguably the most important part of people analytics and certainly one of the biggest challenges facing practitioners – ethics and privacy. This article captures and expands upon the points Jonathan made in Philadelphia including the revelation from a recent study by <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> that 81% of people analytics projects (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>) are jeopardised by ethics and privacy concerns. Jonathan’s advice includes the need for people analytics leaders to work closely with their Chief Privacy Officer, publish a code of conduct, establish a governance council and above all put employee trust and transparency at the centre of what you do.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: 81% of people analytics projects are jeopardised by ethics and privacy concerns (Source: Jonathan Ferrar / Insight222)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnold-birkhoff-570336/"" target=""_blank"">Arnold Birkhoff</a> on the <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> blog builds on the finding from the Insight222 research referenced in the preceding article. Birkhoff argues that this already high figure is set to deteriorate further if companies don’t get their act together in time of the EU’s enhanced privacy legislation –the General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into force in May 2018. Birkhoff then provides perhaps the best explanation I have read yet on GDPR from a HR context and how people analytics leaders can ready themselves and their organisations for this new legislation.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Josh Bersin’s article describes how ONA coupled with people analytics is helping firms to gain insights into what drives productivity, performance and collaboration within their businesses. This next two articles and the three presented at #18 all provide examples of ONA. First up, this piece in HBR by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> et al documents an experiment that investigated whether gender differences in behaviour drive gender differences in outcomes at one multinational organisation. The results, which combined anonymised data from emails and <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a> sociometric badges, indicated that bias rather than differences in behaviour explained the differences in male and female promotion rates. These are not only powerful findings that demonstrate the value of people analytics, but they also highlight the fundamental challenge facing most organisations of the need to reduce bias.  </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> highlights in this fascinating article, the Saratoga Institute advises that the average cost to business of employee turnover is 12% of pre-tax income and that for some firms this figure rises to 40%. So why, when an employee announces their intention to resign, are so many decisions on whether to retain the employee or let them go made on gut and opinion? Newman suggests that prioritising social capital data over traditional static human capital data provides a much better basis for an informed decision. He then goes on to illustrate through network analysis (see examples in <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below) how this can provide insights on the employee’s leadership potential, network size, relationship strength (internal and external) and impact as well as the network disruption that would be caused should s/he leave the organisation. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6: </em></strong><em>Rosalee is central to a large internal network, these are the people that she is influencing, leading, working, collaborating and innovating with (Source: Greg Newman)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As this cover article from HBR states, GE has transformed its business under the tenure of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffimmelt/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Immelt</a> with 50% of its 300,000 employees having been with the company for less than five years. People analytics and algorithms have been central to helping this new talent assimilate and thrive with former head of people analytics and planning <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesgallman/"" target=""_blank"">James Gallman</a> explaining that the matching technology “<em>can take a person and match him or her to something else: online or conventional educational programs, another person, or a job.</em>” The article then goes on to outline how analytics is enabling the employee lifecycle in areas such as career development and succession, training, high potentials, retention, networking and even in supporting cultural change.    </p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>Before we continue with numbers 11-20, a quick interlude. Those who tuned in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-jul-aug-2017-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">last time</a> will have seen that I featured the <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a> vs. LinkedIn legal battle. At the time, the former had just won what we now know was the first battle over its right to use public data from LinkedIn (i.e. the data you and me are happy to be public) within its products that help customers predict and subsequently address employee skills gaps and flight risk.</p>, <p>Naturally I hope that the two parties, both of whom I have the utmost respect for, are able to come to a mutual agreement that suits both. However, it seems that the case will likely run and run all the way to the US Supreme Court.</p>, <p>The case has ramifications that go way beyond the world of people analytics and ultimately will define if public data on the Internet really is ‘public’ and who has the right to use and access it.</p>, <p>Moreover, the very survival of hiQ Labs is at stake as it faces a David vs. Goliath contest and crippling legal costs to continue its fight. As such, hiQ Labs has started a crowdjustice appeal to raise $100,000 towards its legal costs. If you’d like to find out more and/or contribute, please <a href=""https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/hiq/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">click here</a> or on the image below. Whatever happens, I’ll continue covering the story here and how the twists and turns of the legal battle play out.  </p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>This is both an honest and insightful piece by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a>, who has previously published a number of excellent articles in concert with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a>. Here, Alexis describes her realisation that there are four rather than three areas of expertise required for successful analytics projects highlighting ‘influencing’ alongside expertise in content, data and analytics. As Alexis explains as a scientist, this was tough for her to swallow, as good results should speak for themselves! Influencing means working with stakeholders to select the right projects at the outset right through to identifying actions from the insights that are feasible, effective and that will be endorsed. An invaluable read. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This article distils the findings of a master thesis on how to bridge the gap between people analytics and decision-making, which as the authors correctly identify is a significant challenge for many practitioners. The advice offered is centred on the need for more effective collaboration between people analytics teams and HRBPs, which is illustrated below in <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong>. The further commentary offered in the article provides in my view a sensible starting point for organisations seeking to enthuse, equip and enable their HRBPs from an analytics perspective.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7: </em></strong><em>Steps required to bridge the gap between analytics and decision-making (Source: Asbjørn Bloch Jensen &amp; Marco Höpfl)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The second entry on this collection for <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>, who has been somewhat of a prolific writer over the last few months. This article focuses on storytelling – a critical but often scarce skill when it comes to people analytics. Too many projects fail because they are not communicated in a way that resonates with their intended audience. Jonathan emphasises the need to tailor your message depending on the analytics expertise of your audience (see <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong> below), and provides a host of other invaluable tips to improve your storytelling skills.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 8: </em></strong><em>Four essential audience categories for analytics storytelling (Source: The Power of People by Nigel Guenole, Jonathan Ferrar and Sheri Feinzig)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There has been a surge of interest in employee experience as organisations seek to apply the success of their customer experience programs to their workforce. In this piece, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a> describes the three elements she believes are required to understand, track and improve the employee experience. These are i) a continuous listening strategy, ii) cross-functional data sharing, and iii) investing in analytical skills or strategic partnerships, which are all included in <strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong> below.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 9: </em></strong><em>The critical components of an Employee Experience program (Source: iNostix by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst demand from the business for workforce data and analytics is high and CHROs are increasingly supportive of this initiative, HR functions – particularly in Europe – are lagging behind. This was the headline finding of the <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/news/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> / <a href=""https://www-01.ibm.com/software/smarterworkforce/institute/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">IBM Smarter Workforce Institute</a> research I presented recently at HR Tech World in Amsterdam (see <strong><em>Slideshare</em></strong> below). A link to the white paper is provided above, along with articles by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcarty/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Carty</a> and me, which provide commentary on the research findings. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I expect that this article will prove to be very popular as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/senguptaraja/"" target=""_blank"">Raja Sengupta</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunilmeharia/"" target=""_blank"">Sunil Meharia</a> demystify statistics by answering 19 questions typically asked by practitioners just about to embark on their analytics journeys. As the authors opine, without grasping the fundamentals of statistics you cannot capitalise on the huge potential of people analytics. File under mandatory reading, and take a look also at <strong><em>Figure 10</em></strong> below, which the authors use to highlight the risks associated with statistics if not applied properly. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 10: </em></strong><em>A rough guide to spotting bad science (Source: Compound Interest 2015)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing the statistics theme, this entry is definitely one for the technically and statistically minded. The article sees three members of Shell’s rightly revered HR Analytics team (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a/"" target=""_blank"">Esther</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/vgiagkoulas/"" target=""_blank"">Vasileios</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindav4/"" target=""_blank"">Linda</a>) collaborating with academia (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulvanderlaken/"" target=""_blank"">Paul</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/zsuzsa-bakk-4881b05b/"" target=""_blank"">Zsuzsa</a>) to make the case for two statistical methods rarely used in the HR analytics space. The paper explains the virtues of latent bathtub models (see <strong><em>Figure 11</em></strong>), and optimal matching analysis, and it is a fascinating read – even for this untrained eye! </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 11: </em></strong><em>A bathtub model of the mediating effect of employee engagement in the relationship between leadership training and team performance (Source: Wiley)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing the ONA theme from earlier, these three articles describe how the technique is being used by organisations. First, Tushman et al describe how EY is analysing email and calendar data to help clients predict the likelihood of retaining key talent following an acquisition and how they can subsequently develop strategies to maximise retention. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-hariharan-57103097/"" target=""_blank"">Aditya Hariharan</a>’s excellent piece examines how ONA can help organisations identify and mitigate network disruption. Lastly, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiparkcoll/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Arkcoll</a> focuses on how ONA can be used to improve team productivity. These are three superb articles.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 12: </em></strong><em>Diagram comparing time spent on collaboration between team members inside a team with collaboration between the team and other parts of an organization (Source: Philip Arcoll, Worklytics)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There has been an explosion of interest in how wearable technologies and sensors can be used in the workplace with the debate centred on the need to balance ethics/privacy with employee/organisational benefit. The first three articles all touch on the possibilities and perils these technologies offer. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mschrage/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Schrage</a>’s excellent piece focuses on how sensors can be used to measure mental health in the workplace. Next <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geof-wheelwright-3a61928/"" target=""_blank"">Geof Wheelwright</a> reveals how sensory technology from <a href=""http://www.smartcaptech.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">SmartCap Technologies</a> helps detect ‘microsleeps’ in truck drivers and other operators of heavy machinery. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissalang/"" target=""_blank"">Marissa Lang</a>’s article contains an interesting view from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> that more regulation is needed in this burgeoning area. Given some of the examples of technology that Lang’s article exposes, I think he is right. Finally, <a href=""https://twitter.com/TCassauwers"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tom Cassauwers</a> (featuring some sage views from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgivre/"" target=""_blank"">Charles Givre</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabina-leonelli-a878673b/"" target=""_blank"">Sabina Leonelli</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakemetcalf/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Metcalf</a>) ponders whether data science needs its equivalent of the Hippocratic oath.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Finally, some analytics-themed inspiration from outside the HR realm: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesca-gino-b7139436/"" target=""_blank"">Francesca Gino</a> writes on the rise of behavioural economics and its increasing influence on organisations (see earlier example from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5/"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a> on how Google’s people analytics team is applying this). Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/loribieda/"" target=""_blank"">Lori C. Bieda</a> outlines common challenges facing many analytics teams (not just in HR) of i) demand (for analytics) outstripping supply (of analytical talent), ii) organisational immaturity, and iii) the promise of technology vs. the reality of data, and how leaders can navigate the path of disillusionment these challenges can bring. Next the McKinsey article (Richard Kelly et al) outlines seven rules manufacturers should follow with regards to IoT-enabled analytics, much of which has resonance for HR including rule #2 <em>‘capture the right data, not just more data’</em> and rule #4 <em>‘focus on outcomes not technology.’</em> Lastly, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-garton-07b6a1/"" target=""_blank"">Eric Garton</a> argues that our chronic underinvestment in people has led to our systemic problem with productivity. People analytics can help our leaders identify, measure and quantify the optimal areas of investment in human capital, so this seems like a good place to sign off until next time.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If podcasts are your thing then the last two months has seen a flood of excellent people data related gems.

This augurs well for the continued growth of the discipline in 2018 particularly as there is increasing realisation that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/6-reasons-why-people-analytics-central-future-hr-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">analytics is at the centre of the future HR function</a>. The penny seems to have finally dropped with, in the words of Josh Bersin, “<em>CEOs and CHROs now understand that people analytics is a vital part of running a high performing company</em>”.</p>, <p>This issue features some of the most revered names in our space. In addition to the aforementioned Bersin, there are contributions from Dave Ulrich, John Boudreau, Adam Grant, Alec Levenson, Rob Cross, Tom Haak, Bernard Marr, Tracey Smith, Max Blumberg, Jonathan Ferrar and Al Adamsen as well as several articles by practitioners. The subjects covered span the gamut of a people analytics space that is broadening its scope and deepening its impact.</p>, <p>For the eagle-eyed amongst you, yes I know December hasn’t finished yet but rest assured that I’ll pick up any as of yet unpublished gems in the ‘Best of 2017’ article I will ready for January.</p>, <p>It also hasn’t slipped my notice that we are approaching Christmas, so before we get to the 20 articles that feature this time, I wanted to offer a gem of a hors d’oeuvre from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a>. If like me you struggle to come up with gift ideas for some of your nearest and dearest, then <a href=""https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=a63d6b9b98ca61bee8d6e4953&amp;id=89c7abf9bb"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the gift of feedback</a> described in the Wharton professor’s <a href=""http://www.adamgrant.net/newsletter"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Granted</a> newsletter could save your day.   </p>, <p>Without further ado, let’s get on with this issue’s 20 articles:</p>, <p>Not content with having the top article in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-people-analytics-articles-sept-oct-2017-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">the last rundown</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> has stolen the main prize again – this time in concert with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>. If you are even remotely interested in people analytics and you are not a <a href=""https://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin</a> member, you simply must beg, steal or borrow a copy of Madhura’s fabulous report. Its 71 pages are packed full of insights, case studies and advice to improve the impact of your people analytics function. Highlights include the seven top findings for driving high-impact people analytics (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) and also a dramatic update and overhaul of Bersin’s infamous people analytics maturity model (see Josh's article). Josh’s article covers some of the report’s main findings and concludes that people analytics has finally grown up and is now an established function within the business. </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: Top findings from High-Impact people analytics research (Source: Bersin by Deloitte) </em></p>, <p>Like the Bersin report, the second entry from the <a href=""https://www.crforum.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Corporate Research Forum</a> is also a landmark study on the state of workforce/people analytics. Its 68 pages are jam-packed with a critique on the discipline (still too much ‘HR for HR’s sake’) as well as methodologies for connecting analytics with business strategy and strategies for building organisational capability. Whilst the CRF report correctly concludes that the practice still has a long way to go, there is also plenty to learn from and be inspired by. Several case studies are provided that really bring the power of analytics alive. There are contributions from many of the people analytics cognoscenti including <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a>, Esther Bongenaar, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232/"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, Nicky Clement, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/belinda-deery-10793b37/"" target=""_blank"">Belinda Deery</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/timphaynes/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Haynes</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpholmes/"" target=""_blank"">Julian Holmes</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-kelly-2957893/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Kelly</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brydie-lear-4462a12/"" target=""_blank"">Brydie Lear</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/iain-mckendrick-7139171b/"" target=""_blank"">Iain McKendrick</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davemillner/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Millner</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/haig-r-nalbantian-466b034/"" target=""_blank"">Haig Nalbantian</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianokeefe/"" target=""_blank"">Ian O’Keefe</a>.

As <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below depicts and as Al describes, people analytics is moving into its third cycle where value is increasingly being delivered to those that create the data in the first place – employees. I like that Al is at pains to stress that the evolution he outlines is not a progression or maturity model – leading people analytics teams are deploying all three cycles via an ecosystem of data, tools, people, and partners. There’s so much to learn from and be inspired by in this article. Al is one of the true visionaries in our space and I know many people analytics leaders will agree with that sentiment.

It is quite a sobering read on the potential shifts in occupations over the next few years. As <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> below indicates, the worst case scenario sees 800 million workers potentially displaced by 2030. This preview of the report tackles five questions including: what impact automation will have, whether there will be enough jobs in the future and what is the impact of automation on skills and wages. The full report is an absolute treasure trove of information and definitely one to try and wade through over the holiday period. The issues raised will play a large part in the future role of people analytics teams.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: Automation will have a far-reaching effect on the global workforce (Source: McKinsey Global Institute)</em></p>, <p>This is another important article by the ever-reliable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>. In this first instalment of what promises to be a terrific three-part series, Max explains the rationale for using the scientific method in people analytics (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below). He cites examples from R&amp;D and marketing where A/B Testing is routinely used to demonstrate which campaign will deliver the greatest return on investment. So why do so few companies use the scientific method in the HR domain? As Max says it is remarkable, given the habitual use by companies in other business areas and it is undoubtedly one of the factors holding people analytics back. Max also offers some forthright and compelling reasons why HR has been slow to embrace the scientific method. It’s a must read and portends well for the rest of the series.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Proving that a compensation program leads to a desired outcome (Source: Max Blumberg)</em></p>, <p>Does engagement really drive performance? Or is it the other way round? This is a question, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> opines in this article, which can be answered by people analytics. Thomas, who has led people analytics teams at Maersk Drilling, Shell and now National Australia Bank, is not one for the hyperbolic. So when he presents evidence that engagement really does drive both business and individual performance over time (2-3 years), then we should all pay attention. Indeed, Thomas writes that the potential uplift in Sales or Customer Satisfaction (NPS) is typically in the 15-25% range, which as he says is a massive opportunity.</p>, <p>I always enjoy <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>’s musings on analytics and the HR discipline in general. Partly because Mark calls it as he sees it, but also because he invariably uncovers a golden nugget of insight that others have either missed or not explained well enough. This certainly proves to be the case in this superb piece for <a href=""https://www.hrexaminer.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Examiner</a> where Mark explains that the much vaunted mantra that analytics projects should have business relevance is on its own not enough. To relevance, Mark adds the extra ingredient of ‘receptivity’ i.e. business leaders that will actually act on the findings derived from analytics projects. His three tips on how to improve receptivity are both practical and valuable.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> is not only one of the most prolific writers on people analytics, she is also one of the best. Moreover, similar to Mark Berry, Tracey refreshingly does not pull any punches. In this article, Tracey looks at three challenges facing HR Analysts: i) disparate systems producing multiple data sets, ii) the GDPR, and; iii) accessing data sets outside HR. In each case, Tracey calmly distils the challenge before offering wise and practical advice. Above all, as Tracey explains, having the right mindset, developing a thick skin and having a ‘failure is not an option’ approach is critical to thriving in this challenging discipline.  </p>, <p>This pair of articles from two of the most thoughtful and acerbic writers in our space tackle two critical questions relating to people analytics and the use by organisations of employee data. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daviddsouza180/"" target=""_blank"">David D’Souza</a> examines the delicate balancing act that is embracing technology and analytics whilst at the same time being considerate to privacy and data ownership. David deliberately advocates a cautious approach (e.g. “<em>just because it has a mutual benefit - for employee and employer - this still doesn't mean it is right</em>”) and offers some sensible guidance on what could be permissible. In a similar vein, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/garethmjones/"" target=""_blank"">Gareth Jones</a> looks at the thorny issue of data ownership and makes a compelling case that it is owned by the employee and merely shared with the employer. With the new sources of employee data that are increasingly being captured and analysed (e.g. social capital, wearables etc) then Gareth’s call for this data to be shared with employees for their value and benefit is one many of us will agree with.</p>, <p>As collaboration and multi-teaming continues to rise, this is a timely article on how to avoid some of the potential consequent pitfalls such as burnout, lack of cohesion and trust erosion facing employees, teams and leaders if they get this delicate art wrong. The authors, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/profmortensen/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Mortensen</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidi-k-gardner-ab5b825/"" target=""_blank"">Heidi K. Gardner</a> provide a case study of a professional services firm (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below) to highlight the problem. Then they recommend some priorities for team leaders (e.g. map team member skills, foster trust and familiarity, create a learning environment) and organisational leaders (e.g. map and analyse human capital interdependence, promote knowledge flows) to create an environment where multi-teaming thrives.</p>, <p><em>Figure 6: Source 'The Overcommitted Organisation', Harvard Business Review</em></p>, <p>This is an excellent read from the <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> blog by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalgradshtein-starlinks/"" target=""_blank"">Michal Gradshtein</a>, founder at ONA start up <a href=""http://www.starlinkscoming.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">StarLinks</a>, on the role of people analytics in shaping organisational culture and employee experience. Anything that evokes and combines Marty McFly (yes, THAT Marty McFly) and Voltaire, as Michal skilfully does here, is definitely worth a read. Michal likens predictive and prescriptive analytics to a ‘<em>data-driven time machine</em>’ to which we enter the right data and the right questions to predict the future and alter it. This comes with huge responsibilities and also a need for caution just as Doc reminded Marty in Back to the Future of the ripple effect one small intervention could have on the future. Clever, entertaining and hugely insightful – a terrific read. </p>, <p>From Voltaire to Aristotle: in this article for the <a href=""https://www.visier.com/clarity/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Visier blog</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> urges analytics leaders to use the structure and classical elements of storytelling taught by Aristotle when communicating the insights of their projects to the business. Boudreau then uses the classic story of the Three Little Pigs to walk the reader through how to tell a good HR Analytics story with all the elements required: exposition, rising action(s), climax, falling action and resolution. Insightful and fun at the same time with a nice mention for Mark Berry and Jonathan Ferrar too.</p>, <p>For those of you staking your chips on the ‘C’ in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugeneburke/"" target=""_blank"">Eugene Burke</a>’s excellent article on the <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tucana blog</a> being ‘Change' you are wrong. Instead, the ‘C’ in question stands for ‘Culture’. Eugene cites the example of a recent meeting of 100 leading CEOs organised by IBM’s Ginni Rometty, where there was general agreement that “t<em>he biggest problem they face (with regards to innovation) is not technology, but rather creating a culture that can embrace and adapt to technological change</em>.” Eugene then conjures up images of Charles Dickens by regaling a tale of two companies – one recognised for a culture that enables innovation to thrive and one where these elements had historically been misaligned. In the latter a focus on using people analytics to understand and then enable the right behaviours to foster innovation is now starting to pay dividends.</p>, <p>Not one, not two but articles by three of the world’s top people analytics leaders. First up, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a/"" target=""_blank"">Esther Bongenaar</a> outlines the research Shell’s people analytics team have completed in conjunction with Erasmus University on diversity and inclusion. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicky-clement/"" target=""_blank"">Nicky Clement</a> reflects on the people analytics journey at Unilever and the boost achieved through working closely with other analytics teams in the business. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, reflecting on her experience of building the team at Microsoft, focuses on the need to adjust the mix of skills in your team over time to reflect not only where you are on your journey, but also the unique needs of your organisation.</p>, <p>The definitive (if misleadingly titled) account of the <a href=""https://www.hiqlabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">hiQ Labs</a> vs. LinkedIn legal battle, which has grabbed attention throughout 2017. As it stands, hiQ may have won the first battle over its right to use public data from LinkedIn (i.e. the data you and me are happy to be public) within its products that help customers predict and subsequently address employee skills gaps and flight risk. However, as this captivating article from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drakepbennett/"" target=""_blank"">Drake Bennett</a> in Bloomberg Businessweek outlines, LinkedIn has filed an appeal and the saga looks set to continue in 2018 and beyond. Spare a thought for <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal/"" target=""_blank"">Darren Kaplan</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/weidick/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Weidick</a> and the hiQ team as this case is disrupting the growth and upwards trajectory of what is one of the most impressive people analytics start-ups in the burgeoning vendor space. For more on the battle, check out the <a href=""https://www.chadcheese.com/single-post/2017/11/30/Talkin-hiQ-vs-LinkedIn-with-Mark-Weidick-CEO-hiQ---A-Nexxt-Exclusive-Podcast"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Chad &amp; Cheese Podcast</a> of a couple of weeks back with Mark Weidick, CEO of hiQ.</p>, <p>Do you know what a HiPPO is? According to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> it stands for ‘<strong><em>Hi</em></strong>ghest <strong><em>P</em></strong>aid <strong><em>P</em></strong>erson’s <strong><em>O</em></strong>pinion’, and is one of the biggest barriers to more evidence-based and data-driven decision-making in our companies. Sadly, I think this is something particularly contagious and rife within HR and people analytics. In this article, Bernard describes what the HiPPO effect is, why it is so dangerous and most important of all how to tame the HiPPO.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Ed Houghton</a> is one of the unsung heroes driving the people analytics and data-driven HR agenda, which he does under the auspices of the <a href=""https://www.cipd.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CIPD</a>. In the first article, he sets out the why the impact of HR needs to be framed through a risk lens as well as the opportunity lens through which we traditionally view the discipline. Naturally, as Ed goes on to say, this approach needs to be founded on getting measurement right and applying analytics. Ed then nicely links the article to recent research he led for the CIPD together with Warwick Business School and University of Kansas School of Business, which examines the extent to human capital data is used in investment decisions (see video below, which demonstrates the key findings of the research).  </p>, <p>In this piece for Personnel Today, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> examines the role of analytics plays in creating cultures that retain the best people and foster productivity. First, he describes the economic challenges, changing employee expectations and technological advances that are changing the game for HR but also present the function with the opportunity to increase its impact. A major contributor to this is data coupled with people analytics. Jonathan then gives examples of how analytics can empower employees, managers and organisations. For the latter, Jonathan describes how companies are now measuring and analysing the behaviours that underpin corporate culture. Expect to see a significant rise in the use of behavioural analytics in the workplace in 2018.</p>, <p>I’ve featured a number of articles and case studies on Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) in this series throughout 2017. When I speak to people analytics leaders, ONA is the innovation that they are most interested in, so I expect 2018 to see interest in this fascinating area grow. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> is perhaps the world’s leading authority on active ONA. In this article he describes how one company used ONA to promote innovation between two groups of scientists by realising the need to create a culture of ‘adaptive space’. As active ONA comes back into vogue, we are also seeing the emergence of passive ONA, one exponent of this is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> and his company <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a>. In his article, Ben examines the popular cult of productivity and how it is group rather than individual output that companies should be striving for. The example Ben cites of a highly networked internal expert enabling their colleagues to complete their tasks 66% quicker is the perfect example of the value that can be generated through ONA.</p>, <p>There are a plethora of articles predicting what is going to happen in the HR space in 2018 and the vast majority are hocus-pocus, but there are some notable exceptions. The four that particularly resonated with me came from Josh Bersin, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> (see video below) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveweisbeck/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Weisbeck</a>.

First up, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a> interviews <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremywelland/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Welland</a>, Global Head of People Analytics at PayPal, for an engrossing discussion.

David R. Green,Top 10 HR & People Analytics articles of January 2018,2018,Qtr1,Feb,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-10-hr-people-analytics-articles-january-2018-david-green/,"[<p>2018 has certainly started with a bang. I had the pleasure of being co-chair of the best <a href=""http://pafow.com/w128/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work</a> (PAFOW) conference yet last week in San Francisco (write-up to follow next week).</p>, <p>As my co-chair <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> so presciently outlined in his opening to the conference, people analytics has evolved into its <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-30-al-adamsen/"" target=""_blank"">third iteration</a>, whereby value is increasingly being delivered to employees. Subsequent speeches from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremywelland/"" target=""_blank"">Jeremy Welland</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>, Josh Bersin, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlotte-nagy-6b5a73b/"" target=""_blank"">Charlotte Nagy</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianpaolobarozzi/"" target=""_blank"">Gianpaolo Barozzi</a> reinforced this sentiment.</p>, <p>This demonstrates that people analytics is moving in the right direction and with <a href=""https://www.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin by Deloitte</a>’s recent High-Impact People Analytics study finding that 69 per cent of large organisations now have a people analytics team, the growth of the discipline shows no signs of abating.</p>, <p>As the use of people analytics broadens and deepens within organisations so does the amount of literature published on the field. This means that my previous strategy of collecting and curating the best articles on a bi-monthly basis is no longer enough. Henceforth, this series will appear on a monthly basis and not only gather the best articles, but the best podcasts on people analytics too.</p>, <p>So without further ado, here are my favourite 10 articles and 3 podcasts from January on people analytics and its role in both the future of work and the evolution of the HR function:</p>, <p>One of the reasons that interest in and adoption of people analytics is rising is its integral role in digital HR strategy. Indeed, as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> outlines in this excellent piece, analytics is one of the three key priorities of a digital HR strategy: i) actively manage the customer expectation of the function, ii) develop the organisation from jobs to skills based, and iii) provide people analytics insights. As Volker correctly asserts, digital HR is not simply about digitising what HR has done in the past, but is an opportunity to do things differently (and better). Volker’s model (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) illustrates perfectly the enhancements that are needed to innovate and shift the culture of HR. Data and analytics is fundamental to this shift. This is a must-read for any HR or business leader about to or thinking of embarking on a digital HR strategy.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 1</em></strong><em>: Establishing an innovation culture in HR (Source: Volker Jacobs | TI People)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Writing in Raconteur, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> provides compelling evidence on the reasons behind the growth in people analytics. The perfect storm he describes comprises i) increases in the volume and variety of data, ii) the heightened level of insights this provides, iii) the boost in power and scale thanks to the entry of AI into the domain, and iv) a shift in focus from HR to business as companies seek to use analytics to solve operational, risk, sales and performance challenges. As ever with Josh, it is an insightful and illuminating read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The Head of People Analytics is a pivotal role and having the right person leading the team can make the difference between success and failure when it comes to creating and sustaining a data driven culture in HR. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a>, who leads people analytics at Pfizer, is a leader who possesses all of the ingredients required to succeed in this demanding role. In part 1 of our interview series, Arun covers areas such as team capabilities and structure, alignment to the business and how this evolves over time, his tried and tested project methodology (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> below) and insights into key learnings. The advice offered is invaluable and I am grateful to Arun for sharing this with the community. Part 2 will be published w/c 19 February.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 2</em></strong> - <em>Five-Step Research Methodology for People Analytics (Source: Arun Chidambaram)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>People analytics projects have a habit of busting myths and that certainly applies in this HBR article, which details the findings of a case study from the people analytics team at Facebook. The myth that people don’t quit jobs, they quit managers was exposed – at least at Facebook – as not being the case. Indeed, the team found that the opposite was true with people leaving when their job wasn’t enjoyable, their strengths weren’t being used, and they weren’t growing in their careers. The study highlighted the importance of work design and this is where managers have an important role to play in crafting meaningful and motivating roles that employees enjoy. Examples of how this was achieved are then outlined. Facebook has invested significantly in its people analytics capability.

The study found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity were 21% more likely to experience above-average profitability than companies in the bottom quartile. For ethnic and cultural diversity, the likelihood of outperformance was even higher at 33% more likely between top and bottom quartile. The article (and <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/Organization/Our%20Insights/Delivering%20through%20diversity/Delivering-through-Diversity-web-final.ashx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">accompanying report</a>) are a treasure trove of information, and the advice offered (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>) on creating impact through diversity, which includes the use of analytics, is invaluable for HR and business leaders alike. Diversity is a strong area of interest for people analytics teams, and this superb report is an excellent font of knowledge to support this work. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 3</em></strong><em>: </em>Four imperatives for building a successful inclusion and diversity (I&amp;D) strategy<em> (Source: McKinsey)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the most welcome initiatives I read in January comes from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/littal-shemer-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Littal Shemar Haim</a>, who has set herself the challenge of highlighting 365 women worth watching in the HR Tech / People Analytics space.

One to bookmark and come back to on a weekly basis. In a similar vein, the tireless <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hunglee/"" target=""_blank"">Hung Lee</a> has created a list of female conference speakers (see <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VrPfFDZfzMs97Y5NXqphXvRAAkY7vkmn7IPowfcNw_0/edit#gid=0"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) having being inspired by being part of an all-male speaking line-up at a recent conference.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Bersin by Deloitte ran a great series in January comprising 12 blogs outlining their predictions for 2018. All 12 are worth a read – particularly those by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinericksonphd/"" target=""_blank"">Robin Erickson</a> (see <a href=""http://blog.bersin.com/prediction-11-talent-acquisition-will-tap-the-power-of-internal-mobility/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and Josh Bersin (<a href=""http://blog.bersin.com/prediction-1-agile-organization-models-will-start-to-go-mainstream/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://blog.bersin.com/prediction-2-accelerating-digital-transformation-will-force-new-leadership-models/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), but the one that really resonated with me was this one by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>. The article provides more insights from Bersin’s recently published High-Impact People Analytics Study and case studies from the likes of Chevron, Reliance Jio and Merck. As Madhura states, companies need to be careful not to isolate their people analytics team as this will greatly lessen their impact. Instead, companies need to put their teams centre stage to realise the true promise of people analytics – that is its ability to bolster employee engagement and productivity at a day-to-day level—and in doing so, to deliver business results.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> touches on one of the main themes of the aforementioned PAFOW conference I co-chaired in San Francisco last week with Al Adamsen – that people analytics needs to diversify beyond making better HR decisions and solving business issues. Morten’s article outlines a third avenue for people analytics – working in tandem with change management. As Morten describes people analytics can be used in numerous areas such as to identify likely resistance and change agents, analyse employee sentiment and create predictive adoption models.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Of all HR functions, it is perhaps talent acquisition that has most embraced the use of data and analytics. This is borne out in LinkedIn’s excellent Global Recruiting Trends 2018 report. Indeed, along with Diversity, New Interviewing Tools and AI, Data is cited as one of the four trends revolutionising recruiting. Interestingly, the research found that 50% respondents believe that data is very/extremely important, but that only 18% had mostly/completely adopted it within their hiring strategy. The research itself is a highly recommended read and features contributions from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> (Microsoft), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/devinrogozinski/"" target=""_blank"">Devin Rogozinski</a> (Atlassian), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/schveninger/"" target=""_blank"">Catalina Schveninger</a> (Vodafone), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrislouie/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Louis</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dougshagam/"" target=""_blank"">Doug Shagam</a> (Nielsen), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/realworkrealimpact/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Mailey</a> (Intuit) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annaott/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Ott</a>.

In part this is due to Richard Thaler, one of the discipline’s <a href=""https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/9/16447752/richard-thaler-nobel-explained-economics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">pioneers</a>, recently winning the Nobel prize in economics.

Three further articles are included. The first, by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertgraywriterandeditor/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Gray</a>, is a captivating crash-course into the power of the ‘nudge’ and the potential benefit it offers to HR.

The first two focus on the topic of Organisational Network Analysis, which was featured prominently at PAFOW. The discussion between <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> and Al Adamsen is fascinating and illustrates the many potential uses of ONA within companies.

David R. Green,The best HR & People Analytics articles of February 2018,2018,Qtr1,Mar,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-february-2018-david-green/,"[<p>February began in the sun of San Francisco and ended in the snow of the South of England. It’s been a month of contrasts!</p>, <p>As interest in and adoption of people analytics continues to rise and as the discipline continues to broaden and deepen, the range of subjects written on people analytics continues to diversify.</p>, <p>This month’s selection of ten articles and six podcasts covers topics including: new studies on leadership and the future of work, ethics, manager effectiveness, organisational network analysis, the critical role of the analytics translator, wearables and sensors, the role of the people analytics leader and the burgeoning HR technology market amongst many others.</p>, <p>So without further ado, let’s crack on:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar/"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a> kicks off proceedings this month with his analysis of what at first glance appear to be counterintuitive findings from the <a href=""https://www.ddiworld.com/glf2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Global Leadership Forecast 2018</a>. The study, which is authored by DDI, The Conference Board and EY, highlights 25 findings about the state, context, and future of leadership. One of these findings on people analytics highlights a “<em>stunning regression</em>” from the previous study in 2014/15 with success rates dropping for every area of analytics that was compared (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>). Whilst many organisations are undoubtedly still struggling to realise the full potential of people analytics, I'm inclined to agree with Evan's view that this is ""<em>likely a case of the analytics bar rising faster than HR can leap over it</em>"". Evan’s article goes on to describe the other findings highlighted in <em>Figure 1</em> specifically the analytics practices that have the highest impact on bench strength and a financial composite of revenue growth, operating margin, EBITDA, and return on equity, before highlighting the analytics practices that have the highest impact on success.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1: </em></strong><em>A 'Stunning Regression' - comparison of success rates with analytics between the Global Leadership Forecasts 2018 with 2014/15 (Source: DDI, The Conference Board and EY) </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Ethics is arguably the most important element of people analytics and continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing practitioners. This is exacerbated due to technology – and the data it generates – moving in a direction too fast for legislation to keep up with and anticipate, and for employees and organisations to conceive. This research by the IBM Smarter Workforce saw 20,000 workers in 44 countries being surveyed for their perspective on data use in HR analytics. The results showed that within the ‘grey areas’, where legal precedent does not exist, or data ownership is unclear, context and culture matter most. A Case Study describing how IBM implemented its employee listening program Social Pulse is provided along with recommendations for organisations and employees on the use and availability of data. I’ll be presenting some of the findings from the research in the Smart Data breakout at <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/london/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH in London</a> on 20th March.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the first article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> describes a project the people analytics team at Microsoft undertook to answer that age-old question ""<em>What makes a great manager?</em>” The team combined calendar and email data with engagement and other outcome related data in order to understand the behaviours that impact outcomes. The findings helped validate some longstanding hypotheses on what impacts manager effectiveness as well as uncovering some hidden gems too. These included i) the importance of 1:1 time and feedback, ii) manager network strength and size, and; iii) limiting the number of emails sent by managers out of hours. Two of the behaviours highlighted by Dawn: Working after hours and Multitasking in meetings are analysed deeper in the second article by Ryan Fuller et al. <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong> for example illustrates the impact of managers sending emails on a Sunday night.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: The impact of managers sending emails on a Sunday evening (Source: Microsoft Workplace Analytics, HBR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The articles above from Dawn Klinghoffer and Ryan Fuller et al are excellent examples of the use of passive ONA – in this case calendar and email meta data. This article, by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a>, is an example of active ONA – where the data is primarily collected through surveys. The article provides a case study of a company that needed to boost revenue both through sales and the extension of existing business. The ONA project revealed several insights that enabled the organisation to implement a series of initiatives to boost revenue. These included: recognising and rewarding ‘hidden stars’ (i.e. not just those that close the deal), replicating the collaborative behaviour of successful teams (see example in <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>) and creating more space for key revenue producers. As ever with Rob Cross’ work, this is a hugely insightful article.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>: <em>Team B has high client team connectivity with an average of seven relationships per person and was more able to service client needs, whilst Team A has two completely unconnected people and only three relationships per person on average (Source: Rob Cross)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This HBR article outlines the role of the ‘analytics translator’ whose purpose is to ‘bridge the gap’ between the insights identified by the analytics team through to the generation of business outcomes. The authors outline the skills required by translators: domain knowledge, technical fluency, project management skills and an entrepreneurial spirit. They also cite McKinsey research that predicts that by 2026, the surge in demand in the US alone for translators will reach 2-4m. Turning to HR, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers/"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> suggests in this <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-business-partners-should-become-analytics-luk-smeyers-smeyers/"" target=""_blank"">classic article</a>, that the role of the translator in people analytics should be the preserve of HR Business Partners. As people analytics continues to mature, it will be interesting to see if this is what transpires or whether organisations will create a specific role (let’s call it a People Analytics Business Partner) who works alongside the HRBP but has the deeper analytics knowledge required to build a more effective bridge with the business. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a>, Luk’s colleague at iNostix by Deloitte, published a quintet of excellent articles in 2017 and this, her first of 2018, is of a similar high standard. As highlighted in the earlier article by Evan Sinar, many organisations are still struggling to either get their people analytics programs off the ground or, for others that have, build sustainable capability. Laura provides five steps for organisations towards achieving sustainable impact including themes such as mission, priorities, operating model and team (e.g. build/borrow/buy). Laura has helped several organisations build thriving people analytics functions and the summary of her lessons learned (<strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong>) are consistent with what I have seen too.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4: </em></strong><em>5 lessons learned in helping build people analytics functions (Source: Laura Stevens)</em>  </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One lesson that I’d add to Laura Stevens’ list (Figure 4) of ingredients required to building sustainable people analytics capability is that of having <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-constitutes-best-practice-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">an inspirational leader</a>. One such person is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a>, who is Global Head of People Analytics at Pfizer. Arun shared some insights of what is involved in leading a people analytics team in two articles. In Part 2 (see also <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-people-analytics-leader-part-1-building-capability-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Part 1</a>), Arun outlines the intra- and inter-responsibilities of the people analytics leader (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>), as well as sharing his experience on how to develop an analytical culture. In the second half of the article, Arun shares his thoughts on what lies ahead for the people analytics field and also provides several pearls of wisdom on the subject of ethics and privacy. Analytics in HR kindly made Arun's and my article their #1 <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/blog/trending-hr-analytics-articles-february-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Top Trending HR Analytics Article of February</a>, so thank you very much.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5: </em></strong><em>The Intra- and Inter- responsibilities of the Head of People Analytics (Source: Arun Chidambaram)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The third article this month written by a Head of People Analytics (along with Dawn and Arun). <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhartmann/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Hartmann</a> makes a compelling case that too many people analytics teams are spending time and effort on reproducing (often with inferior results) what we already know from existing research. Peter explains that this is invariably caused by ‘<em>not invented here syndrome</em>’, where stakeholders may too often dismiss the notion that proven external research applies to their company. As Peter then goes on to suggest, citing a sublime article by Thomas Rasmussen and Dave Ulrich (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090261615000443"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Learning from practice: how HR analytics avoids being a management fad</a>), a balance should be struck between combining external research with company specific variables as this will not only aid the speed of the work, but also the quality and validity of the insights.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This illuminating report by Bain outlines how demographics, automation and inequality have the potential to dramatically reshape our world in the 2020s and beyond. As <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> shows, the headline finding is that the collision of these three forces could trigger economic disruption far greater than we have experienced over the past 60 years. The more advanced People Analytics teams are already helping their organisations prepare a path through this minefield, in terms of helping with restructuring, workforce mix and organisational design. The report examines six core areas: i) the impact of aging populations and the end of plentiful labour, ii) how automation on the one hand will increase productivity but on the other eliminate jobs and suppress wages, iii) how rising inequality could affect growth, iv) how development will unfold in the ‘turbulent’ 2020s, v) considers the outlook if governments intervene more actively in the marketplace to address economic imbalances, and; vi) focuses on the practical business implications of these trends for leadership teams. It’s a long, but worthwhile read. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6: </em></strong><em>The collision of demographics, automation and inequality is likely to create decades of disruption (Source: Bain Macro Trends Group Analysis) </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This peak into the future describes how emotion-sensing technologies (EST) can potentially help employees make better decisions, improve concentration, and adopt healthier and more productive work styles. Examples of technologies that will help identify boredom, heightened stress levels and burnout are provided. Naturally, one of the big barriers to implementation (see <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong>) are concerns related to privacy. The article describes the need for education and transparency, as well as clear governance but also interestingly recommends that employees should have sole control and ownership of their data. This debate on who ‘owns’ employee data is one I expect to grow in the coming years as EST become more commonplace.  </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7: </em></strong><em>Implementation Barriers for Emotion-Sensing Technologies - Multiple measures are available to appraise stress, attention, and decision-making.

David R. Green,The best HR & People Analytics articles of March 2018,2018,Qtr2,Apr,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-march-2018-david-green/,"[<p>The blanket news coverage and general opprobrium following the expose of the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cambridge Analytica/Facebook data breach</a> was a good reminder that ethics and data privacy is arguably the most important part of any analytics program – particularly when it comes to HR and employee data.</p>, <p>With perfect (but albeit fortunate) timing, the role of ethics in people analytics was the subject of my presentation at <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/news/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> in London little more than three days after the full extent of Cambridge Analytica’s practices were exposed. My article <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dont-forget-h-hr-ethics-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Don’t Forget the ‘H’ in HR</a>, which highlights research and case studies in this area before outlining recommendations for people analytics teams is hopefully a helpful addition to resources about ethics and people data. Certainly, Tracey Smith’s article <a href=""https://www.numericalinsights.com/news/2018/3/18/5-ways-to-better-protect-your-confidential-data"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">5 Ways to Better Protect Your Confidential Data</a> is well worth a read. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: Don't Forget the 'H' in HR - read article </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dont-forget-h-hr-ethics-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><em>here</em></a><em> </em></p>, <p>From UNLEASH in London, I flew to the US to attend the <a href=""https://wpa.wharton.upenn.edu/conference/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Wharton People Analytics Conference</a> where ethics featured prominently in the program perhaps most notably in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpatil/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Patil</a>’s and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesduhigg/"" target=""_blank"">Charles Duhigg</a>’s fascinating keynote discussion – more on this in the next few weeks.</p>, <p>Turning to this month’s choice of articles…</p>, <p>Kicking off this month’s selection is a powerful interview in Stanford Business with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-pfeffer-57a01b6/"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Pfeffer</a> about his new book ‘<a href=""https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/books/dying-paycheck"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dying for a Paycheck</a>’, which provides a damning indictment on how the workplace is literally killing people. Not only do modern management practices engender stress, damage engagement and destroy the mental and physical health of employees, Pfeffer also emphasises the massive harm it causes company performance too. This is why the field of people analytics is so important as done well it can shine a light on the damage the practices outlined by Pfeffer cause organisational performance, team dynamics and individual well-being. One can only hope that business leaders around the world read Pfeffer’s book, heed his warnings, say enough is enough and reverse the damage they are causing.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I always enjoy debating the progress (or otherwise) of people analytics with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> and reading his thought provoking articles on the subject. His latest opus in HR Zone is no exception. In it Max argues that people analytics needs to step up its game if it is going to fulfil its promise, solve real business problems and help avert the damage companies are inflicting on their employees as referenced in Jeffrey Pfeffer’s aforementioned book. Max outlines a curriculum designed to improve the understanding by HR as a whole of analytics. This is the only way, Max argues, that people analytics teams can progress from projects centred on operational activities such as retention and recruitment to ones that have real impact with business leaders (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>: Linking HR and Senior General manager (SGM) perspectives: Value Profiling (Source: Max Blumberg, HR Zone)</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If you want to read thought provoking articles about people analytics, HR technology and employee engagement then you don’t need to look much further than <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a>, whose insightful commentary I have enjoyed for several years. Andrew has published a glut of excellent articles already in 2018 and this one on taking a systematic approach to selecting a suitable analytics project is no exception. Andrew outlines a number of techniques, including the ‘5 Whys’ to help uncover the real business problem. He also emphasises the need to consider at an early stage how you intend to realise value from the analysis, provides tips on developing and testing hypotheses, examines methods of collecting new data and critically how to measure success. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Touching on similar ground to Andrew Marritt, this is an excellent interview with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a>, one of the foremost practitioners in our space. Having led the people analytics teams at Maersk and Shell, Thomas is now pulling up trees at National Australia Bank. This interview draws on <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090261615000443"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the seminal paper</a>, Thomas co-authored with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> in 2015 as well as his work at NAB. Thomas shares a wealth of excellent pointers in here not least around asking the importance of asking the right questions and focusing on the business problem you are trying to solve rather than the data.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>From one respected people analytic leader to another. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetanjali-gamel-17209b68/"" target=""_blank"">Geetanjali Gamel</a>’s presentation was one of the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analytics-people-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">highlights</a> of the People Analytics &amp; Future of Work conference I co-chaired in San Francisco earlier this year. Geetanjali leads the team at Merck &amp; Co and this article on <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work</a> outlines some of the work her team has done in the employee engagement space. Two interesting takeaways here is how Geetanjali and her team use research to influence decision making, and also how they communicate the insights from their work to engender employee trust.</p>, <p>The Kinks once warned of the dangers of being a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-JKWDC6fDs"" target=""_blank"">dedicated follower of fashion</a>, and this excellent collaboration between <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottjuddpublic/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Judd</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-o-rourke-ph-d-7b304238/"" target=""_blank"">Eric O’Rourke</a> of Facebook’s people analytics team and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> suggests that the days of the humble employee survey may not be over yet. The team found that at Facebook surveys are still great predictors of behaviour, provide employees with the chance to be heard and are a great vehicle for changing behaviours.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.cultureamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Culture Amp</a>’s Chief Scientist, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-mcpherson-0497209/"" target=""_blank"">Jason McPherson</a> was not just content with publishing one outstanding article this month, he produced two (do check out <a href=""https://blog.cultureamp.com/whats-driving-employee-retention"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">What matters most when it comes to driving employee retention?</a> too). Jason’s second effort examines the relationship between Glassdoor data and Culture Amp’s annual benchmark data it creates from the aggregate engagement the company collects from its thousands of customers. The results are fascinating (see example in <strong><em>Figure X</em></strong>) and as Jason writes point to some important trends, like the ability to use internal employee engagement data to predict how your company is perceived externally.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3: </em></strong><em>The relationship between engagement and Glassdoor ratings (Source: Jason McPherson, Culture Amp)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>March's HBR has a triumvirate of terrific articles on how tech is transforming HR under the banner of the new rules of talent management. The lead article from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-cappelli-14936a3/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cappelli</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annatavis/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Tavis</a> describes how the HR function is ""finally getting its long awaited overhaul"". Then an interview with CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-gherson-1b93b77/"" target=""_blank"">Diane Gherson</a> outlines how IBM has radically co-created the employee experience through a lens of the employee as customer. The third article from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicsbarton/"" target=""_blank"">Dominic Barton</a>, Dennis Carey and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rcharan/"" target=""_blank"">Ram Charan</a> provides another case study, this time from ING, and describes how agile methodologies were used to design a team-based approach to deploying, developing, and assessing talent.</p>, <p>In Bersin by Deloitte’s High-Impact People Analytics <a href=""http://marketing.bersin.com/rs/976-LMP-699/images/Infographic-HIPAN-TopFindings.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">study</a>, which was published last November, one of the headline findings was that 69% of large organisations now have a people analytics team. The study, which was written by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, also highlighted that organisations can only realise the full potential of people analytics when data-driven decision-making is embedded in the culture. As such, this article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenporttom/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Davenport</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/randy-bean-6903882/"" target=""_blank"">Randy Bean</a> is timely as it reveals only one-third of companies have succeeded in shifting to a data-driven culture. It is reassuring and perhaps scary at the same time to see that other functions in the business find it just as challenging as HR does to create the data-driven culture required for analytics to thrive.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Organisational Network Analysis is an area of people analytics that is increasingly providing a lot of coverage, and is one of the techniques people analytics leaders are most interested in finding out more about. This pair of articles helps shed more light. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chlo%C3%A9-meredith/"" target=""_blank"">Chloé Meredith</a> answers five frequently asked questions about ONA such as common use cases, how to ensure privacy and key learnings from previous projects. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> describe in Visier’s <a href=""https://www.visier.com/clarity/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Clarity Magazine</a> how ONA can be applied to identify key influencers, connectors and hidden stars within an organisation, bolster succession planning, highlight employees at risk of burnout and support diversity and inclusion programs.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Once again there was a great selection of podcasts on data-driven HR to tune into in March. If you haven’t already subscribed to Adam Grant’s <a href=""https://www.ted.com/read/ted-podcasts/worklife"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">WorkLife</a> podcast then you are really missing out as evidenced by this fascinating episode on the secrets of building a winning team. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattalder/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Alder</a> talks to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-agnew-7006621a/"" target=""_blank"">Alan Agnew</a> about how Philips is using talent intelligence to bolster its recruiting strategy. Next I had the pleasure of speaking to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> about his forthcoming book <a href=""https://www.koganpage.com/product/data-driven-hr-9780749482466"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Data-Driven HR</a> (which will be launched at <a href=""http://paworld18.tucana-global.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> on 11th April) and how analytics and technology is set to change the face of HR. Finally, if you want to learn more about ONA then you’ll enjoy <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a>’s discussion with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiparkcoll/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Arkcoll</a>, Founder and CEO of the excellent <a href=""https://www.worklytics.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Worklytics</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>March was another busy month for me culminating in an eventful week that saw me deliver two presentations and moderating the Smart Data track at UNLEASH in London, before flying (a day late thanks to a snowstorm on the East Coast) to the Wharton People Analytics Conference in Philadelphia. As such, I’d like to say a quick thank you to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marccoleman/"" target=""_blank"">Marc Coleman</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/leah-narodetsky-1299a095/"" target=""_blank"">Leah Narodetsky</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annaott/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Ott</a> of UNLEASH and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-zarrow/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Zarrow</a> at Wharton for inviting me to your events.</p>, <p>I’d also like to thank <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen/"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> and <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics In HR</a> for publishing this <a href=""https://www.analyticsinhr.com/blog/video-full-interview-david-green/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">video</a> interview we recorded at UNLEASH (when it was still known as HR Tech World) in Amsterdam last October. Thanks also to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesdballard/"" target=""_blank"">James Ballard</a> and the Business Transformation Network for working with me on this <a href=""https://www.thebtn.tv/exclusive-content/article/what-can-organisations-do-overcome-resistance-people-analytics-david-green"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, which previews the People Analytics World conference I’ll be chairing in London next week and looks at some of the obstacles facing organisations in this field.</p>, <p>Finally, March was a milestone month as it marked <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6387314928411385856/"" target=""_blank"">the end of my time with IBM</a> after just over two productive and happy years.

David R. Green,The best HR & People Analytics articles of April 2018,2018,Qtr2,May,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-april-2018-david-green/,"[<p>April was a momentous month both personally for me and also, I believe for the field of people analytics too.</p>, <p>From a personal perspective, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-im-leaving-ibm-my-next-move-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">I left IBM</a> to go out on my own, launched my new <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">website</a> and <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> (where the next monthly collection of articles will be published - please feel free to <a href=""https://www.davidrgreen.com/newsletter/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">subscribe here</a>) as well as gladly accepted board advisor roles with Insight222 (see <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-reasons-ive-joined-insight222-board-advisor-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and TrustSphere (<a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/leading-people-analytics-practitioner-future-of-work-visionary-david-green-joins-trustspheres-advisory-board/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p>, <p>I feel fortunate that these exciting personal developments appear to be timed in parallel with real signs that the field of people analytics is maturing and undergoing rapid growth. Deloitte’s <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">2018 Global Human Capital Trends</a> survey was published at the beginning of the month and reported that 85 percent of respondents (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below) viewed people analytics as important or very important, making it the joint first ranked trend in terms of importance (a surge from being ranked eighth in 2017).</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>: <em>The top 10 trends highlighted in Deloitte's 2018 Global Human Capital Trends report by importance and readiness (Source: Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends, 2018)</em></p>, <p>This sea change in the level of importance attributed to people analytics was also obvious at the <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> conference, I chaired in London in April. As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> writes in one of the articles below, the focus of the presentations at the conference were centred on the business (and employee) value of people analytics. This shift is a sign that the field is maturing and importantly gaining in confidence as it is only through quantifying business value that the discipline will continue to thrive, gain investment and become a core component not just of HR but of executive decision making.</p>, <p>The progress of the field and its increasing importance to organisations and the future of HR is also reflected in the articles, podcasts and videos I have selected this month, which kicks off deservedly with:</p>, <p>As usual Deloitte’s aforementioned Global Human Capital Trends report is well worth all the hype and anticipation associated with it. The headline finding in the 2018 report is the rapid rise of the social enterprise, which the report defines as reflecting the “<em>growing importance of social capital in shaping an organisation’s purpose, guiding its relationships with stakeholders, and in influencing its ultimate success or failure</em>”. The entire 102 page report is an absorbing read, but the people analytics chapter is particularly fascinating. Titled ‘<em>People data: How far is too far’</em>, the authors describe the rapid growth of the field, the increase in the number and type of data sources being used, and the consequent risk this poses to privacy and data security. The article highlights a potential blind spot (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>), where whilst organisations are actively managing the risks of using people data around employee perceptions and legal liability, only a quarter are managing the potential impact on their consumer brand. Ethics is arguably the most important part of people analytics and the biggest risk to its progress - the findings in the report only go to reinforce this.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 2</em></strong><em>: When it comes to using people data, organisations are actively managing risks around employee perceptions and legal liability, but only a quarter are managing the potential impact on their consumer brand (Source: Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Writing in Talent Economy, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> underlines the unprecedented change work is undergoing, and the extent to which this will revolutionise the capabilities HR needs to consequently develop in the coming years. Keith describes the evolution of HR, from 1.0 (predominantly focused on administration and industrial relations) to 2.0 (business partner, use of data restricted to reporting), and then argues that HR now needs to shift to 3.0. This third version of HR, as Keith explains, requires a more strategic focus in three ways: i) people analytics will be at HR’s core, ii) the HR function will be more agile and efficient, and iii) HR professionals will need to have better business acumen and possess problem-solving skills. An insightful and inspiring article, and one to read alongside <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a>’s reappraisal of his infamous business partner model. As Ulrich explains he has written numerous books and delivered countless talks since 1997 (when the original model was published) on how HR is not about HR but about delivering value to multiple stakeholders. This puts the ridiculous criticism of his original model into the right context as Ulrich can hardly be blamed for the inability of organisations to evolve a model he first published over 20 years ago. The article provides a table of 13 pivots in the 2.0 model including <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>, which summarises the requirements when it comes to analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 3 </em></strong><em>– Extract from 13 pivots required in the HR Business Partner 2.0 model - HR Analytics (Source: Dave Ulrich) </em><strong><em>  </em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> is the most prolific and arguably best commentator around on how technology, analytics and data will impact the future of work and our everyday lives. Bernard launched his new book <a href=""https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=1297"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">‘Data-Driven HR’</a> at People Analytics World and has been serialising some of the content in his Forbes column. Two examples are provided here. First, Bernard outlines why data is probably the greatest asset HR has, whilst the second article describes three ways HR teams can use data, to: i) make better business decisions, ii) better understand employees and iii) improve HR operations. The articles are an excellent taster for the book, which I highly recommend anyone interested in increasing the impact of HR in their organisation should read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The first of two entries this month by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> was inspired by the Tucana <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> conference I had the pleasure of chairing in London on 11/12 April. As someone who attended the first People Analytics World in 2014, Andrew is ideally positioned to describe how the conversation has shifted from whether companies should even do people analytics in 2014 to the dominant discussion this year on deriving business value. Andrew then describes two cases presented at the show by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelctocci/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Tocci</a> (P&amp;G) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/swati-chawla-8b10445/"" target=""_blank"">Swati Chawla</a> (Syngenta), which whilst not the most sophisticated or complex solutions provided real and quantifiable business value. Andrew’s article was just one of many inspired by People Analytics World including others penned by Michael Carty (<a href=""https://www.xperthr.com/people-analytics/2018/04/17/paworld18-people-analytics-to-drive-employee-engagement-and-retention/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), Caroline Styr (<a href=""http://www.futureofwork.com/article/people-analytics-beyond-hr"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and Littal Shemar Haim (<a href=""http://www.littalshemerhaim.com/key-takeaways-from-people-analytics-world-london-2018-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It’s terrific that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers/"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> is writing again, not only because he is one of the most knowledgeable people in our space but because the <a href=""https://www.inostix.com/blog/en/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix blog</a> is an absolute treasure trove of articles on people analytics stretching all the way back to 2011. In this article, Luk issues a rallying cry that people analytics teams need to break out of the ‘dark room of HR’ and seek cross-functional learning and collaboration opportunities. This, Luk contests, will help raise the profile, impact and influence of people analytics to the business. He then outlines five lessons HR can learn from marketing about the use of data and analytics and how these can be used to inform decisions. Welcome back Luk, and happy fifth anniversary too to you and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> on five years of iNostix and ABN AMRO working together!</p>, <p><em>Patrick Coolen and Luk Smeyers pictured at People Analytics World to mark the fifth anniversary of the partnership between ABN AMRO and iNostix</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst Luk has been on his writing sabbatical, his iNostix colleague <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a> has taken up the mantle and written a series of superb articles centred on the role of people analytics in designing, measuring and deriving benefit from employee experience. This article, which provides four guiding principles to a successful continuous listening program – see the ‘4 C’s of Continuous Listening’ model in <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong> below - may well be her best yet. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 4: </em></strong><em>The 4 C's of Continuous Listening (Source: Laura Stevens, iNostix by Deloitte)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I featured two of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-mcpherson-0497209/"" target=""_blank"">Jason McPherson</a>’s articles last month, and <a href=""https://www.cultureamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Culture Amp</a>’s Chief Scientist gets his hat-trick in this excellent guide on how to link data from people surveys to broader business outcomes. Linking employee feedback to business outcomes can be complex, so Jason’s advice “<em>to be realistic and understand that some things are potentially outside the sphere of what you can measure or model</em>” should be noted. Jason then offers some tips on how to get started with linkage, which includes his recommendation to start small with something where you have confidence that there is a connection and where you have a reasonable level of control over the inputs. Watch the video below and then read Jason’s article.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Next, two articles on ONA. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/suvarna-joshi-4823456b/"" target=""_blank"">Suvarna Joshi</a> describes four examples of how passive ONA can provide fresh sets of data to help organisations measure the impact of diversity and inclusion. These include i) Understanding gender differences in networking behaviour, ii) Measuring inclusion of diverse groups, and; iii) Identifying hidden stars (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>).</p>, <p>One of the criticisms I’ve heard levied at ONA is that whilst the theory sounds great and the network graphs look wonderful, there aren’t enough quantifiable case studies that demonstrate business value. Au contraire. There are case studies if you take the time to find them such as the second article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a> on how Ramco deployed <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a>’s ONA solution to improve sales effectiveness, reduce time-to-productivity of new hires and reduce attrition.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 5 – </em></strong><em>Using passive ONA to identify a HiPO trainee vs. an average trainee (Source: Suvarna Joshi, TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I always enjoy <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a>'s thought provoking articles on people analytics, and his latest effort is no exception. Morten explains why psychological knowledge is essential to success in people analytics and why it should be a core component of the ‘Superhero’ team (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> Below). Morten then uses the example of a recruiting algorithm to highlight the importance of effort justification, a well-known element in social psychology, to support his argument that psychological skills are even more important than statistical capabilities when it comes to people analytics.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 6: </em></strong><em>The skills required in a People Analytics team of superheroes (Source: Morten Kamp Andersen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Unless you happen to be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Winkle"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rip van Winkle</a>, you’ll be fully aware of the considerable hype over ‘AI in HR’, but is it real or are we being seduced by a pack of vendor wolves in woollen jumpers? This collection of five articles offers a gamut of views. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> cuts through the hype and offers a sensible analysis of what is currently possible with AI, which perhaps unsurprisingly isn’t quite what many vendors are claiming. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomredman/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Redman</a> tackles a fundamental capability required to do machine learning – good quality data: first in the historical data used to train the predictive model, and second in the new data used by that model to make future decisions. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisdebrusk/"" target=""_blank"">Chris DeBrusk</a> looks at perhaps one of the biggest risks to technologies built on machine learning – biased data, before providing guidance on how this can be mitigated. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laetitia-vitaud-1058ba82/"" target=""_blank"">Laetitia Vitaud</a>’s article adopts a more positive stance and looks at the possibilities AI offers HR to personalise the services it offers to employees. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeannemeister/"" target=""_blank"">Jeanne Meister</a>’s article in Forbes provides two examples from Marriott and Hilton of how they harnessed machine learning to improve candidate and employee experience respectively.     </p>, <p>April saw a plethora of must-listen podcasts on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work. Here are my favourite five. Firstly, it’s always good to listen to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunchidambaram/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Chidambaram</a> speak about people analytics and his conversation with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8/"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a> is as stimulating as it is comprehensive. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> outlines his concept of systems thinking to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, and how this approach can help realise the full potential of people analytics. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> talks to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariannahuffington/"" target=""_blank"">Arianna Huffington</a> on his WorkLife podcast about the dangers of letting work and technology take over our lives. The always listenable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattalder/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Alder</a>’s guest on the excellent Recruiting Future podcast, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/robmccargow/"" target=""_blank"">Rob McCargow</a>, provides a quite brilliant analysis of AI – cutting through the hype, providing examples of use cases and discussing the very real dangers of biased data. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> continues his excellent series of talking to some of the most innovative vendors in our space, in his discussion with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-weiner-4843a08/"" target=""_blank"">Sara Weiner</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/shane-combest-3212b45a/"" target=""_blank"">Shane Combest</a> of <a href=""https://www.glintinc.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glint</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As one of the main authors of the Global Human Capital Trends report and arguably the most recognised and influential authority on the HR discipline in the world, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> is one of the biggest draws on the conference circuit (he is one of the headline speakers at <a href=""http://www.unleashgroup.io/america/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> in Las Vegas on 15-16 May). Josh probably delivers more insights per minute than any other speaker, so if you get distracted in the conference hall even for a second, you’ve likely missed something really important. So, the opportunity to watch Josh speak on video armed with pause and rewind buttons is unmissable! The video below shows Josh speaking at the <a href=""https://www.hrdsummit.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRD Summit</a> in the UK in February 2018 on the five mandates for HR in the coming years and how the function can best provide value to leaders and employees alike.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As referenced at the outset of this piece, April was a busy as well as a momentous one for me. I had the good fortune of being the chair of the fifth (and best yet) edition of <a href=""https://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> in London. The week after I delivered the opening keynote and co-ran a masterclass with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> at the <a href=""http://peopleanalyticsforum.eu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR &amp; People Analytics Forum</a> in Budapest, which as well as seeing a mix of local and international speakers made it clear that people analytics as a discipline is making strides in Eastern Europe too.

David R. Green,The best HR & People Analytics articles of May 2018,2018,Qtr2,Jun,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-may-2018-david-green/,"[<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-april-2018-david-green"" target=""_blank"">Last month</a> I highlighted that people analytics had emerged as the joint top trend in the <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Deloitte 2018 Global Human Capital Trends</a> report. This signal that people analytics has now properly ‘arrived’ continued to grow in May, first as data featured prominently as part of the superb UNLEASH show in Las Vegas (see my <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/news/6-takeaways-from-unleash-america"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">key takeaways article</a>). Further reinforcement also came with the publication of the <a href=""https://hros.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Open Source</a> (#HROS) Future of Work Report which, (as <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below shows) highlighted that people analytics is now regarded as a foundational capability by HR professionals themselves. This augurs well for data-driven decision making to become the norm within HR.   </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: Key insights from #HROS Future of Work Survey (Source: HR Open Source) </em></p>, <p>Congratulations to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsschmidt/"" target=""_blank"">Lars Schmidt</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambrosiavertesi/"" target=""_blank"">Ambrosia Vertesi</a> on the continued growth of #HROS and the value it continues to provide to the community and also to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgelarocque/"" target=""_blank"">George LaRocque</a> for what is an absorbing report (Download the report <a href=""https://hros.co/future-of-work-2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p>, <p>Now on with this month’s countdown:</p>, <p>We kick off this month with the latest opus from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> (this time in concert with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-van-den-brink/"" target=""_blank"">Frank van den Brink</a>), which showcases the latest developments and thinking on people analytics at ABN Amro. I always enjoy Patrick’s commentary as not only is he one of the leading practitioners in our space, but he typically breaks new ground each time he publishes an article. That is certainly the case with this collaboration with Frank, which introduces the ‘Second wall for People Analytics’ (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>). This update of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a>’s wall focuses on the challenge of providing continuous analytics and leads in neatly to the main topic of the article – the continuous listening journey at ABN Amro. Frank and Patrick define what ‘continuous listening’ means to the bank, describe the active and passive data sources in scope and then lay out the path ahead in this critical area of employee insight. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-stevens-phd-2ba63225/"" target=""_blank"">Laura Stevens</a> gets a deserved mention from Patrick for her contribution to the debate on continuous listening – you can read my recently published article with Laura <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dos-donts-continuous-listening-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: The ‘Second wall for People Analytics’ (Source: Patrick Coolen and Frank van den Brink)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In last month’s countdown, I featured two articles that had been serialised by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> from his new book ‘<a href=""https://www.koganpage.com/product/data-driven-hr-9780749482466"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Data-Driven HR</a>’. Bernard has a rare knack of being able to describe often complex technologies and techniques in a language everyone can relate to. This time Bernard turns his attention to the GDPR and what it really means for HR. Even though the legislation has now come into effect, many HR teams are still floundering. As such, Bernard’s explanation of concepts such as privacy, consent, transparency and data protection is very timely. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this fascinating interview with <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, who leads the people analytics team at Microsoft, provides a compelling account on how to straddle the research-practice divide and bring people analytics to the business. As Dawn explains, balancing the rigour of research with the timelines of the business is a continual challenge. This means that businesses typically opt for correlational research and quasi-experiments in favour of research-based experiments into causal validity. Dawn offers a wealth of invaluable advice, emphasising the importance of partnering with the business, the need for continual learning and two-way knowledge sharing. The fifteen years of people analytics at Microsoft seems time well spent though as Dawn reflects that when it comes to talent development it is “<em>hard for us to imagine how we could have made progress without it</em>”.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Agility is described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> in his article as the key organisational capability of our time.  He goes on to explain that in our world of unrelenting change agility matters at four levels: strategic, organisational, individual and last but not least HR. Ulrich’s persuasive argument that “<em>HR practices around people, performance, information, and work can be crafted to foster strategic, organisation, and individual agility</em>” is both convincing and inspiring. This leads nicely on to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliacrocker/"" target=""_blank"">Alia Crocker</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidi-k-gardner-ab5b825/"" target=""_blank"">Heidi Gardner</a>’s article in HBR, which focuses on applying organisational network analysis (ONA) to help foster collaboration and agility in employee networks where it matters most - at the point of execution, where teams are working on new products, strategic initiatives, or with top clients (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>). Two inspiring articles that provide a big clue as to the future direction of HR, underpinned by analytics and which should be read alongside <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annatavis/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Tavis</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-cappelli-14936a3/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cappelli</a>’s superb recent HBR cover article ‘HR goes agile’ (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-march-2018-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">see our March countdown</a>). </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3: </em></strong><em>To manage collaboration, pay attention to four points of execution (Source: Harvard Business Review, Alia Crocker, Rob Cross and Heidi K. Gardner)</em></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>ONA and its role in people analytics was the subject of my speech at May’s <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> show in Las Vegas and also the theme of this article, which is designed to demystify what has rapidly become a topic du jour for HR and business leaders. It includes a definition of ONA, why the technique is increasing in importance, the difference between active and passive ONA, and examples of what companies can use ONA for. It also provides four case studies from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> at GM, <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> at Microsoft.  </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>Example use cases of Organisational Network Analysis (Source: David Green)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst not limited to the HR function, people analytics practitioners will relate to many of the red flags described in this revealing McKinsey article. Familiar challenges such as the absence of a clear vision from the executive team with regards to analytics, a lack of analytics translators, costly data cleansing exercises and an inability to attribute bottom line impact are all present. Another red flag described is that analytics roles are generally poorly defined, with the authors using <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> to outline the variety of talent and well-defined roles required. A sobering but ultimately insightful read. </p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>: <em>Organisations need a variety of analytics talent with well-defined roles (Click on the image to access the article/infographic where you can click on each role to see its responsibilities)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Two of the most astute observers in our field analyse the latest developments in the people analytics space. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> succinctly captures the latest major trends in what he prefers to call the ‘workforce analytics’ domain, describing the shift to continuous analytics and the increase in focus on productivity, teams, transparency and personalisation. Tom also offers some cautionary words on the inherent challenges in predicting human behaviour. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers/"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> also accentuates the positive in reflecting on the findings of the <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Deloitte 2018 Global Human Capital Trends</a> report, highlighting that the growth in people analytics can partly be attributed to a renewed focus on productivity and engagement. Luk also provides an interesting insight that for the first time in five years the gap between the importance of analytics and the readiness of organisations to practice it has fallen. Whether this is an indication that the tide has turned, or it is merely a blip, only time will tell. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/39748903jkljdl/"" target=""_blank"">Jason McPherson</a>, <a href=""https://www.cultureamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Culture Amp</a>’s Chief Scientist, continues to churn out some really insightful articles and this month he turns his attention to the significant impact leadership has on culture and engagement. As Jason explains, a decline in employee perception of leaders can lead to a sharp fall in engagement levels and take a long time to turn around. Fortunately, surveys can provide early indications that things might be about to go awry, which at least means that organisations can take preventative steps to avoid slipping off the cliff edge. Then based on data from over 200,000 people, Jason outlines (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong>) some of the key characteristics of good vs. poor leaders.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong><em>: Indicators of good vs. poor leadership (Source: Culture Amp, Jason McPherson)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This is a clever and fascinating article that asks the reader to step into the shoes of Aliyah and make a decision on whether to hire Molly (as per her instinct) or Ed, who the hiring algorithm and network analysis provided by the people analytics team predicts will be the stronger hire. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-polzer-17391612/"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Polzer</a>’s article features the thoughts of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5/"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a>, who leads Google’s People Analytics team, and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/pattymccord/"" target=""_blank"">Patty McCord</a>, ex-Chief Talent Officer of Netflix. The <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6408201576145653760/"" target=""_blank"">discussion thread</a> when I posted this is fascinating – I particularly enjoyed <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marktlawrence/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Lawrence</a>’s comment <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6408365057377337344/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. If you were Aliyah, what would you do?</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>In a month where a BBC article described the <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44310225"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">top 10 worst excuses for not appointing women executives</a> it seems timely to provide several reminders as to why diversity in all its forms is not only the right thing to do but is good for business too. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> analyses research that suggests women actually make better leaders than men. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> highlights data from McKinsey (see <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong>) that links executive diversity in both gender and ethnicity to stronger business performance whilst warning that we must not rest on our laurels. Next Unilever CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nairleena/"" target=""_blank"">Leena Nair</a> provides a very personal account of why diversity is important to her. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/frida-polli-03a1855/"" target=""_blank"">Frida Polli</a> presents a ‘Diversity Tech Stack’ – technologies including her own company <a href=""https://www.pymetrics.com/employers/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pymetrics</a> as well as the likes of <a href=""https://textio.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Textio</a>, <a href=""https://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a> and <a href=""https://www.hackerrank.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HackerRank</a> that have been proven to enhance diversity outcomes in the hiring and promotion processes with global companies. The latest #HROS Case Study provides an excellent example of how (and why) Atlassian improved the gender and ethnic diversity of its technical graduate hires (kudos to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominic-price-0892243/"" target=""_blank"">Dom Price</a> and the Atlassian team for their continued sharing of their talent management practices). Finally, a revealing piece in The Atlantic on how Slack outperforms other Silicon Valley tech giants like Google and Facebook on diversity despite not having a designated ‘head of diversity’.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7: </em></strong><em>Gender and ethnic diversity are clearly correlated with profitability, but women and minorities remain underrepresented (Source: Keith McNulty | McKinsey, Delivering on Diversity)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This month’s collection of podcasts kicks off with a fascinating discussion between <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> on how ONA helped drive innovation at GM as well as previewing Michael’s forthcoming book ‘<a href=""https://www.adaptivespace.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Adaptive Space</a>’. Then McKinsey’s head honcho <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicsbarton/"" target=""_blank"">Dominic Barton</a> outlines why talent should be at the top of the CEO agenda (see <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong> for summary). <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annaott/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Ott</a>, who leads <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/startup"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH StartUp</a> then joins <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghanmbiro/"" target=""_blank"">Meghan Biro</a> for an insightful exploration of the future of HR Tech, which leads nicely on to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurieruettimann/"" target=""_blank"">Laurie Ruettimann</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattalder/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Alder</a> discussing on the Recruiting Future podcast how to fix HR Tech.

David R. Green,The best HR & People Analytics articles of June 2018,2018,Qtr3,Jul,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-june-2018-david-green/,"[<p>We are in the midst of World Cup fever here in the UK – England even won a penalty shootout against Colombia this week, defying the predictive algorithm (and history) in the process. The data now suggests that England has a reasonably good chance of making it to the World Cup Final on 15th July. One can only hope <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM"" target=""_blank"">it’s coming home</a>!</p>, <p>The only thing as popular as football currently in our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re4aDJL3heA"" target=""_blank"">world in motion</a> is of course people analytics (no, really!) and June was a busy month for me with speaking engagements in London, St Petersburg, Paris and Toronto. </p>, <p>At the end of June, I was in Zurich where <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> unveiled <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a>’s new Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People AnalyticsTM model (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>) to their European clients. I have been fortunate to work with Jonathan in the development of this model in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-reasons-ive-joined-insight222-board-advisor-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">my role as Board Advisor to Insight222</a>. More detail on the model will follow in the coming weeks: It's something I'm really excited about<strong><em>. </em></strong></p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>: <em>The Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People AnalyticsTM (Source: Insight222 Limited)</em></p>, <p>In tribute to the World Cup, I’ve extended the usual 10 articles to an XI this month. I’m confident that this line-up could take on anyone:</p>, <p>One of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">the hottest areas of people analytics and HR is ONA</a> and how it can be used to identify insights that help drive improvements in critical areas such as productivity, innovation, collaboration and performance. This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/antony-ebelle-ebanda-07642b/"" target=""_blank"">Antony Ebelle-Ebanda</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> of <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> is a terrific primer on what ONA is and why it’s growing in importance. Most helpful though is the practical examples offered on how ONA can be applied to support i) identification of HiPOs, ii) measurement of leadership behaviours, iii) improving employee wellness, and iv) increasing diversity and inclusion (see example in <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>). A valuable addition to the growing resources available on ONA, which I’ll be featuring in my next <a href=""https://us18.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=e0b52874f211caf2aa39d4929&amp;id=8848ad53e3"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Data Driven HR Newsletter</a>, which you can <a href=""http://eepurl.com/dqO4_5"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">subscribe to here</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: Significant gender differences in networking behaviour (Source: TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p>June saw the publication of not just one, or two but three outstanding research studies on the field of people analytics from the CIPD, i4CP/ROI Institute and LinkedIn Talent Solutions.</p>, <p>The <a href=""https://www.cipd.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CIPD</a> study provides a host of insights, not least that a strong people analytics culture leads to positive business outcomes as well as <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong> below, which suggests that confidence in conducting analysis varies significantly in the regions covered by the research – the UK appears to have much less confidence in analytics than it does about the chances of England at the World Cup.

Examples on how to build a people analytics team and case studies are provided from the likes of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwhite612/"" target=""_blank"">David White</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrislouie/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Louie</a>, who lead people analytics at LinkedIn and Nielsen respectively.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: North American companies apply HR Analytics by industry (Source: LinkedIn Talent Solutions)</em></p>, <p>File all three studies under mandatory reading.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The next two articles detail a case study from Microsoft's people analytics team and then an interview with the Head of People Analytics at Capital One.</p>, <p>Onboarding is a critical but often overlooked component with bad experience and processes contributing to unnecessary and avoidable attrition. This case study describes how Microsoft’s People Analytics team combined qualitative (survey of new hires at seven and 90 days) and quantitative (calendar and email meta data) data with engagement data to reveal insights to help inform the onboarding process moving forward. The key discovery being that it is critical for a new employee to have a one-on-one meeting with their manager during their first week. Those who did saw early growth in three key areas: network strength and centrality, better quality meetings and early team collaboration.</p>, <p>The third in an excellent <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">re:Work</a> series of interviews with people analytics leaders, which previously featured <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> (see #3 <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-may-2018-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetanjali-gamel-17209b68/"" target=""_blank"">Geetanjali Gamel</a> (#5 <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-march-2018-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). This time <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a>, who leads the team at Capital One, provides a number of invaluable insights not least on how to increase the likelihood of insights leading to actions (the last mile problem for people analytics?). In this critical element of people analytics, Guru recommends: i) productising insights and putting them in the hands of decision makers, ii) building strong relationships with business leaders, and iii) building and deploying products for employees.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If you could name one person to write a Foreword to a study assessing the impact of AI on HR then it would be <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>, so credit to <a href=""https://cognitionx.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CognitionX</a> for doing just that. Josh’s Foreword highlights the ‘killer apps’ emerging across HR (e.g. recruiting, learning, engagement etc) and examines the risks (aka ethics) and what all this means for the field of people analytics. The report itself is an extensive study on the impact of AI on HR, which includes one of the best categorisations I've come across yet of the vendors driving innovation in the HR space (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong> below). Click here to download the report (and Josh’s Foreword). Great work from my Insight222 partner-in-crime <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> alongside <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/meganmariebutler/"" target=""_blank"">Megan Marie Butler</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>Fig 6</em></strong><em>: HR AI Market Scan: 60+ companies gaining traction (Source: CognitionX)</em></p>, <p>In this revealing article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> highlights <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TI People</a> research on the need for HR to focus on skill management in order to enable organisational agility. The research also emphasises how companies are shifting from the traditional way of segmenting the workforce by role and function to one based on skills (see <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong>). Volker then outlines the five key building blocks of a skills-based organisation, as determined through co-creation with members of TI People's <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/digital-hr-program"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Digital HR Program</a> such as Cisco, Zalando and Solvay, and technology to enable an agile workforce.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong><em>: The shift in how companies segment their workforce towards skills (Source: TI People)</em></p>, <p>In this article for <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a>, I interviewed <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/trishuhl/"" target=""_blank"">Trish Uhl</a>, one of the leading experts globally on learning and development. The insights and examples Trish provided are fascinating and cover areas such as: i) the key challenges in the L&amp;D space that people analytics is helping organisations to address, ii) linkage to business outcomes and employee experience, iii) how analytics and AI is revolutionising how L&amp;D programs are designed, delivered and evaluated, and iv) advice to HR leaders looking to apply people analytics in the L&amp;D domain.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the most popular articles in last month’s collection was <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a>’s article on agility being the key organisational capability of our time. It goes without saying that Ulrich is one of the leading global authorities on HR and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/detail/recent-activity/posts/"" target=""_blank"">his weekly articles on LinkedIn</a> are a must-read for all of us who seek to progress the field to make it ""<em>pivotal for business success and employee wellbeing</em>"". This article describes the need for HR to shift from circular thinking (repeating the past) to spiral thinking (creating the future).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Last month’s ‘Diversity Special’ proved so popular, I decided to reprise it with four new articles to illustrate how people analytics can support, further and validate diversity and inclusion programs. First up, another terrific study from the CIPD provides evidence on the business case for diversity and then highlights the key actions needed to drive change. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-richmond/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Richmond</a> summarises the discussions at a recent <a href=""https://www.meetup.com/HRAnalyticsPros/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">New York Strategic HR Analytics MeetUp</a>*, covering what inclusion means, how to measure it, the role of technology and what the future of inclusion is. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminssnyder/"" target=""_blank"">Benjamin Snyder</a> summarises the highlights of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lesliehm/"" target=""_blank"">Leslie Miley</a>’s recent speech at the New York edition of LinkedIn’s Talent Intelligence Experience on how data can be used to make workplaces more inclusive and equitable. Finally, behavioural scientists <a href=""https://twitter.com/iamlindachang"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Linda Chang</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/profcikara"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mina Cikara</a> describe the results of experiments they took to see if you can reduce bias in the hiring process.</p>, <p>*<em>Brian is one of the co-organisers of the New York Strategic HR Analytics Meetup Group along with </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/slupushor/"" target=""_blank""><em>Stela Lupushor</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyashapiro/"" target=""_blank""><em>Jeremy Shapiro</em></a><em> and </em><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiparkcoll/"" target=""_blank""><em>Philip Arkcoll</em></a><em>. The group has over 1100 members, and I highly recommend it to anyone residing in the New York area who is working or interested in the field of people analytics.</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I came across less people analytics themed podcasts than usual in June, but these two gems are certainly worth a spin. First, the always listenable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattalder/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Alder</a> speaks to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinblair/"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Blair</a>, Global VP of Talent Acquisition, about the cognitive recruiting journey at IBM on the Recruiting Future podcast. Then, the equally listenable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/meghanmbiro/"" target=""_blank"">Meghan Biro</a> discusses the power of people data with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/katehastings/"" target=""_blank"">Kate Hastings</a>, Senior Director of Insights at LinkedIn, and how HR is using people data to eliminate bias, close the gender gap, and drive better outcomes.</p>, <p>I’m currently immersed in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a>’s new book ‘Adaptive Space’. The book describes how, in his role as Chief Talent Officer, Michael applied ONA to foster networks, ideas, information and resources to drive innovation at GM, as well as how other organisations have also applied a similar approach. From what I've read so far I can highly recommend Michael’s book and believe it is a landmark publication in terms of providing evidence of the power of ONA. If you need further endorsement, you might want to check out <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobsutton1/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Sutton</a>’s review <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/yes-elephant-can-dance-general-motors-chief-talent-officer-bob-sutton/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The recent <a href=""https://cogx.co/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">CogX</a> event in London was a roaring success with over 6,500 attendees and 370 speakers over the two days. If you were one of the unlucky ones (like me) who couldn’t get along, never fear because the helpful people at CognitionX have made videos of most of the sessions available on their YouTube channel. The highlight for me is this engrossing discussion on the impact of AI on HR and recruitment, chaired by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> and featuring an esteemed panel of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissa-gee-kee-167b705/"" target=""_blank"">Melissa Gee Kee</a> (Unilever), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock/"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a>. Tons of insights in this must-watch 37 minute video.</p>, <p>June was a packed month for conferences.

David R. Green,The best HR & People Analytics articles of September 2018,2018,Qtr4,Oct,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-september-2018-david-green/,"[<p>They say that good things come to those that wait, and I believe that old adage certainly applies to my collection of the best people analytics articles for September.</p>, <p>Usually, this article would have been published seven days earlier but the first week of October proved to be a momentous week.</p>, <p>First, <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> (where I am a board advisor) held its inaugural Global Executive Retreat in the countryside an hour or so outside Philadelphia. The Retreat brought together the people analytics leader from 35 of Insight222’s current 45 strong group of European and North American member organisations for what proved to be a memorable three days.</p>, <p>This blend of Europe and North America continued with the <a href=""https://pafow.com/pafow18east/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work East</a> conference in Philadelphia, which followed directly after the Retreat. Once again, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> organised a stellar event, which included speakers from the US and 'across the pond' such as Ian O’Keefe, Charlotte Nagy, Patrick Coolen, Marilyn Becker, Arun Chidambaram, Brydie Lear, Alec Levenson, Lexy Martin, Ian Bailie and Google’s Cassie Kozyrkov. I’ll be publishing something about the conference shortly, but for now do check out <a href=""https://bunch.ai/blog/people-analytics-trends-2018/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this excellent writeup of PAFOW highlights</a> from Darja Gutnick.</p>, <p>Then two huge announcements this week confirmed that the people analytics field is accelerating faster than Lewis Hamilton is away from Sebastian Vettel's forlorn Ferrari in this year's Formula One World Championship. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-glint-helping-talent-leaders-build-winning-teams-shapero/"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn announced the acquisition of Glint</a> and then Laszlo Bock announced <a href=""https://humu.com/2018/10/08/humu-nudge-engine-make-work-better/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the official launch of Humu</a>, whose eagerly awaited Nudge Engine promises a blend of 'science, machine learning, and a little love'.</p>, <p>The main draw for the rest of October is the <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/amsterdam"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH World Conference</a> in Amsterdam on 23-24th October. If you haven’t been to an UNLEASH event before, I can promise you won’t be disappointed. If you have, well this year’s show is shaping up to be the best yet. If you are going, I look forward to seeing you there.</p>, <p>Now, without further ado let’s proceed to this month’s countdown:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>We start with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a>, who kicked off Insight222’s Global Executive Retreat with a mesmerising overview of the multiple opportunities advances in technology and real-time data collection offers to the people analytics discipline. Ben focused much of his time on privacy and ethics, drawing from what is arguably the definitive article written to date on this absolutely critical subject. After outlining examples of how these technologies are, for example, helping reduce gender bias, fatigue and attrition, Ben walks through a playbook for the ethical and smart use of employee data (see <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong>). As Ben concludes, the potential of people analytics to improve decision making is astounding, but failure by organisations to protect employee data could erode this potential for good.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: A Playbook for the ethical, smart use of employee data (Source: created by David Green from Ben Waber's 'The Happy Tracked Employee' article in HBR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Earlier this year, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> and I mulled over the three key questions we regularly get asked by people analytics leaders: How can I improve my impact? How can I create more value? What should I focus on? This formed the basis for our <em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</em> model, which we created in the weeks following our discussion, and is now being used by several organisations to help evaluate, focus and prioritise their people analytics strategies. Jonathan’s article outlines each of the nine dimensions, which we grouped in three categories: foundational aspects (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>), resources and value. If you are a people analytics leader who wants to find out more, please <a href=""http://mailto:david.green@insight222.com?subject=RE:%20Nine%20Dimensions%20for%20Excellence%20in%20People%20Analytics%20model%20|%20Best%20People%20Analytics%20Articles%20for%20September"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">get in touch</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: The Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics - Foundation (Source: Jonathan Ferrar, David Green, Insight222)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-phd-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a> is leading the charge for Organisational Network Analysis from a practitioner perspective in his work as Chief Talent Officer at GM and through his terrific recent book <a href=""https://www.adaptivespace.net/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Adaptive Space</em></a>. In this article, Michael contests that whilst human capital is undoubtedly a firm’s greatest asset, bringing <u>in</u> the best people is only part of the solution, and that organisations must also bring <u>out</u> the best in people. To do this entails a new frontier, unleashing social capital potential. Michael then outlines two primary aspects of social capital —group cohesion and brokerage— that are particularly relevant to future HR practices. For more on ONA including several case studies, please read my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><em>The Role of ONA in People Analytics</em></a> primer.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>’s latest analysis of the people analytics field is as usual stacked full of golden nuggets and helpful tips. The article covers amongst other things: i) the latest people analytics technologies such as LinkedIn's new Talent Insights product (see later) plus others from Visier and ADP, ii) research on the top drivers of people analytics maturity (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>), iii) the importance of creating data literacy amongst HRBPs and the wider HR population, and; iv) analysis on where the market is headed as well as several case studies. As ever with anything Josh publishes, it's an absolute must-read.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong><em>: The top drivers of People Analytics maturity (Source: Josh Bersin, Bersin by Deloitte High-Impact People Analytics study)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I believe that the key responsibility of business leaders and HR is to be the custodians of employee well-being. In this respect, people analytics can be a force for good as it can not only shine a light on good or bad practice, but it can be used to finally prove the link between wellbeing and business performance. In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-pfeffer-57a01b6/"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Pfeffer</a> examines two typically overlooked essential areas of employee well-being: job control (the amount of discretion employees have to determine what they do and how they do it) and social support (family and friends you can count on, as well as close relationships). Just like Pfeffer’s recently published book, <a href=""http://mailto:https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dying-Paycheck-Jeffrey-Pfeffer/dp/0062800922"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Dying for a Paycheck</em></a>, it is a powerful and sobering read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>With the news that <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-glint-helping-talent-leaders-build-winning-teams-shapero/"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn has acquired Glint</a>, the market for employee listening has never been so hot and has extended well beyond the traditional survey field. This is captured perfectly in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-silverman-33a6177/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Silverman</a>’s landscape of the employee listening technology space (see <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong>). Michael has done a superb job of capturing the vast majority of leading players in this space and the way he has split these into categories such as Text Analytics, ONA, Innovation as well as Survey technologies is extremely helpful.</p>, <p><strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong><em>: The Employee Listening Technology Landscape 2018 (Source: Michael Silverman, Silverman Research)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>To read the rest of the countdown for September, please <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/10/10/the-best-hr-amp-people-analytics-articles-of-september-2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>head over to myHRfuture</strong></a>, where you can also read articles by: Peter Hinssen, Laura Stevens, a collaboration between Alexis Fink and Keith McNulty, Francesca Gino, LinkedIn Talent Solutions research featuring David White and Chris Louie, Fredrik Johnsson, Stacey Harris and Erin Spencer, John Sumser, Andrew Spence, Stacia Shermann Garr and the World Economic Forum.

David R. Green,The best HR & People Analytics articles of October 2018,2018,Qtr4,Nov,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-october-2018-david-green/,"[<p>October proved to be another bumper month for the field of people analytics, with the personal highlight for me being my fireside chat with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a> on the main stage at UNLEASH where we discussed ‘The Moral Imperative of People Analytics’.</p>, <p>UNLEASH confirmed that people analytics is now a core component of strategic thinking around the future of the workforce and the HR organisation needed to support it. This can also be seen in the articles I’ve selected this month, which cover areas such as creating a data-driven culture, the role of the CHRO, the rise of organisational network analysis, the shift from HR strategies focused on people management to ones based on skills, the continued evolution of the employee engagement market, and a special selection of articles on algorithmic fairness in wake of the recent news that Amazon binned a hiring algorithm that was perpetuating bias against women. </p>, <p>Thanks to Amit for his wise words and to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/leah-narodetsky-1299a095/"" target=""_blank"">Leah Narodetsky</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marccoleman/"" target=""_blank"">Marc Coleman</a> and the <a href=""https://www.unleashgroup.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">UNLEASH</a> team for making it happen and also for the opportunity to MC the main stage at what proved to be the biggest and best UNLEASH show yet.</p>, <p><em>TALKING ABOUT THE MORAL IMPERATIVE OF PEOPLE ANALYTICS WITH AMIT MOHINDRA AT UNLEASH IN AMSTERDAM</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Please note that the articles selected are ordered by topic, so on with the show...</p>, <p>Creating a culture of analytics within the wider HR function is a critical step in achieving sustainable capability in people analytics. This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2/"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a/"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> is invaluable in this regard. First, the authors provides a smart categorisation of HR professionals that are analytically savvy, willing or resistant. Then their article describes ways you can hire for and/or develop analytical capability. With people analytics now becoming table stakes, this is a very timely read.</p>, <p><em>FIG 1: THREE CATEGORIES OF HR PROFESSIONALS AND THEIR ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES</em></p>, <p>A really helpful and practical guide to five key barriers that inhibit the progress of people analytics and the creation of a data-driven HR function. The article which describes barriers such as a lack of trust in data, an inability for companies to focus on solving real business problems and the very real risk of misunderstanding the basics of data. The advice offered by contributors to the article – particularly <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink/"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a> but also <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhousman/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Housman</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475/"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/danstaleyhr/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Staley</a> provide a good guide to organisations seeking to overcome these obstacles.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Only 11% of business leaders trust HR to use data to anticipate and help them fill their talent needs. That's the worrying finding in the 2018 DDI, Conference Board and EY Global Leadership Survey featured in this article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar/"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccalearay/"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca Ray</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-canwell/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Canwell</a>. The authors offer four steps for HR leaders to improve their data literacy as illustrated in Figure 2 below.</p>, <p><em>FIG 2: FOUR STEPS FOR HR LEADERS TO IMPROVE THEIR DATA LITERACY</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article from the November-December issue of HBR, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-leonardi-45b67321/"" target=""_blank"">Paul Leonardi</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/noshcontractor/"" target=""_blank"">Noshir Contractor</a> state that most people analytics teams rely on a narrow approach restricted to data on individuals. They argue that if the field is going to live up to the hype, people analytics teams need to also explore data on the interplay between people to understand how they interact, who has influence, what fosters innovation etc. The result is one of the best articles I've read yet on the case for passive organisational network analysis (or as the authors describe it in the article – ‘relational analytics’). The Six Signatures of Relational Analytics that is presented (see <em>Figure 3</em>) covering Ideation, Influence, Efficiency, Innovation, Silos and Vulnerability is a powerful starting point for people analytics teams looking to mine the digital exhaust of their workforce. The future’s bright, the future’s ONA. For more on ONA including several case studies, please read my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank""><em>The Role of ONA in People Analytics</em></a> primer. You also might want to read <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-study-accelerating-multibillion-dollar-telecom-merger-mar%C3%ADn/"" target=""_blank"">this case study</a> from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscomarinruz/"" target=""_blank"">Francisco Marin</a> on how ONA helped accelerate a multi-million dollar merger of two telecom companies in Europe.</p>, <p><em>FIG 3: THE SIX SIGNATURES OF RELATIONAL ANALYTICS (SOURCE: PAUL LEONARDI AND NOSHIR CONTRACTOR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the not too distant future I believe that the GDPR will be seen as a positive for people analytics as it should help curtail projects that are simply 'creepy'. For that to happen, HR must take ownership of GDPR, embrace the new responsibilities and use the legislation to add value to the business. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/spherehr-spheredp/"" target=""_blank"">Kim Bradford</a> is not only an expert on the GDPR but is also a HR practitioner, and her article offers practical guidance for HR on how they can seize the opportunity offered through GDPR. Her message that ""<em>HR is an ideal business partner for implementing GDPR compliance within businesses</em>"" certainly resonates. Kim has recently launched a course on GDPR for HR professionals over on myHRfuture. Click <a href=""https://academy.myhrfuture.com/p/introduction-to-gdpr-for-hr"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> to find out more.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A superb guide from data scientist <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-richmond/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Richmond</a>, who founded the people analytics team at WeWork, on how to predict employee turnover Using R. I frequently get asked for practical guides such as this, and Brian's article is detailed, well-written and highly educational. As Brian writes, employee turnover is a challenge for many organisations, so this is likely to be an indispensable resource for many budding people analysts.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong><em>: TERMINATIONS BY REASON AND DEPARTMENT (SOURCE: BRIAN RICHMOND)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This McKinsey study provides a broad view on the opportunities and challenges presented by the new age of artificial intelligence. One of the six focus areas investigated zeroes in on the profound impact AI and automation will have on the world of work (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong> below). The key takeaway from the study from a people perspective is that workers will need different skills to thrive in the workplace of the future.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>AUTOMATION WILL HAVE A FAR-REACHING EFFECT ON THE GLOBAL WORKFORCE (SOURCE: MCKINSEY GLOBAL INSTITUTE)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Josh’s second entry on the countdown this month plots a course through the history of the employee engagement market. He argues that with the launch of Humu – which Josh refers to as the first behavioural company in our space – the engagement market has reached a third major evolution (see <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong>) that could even see disruptors like Culture Amp, Glint (now owned of course by LinkedIn) and Peakon being disrupted themselves by Humu and other players that will doubtless enter this market. An absolute must-read.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8</em></strong><em> – THE EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT MARKET EVOLVES (SOURCE: JOSH BERSIN)</em></p>, <p>Just as digital technology has transformed the customer experience so is it now entering the workplace in the form of the consumerisation of HR. In his article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumyasanto/"" target=""_blank"">Soumyasanto Sen</a> outlines how companies are redesigning HR to provide positive touchpoints at every stage of the employee lifecycle. He emphasises the need to balance automation in some interactions with the desire from employees to have more human interaction in other HR-related tasks (see <strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong>). This blend of digital and human is perhaps best encapsulated in the evolution of how organisations are developing employee experience with technology enabling the personalisation of HR services to its workforce.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 9</em></strong><em> – THE GROWING DIGITAL AND HUMAN INTERACTIONS AT WORK (SOURCE: SOUMYASANTO SEN, BASED ON PWC)</em></p>, <p>A new addition to this column, which recognises that there have been so many wonderful articles written previously about people analytics. We start with one of the best articles ever written on the field…</p>, <p>This seminal paper provides a critique of the HR centric approach adopted by many organisations when it comes to analytics, instead advocating an “outside-in” method targeted at solving real business problems. Two excellent examples from Maersk Drilling are highlighted to support the argument. Case 1 examines the impact of leadership quality and crew competence on safety, operational performance, and customer satisfaction (see <strong><em>Figure 10</em></strong>) whilst Case 2 examines the ROI and Strategic Impact of a Technical Trainee Acceleration Program. Both cases show that analytics is far more effective when tackled from a business (rather than an inward-looking HR) perspective and that analytics needs to be treated as a change management process. The guidance offered by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> in this article is still highly relevant to the state of people analytics today.</p>, <p>I had the pleasure of interviewing <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosa-lee-33307a14/"" target=""_blank"">Rosa Lee</a> at the recent <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> Global Executive Retreat in Philadelphia about her experience of developing people analytics at Bosch, and of taking that critical step to build a data-driven culture in HR.

David R. Green,The best HR & People Analytics articles of November 2018,2018,Qtr4,Dec,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-november-2018-david-green/,"[<p>As we begin the countdown to Christmas, the penultimate month of 2018 provided further proof that the rise of people analytics continues to gather pace.</p>, <p>Hot on the heels of October’s acquisition of Glint by LinkedIn came the news that SAP had paid a whopping $8 billion to buy Qualtrics (read Josh Bersin’s analysis of the deal <a href=""https://joshbersin.com/2018/11/why-did-sap-pay-8-billion-to-acquire-qualtrics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). I fully expect further consolidation in our space as we move into 2019.</p>, <p>On the subject of next year, my list of speaking engagements for 2019 continues to grow (see list at end of article). My first major conference is the People Analytics &amp; Future of Work Conference in San Francisco (<a href=""https://pafow.com/pafow19/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW</a>) on 31st January and 1st February, which I’ll once again be co-chairing with Al Adamsen along with a stellar list of speakers. Click <a href=""https://pafow.com/pafow19/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> or on the image below and use my discount code DG200 by 31st December to get a $200 discount.</p>, <p>This month’s selections are grouped under the following seven topics: Getting started, building capability, the role of the people analytics leader, ethics and privacy, emerging data sources and techniques, data literacy and for the analyst. There’s also another classic article from the vault as well as the best podcast and video of the month. Enjoy and if you do, please do share with your network.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>Despite the significant growth in adoption of people analytics, many people professionals still lack the confidence and skills to make the most of their workforce data. As the preamble to the latest in a growing number of superb resources from the CIPD on people analytics explains, this guide is designed to help all people professionals of any level learn the basics and improve their confidence and capability when using data. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68/"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Ed Houghton</a> have produced an excellent primer and, as <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> demonstrates, also contributed to the debate on whether the field should be called HR, Workforce or People Analytics. As one who prefers the latter, this image is particularly pleasing.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: Scope of People Analytics (Source: Workforce Dimensions, CIPD)</em></strong> </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>How should you run a people analytics project to maximise the opportunity for success? In this excellent guide, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> outlines the Eight Step Model for Purposeful Analytics (see <strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong>) Nigel Guenole, Sheri Feinzig and he developed for the landmark <a href=""https://www.thepowerofpeople.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">'The Power of People</a>' book. A summary of each step is provided with perhaps the key message being each project always starting with a clearly defined business question.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: The Eight Step model for purposeful analytics (Source: The Power of People by Nigel Guenole, Jonathan Ferrar and Sheri Feinzig)</em></strong></p>, <p>What is the secret of a good HR dashboard? That is the question pondered by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcreelman/"" target=""_blank"">David Creelman</a> in his article. He argues that instead of continually falling into the trap of redefining the right metrics, tirelessly cleaning data and inventing new visualisations we should instead base our dashboards on questions. Creelman goes on to provide an example (see <strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong>) emphasising the need to compose your dashboard with the right questions, as a precursor to then using data to provide answers.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: Example of a HR dashboard composed of questions (Source: David Creelman and Peter Navin - The CMO of People: Manage Employees Like Customers With an Immersive Predictable Experience That Drives Productivity and Performance)</em></strong></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> shares my view that the majority of maturity models for people analytics are incomplete as they mostly focus on techniques rather than far more important aspects such as business outcomes. The model Thomas presents in this article is much more rooted in reality (see <strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong>) as the happy toddlers become grumpy teenagers before making the final transition to a mature people analytics team.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: People Analytics Maturity (Source: Thomas Rasmussen)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The role of the people analytics leader is absolutely pivotal to the success - or otherwise – of creating, building and sustaining people analytics within an organisation. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin/"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a>’s analysis draws out the unique set of skills required to thrive in this pioneering and challenging role, the reporting line (ideally direct to the CHRO), how to harness technology, drive change and create value.</p>, <p>Fascinating analysis by McKinsey on the evolution of the Chief Analytics Officer role over time and how the dominant required persona of the 'Catalyst' has now emerged (see <strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong>). The article is a must-read for any Head of People Analytics as the opportunities and challenges outlined are very similar. The authors explain that the ‘Catalyst’ helps redefine the leadership role for adopting analytics and AI at scale. Five key areas where Catalysts lead the charge and facilitate change are outlined including the need to act as an agent of change to navigate organisational barriers to analytics adoption.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: The evolution of the role of Chief Analytics Officer (Source: McKinsey)</em></strong></p>, <p>People analytics leader <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-mahon-49167645/"" target=""_blank"">Elaine Mahon</a> describes how she is delivering positive change at the Office for National Statistics through four key activities with the easy to remember ABCD acronym. These are: Adopt an <strong>A</strong>gile approach, <strong>B</strong>uild senior level engagement, <strong>C</strong>reate tangible actions and <strong>D</strong>eploy the right skills. An inspiring read and it's good to see people analytics thriving in the public sector.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Earlier this year, <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> (where I am a board advisor) worked with 15 Global500 member companies to co-create an ethics charter and guiding set of principles for the use of people data (see <strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong>). <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkpetersen1/"" target=""_blank"">Dirk Petersen</a>’s article describes the background and delivery of the project and six recommendations to help firms develop ethically sound people analytics. These include the need to i) align key stakeholders, and ii) demonstrate employee value. As Dirk concludes, getting management to take data ethics seriously is paramount to avoid a potentially fatal ‘Cambridge Analytica’ moment.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 6: People Analytics Ethics Decision Model (Source: Insight222)  </em></strong></p>, <p>For more on ethics, trust and people analytics for good, please check out the latest edition of Data Driven HR <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/zandel/data-driven-hr-7-nov-ethics-trust-people-data-244737"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, which collects together a wealth of resources on this most critical of topics.

Featuring a Foreword by CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-gherson-1b93b77/"" target=""_blank"">Diane Gherson</a>, the report also provides practical advice on the five steps to get started (see <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong>), the skills you will need, and important issues about fairness and the broader societal effects of AI on jobs. The paper is part research, part case study and part how-to guide, which put together makes it an indispensable read.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 7: Five steps to getting started with AI in HR (Source: IBM Smarter Workforce Institute)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Don’t be fooled by the title of this article as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-van-den-brink/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Van Den Brink</a>, Chief Employee Experience Officer at ABN Amro, and CX expert <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nienkebloem/"" target=""_blank"">Nienke Bloem</a> outline why focusing on the customer AND employee experience is critical. Methodologies are outlined to drive excellence in both CX and EX encompassing strategy, design, measurement, adoption and culture. An example of employee journey mapping as undertaken by Frank and his team at ABN Amro is highlighted in <strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong> below.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8: Employee Experience Journey Canvas at ABN Amro (Source: Frank Van Den Brink)</em></strong></p>, <p>2017’s excellent <a href=""http://marketing.bersin.com/rs/976-LMP-699/images/Infographic-HIPAN-TopFindings.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">High-Impact People Analytics</a> study by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a> for Bersin by Deloitte found that the biggest predictor of success in people analytics was the development of an organisational culture for data-driven decision making. A key element of this is to improve the data literacy of HR professionals. I featured a number of articles on this theme in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-october-2018-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">my October collection</a> and here are two more to digest. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drtomaschamorro/"" target=""_blank"">Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic</a> outlines three ways to build a data-driven team emphasising the need to foster critical thinking allied to training and hiring for the right skills. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomredman/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Redman</a> explains the need to think like a data scientist as one of his five concepts to helping your team be more data-driven.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A couple of articles for the more technically-minded. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hendrikfeddersen/"" target=""_blank"">Hendrik Feddersen</a> argues that partly due to the limitations of Excel in handling large amounts of data, budding HR analysts should instead learn how to use R, offering a number of compelling reasons why he believes this to be the case. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> examines the lack of use of control groups and regression to the mean in people analytics and how this threatens to undermine the evidence of business value created by the field. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The ‘classic article’ this month is actually a two-part piece by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen/"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a>, which presents the case for and the case against people analytics being under the auspices of the HR department. The articles provoked a healthy discussion four years ago, and the question of where the people analytics function should sit is a debate that continues to rage today. Which side of the fence do you fall down upon? Is people analytics stymied within the HR organisation or will its potential be unfulfilled if it is located within a group function focused on consumer analytics? I expect this debate to run and run.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’ve seen at first-hand at the Talent Intelligence Experience shows in Paris, Sydney and London this year the thirst amongst HR professionals for LinkedIn’s new Talent Insights product. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericowski/"" target=""_blank"">Eric Owski</a> leads the team that has developed this product and his discussion with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> provides a compelling account of the value it provides.</p>, <p>Taking the earlier theme of the role of the people analytics leader, I was delighted to recently interview two of the best around for <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">myHRfuture</a> in <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brydie-lear-4462a12/"" target=""_blank"">Brydie Lear</a>. In the first video, Patrick Coolen (below) describes how he has catalysed the growth of a data-driven HR function at ABN AMRO. In the second video, Brydie Lear outlines the advantages of reporting directly into the CHRO as she does as Global Head of People Analytics at ING. </p>, <p>This version of the countdown features a selection of the full set of articles for November, which you can find if you <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/12/2/the-best-hr-amp-people-analytics-articles-of-november-2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>head over to myHRfuture</strong></a>.

David R. Green,The best HR & People Analytics articles of December 2018,2018,Qtr4,Dec,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-december-2018-david-green/,"[<p>Yes, I know that there are still a few days left before December closes and a New Year begins, but given I start my Christmas holiday tomorrow I wanted to publish the ‘Best Articles’ for December before I submerge myself in mince pies.</p>, <p>I had expected December to be a quiet month for articles – save those looking back on 2018 and the usual glut of articles predicting what will occur in 2019. But, I was wrong. The selections that follow are especially strong and reinforce how 2018 has been a pivotal year for people analytics and data-driven HR.</p>, <p>If I had to pick out two of the selections that point the way forward, it is those penned first by Ravin Jesuthasan and John Boudreau. Every business leader, CHRO and Head of People Analytics should read their article on the Future of Work. The strategic questions laid out are ones that every organisation will have to answer if it is to thrive moving forward. The second must-read article comes from Al Adamsen on the unique role HR needs to play in designing appropriate strategies to contend with how work gets done in the future and the workforce composition required to deliver it.   </p>, <p>I have also included a selection of predictions for 2019 towards the end of this article – including my own <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-touch-10-predictions-hr-2019-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">‘The Human Touch’</a>. Together they show that whilst HR is undoubtedly being disrupted like never before, it is also one of the most exciting areas of the business in which to work and the opportunities to increase our impact through better understanding the business as well as being more data-driven and employee centric are enormous.</p>, <p>Before we get on with this month’s selections, I just wanted to wish readers a Merry Christmas, happy holidays as well as a happy and successful 2019. </p>, <p>Right, on we go…  </p>, <p>Will the inexorable rise of technology render humans obsolete in the workplace or instead will the work humans do be continually reinvented? These are the two scenarios considered by the authors in this taster to their landmark book <a href=""https://hbr.org/product/reinventing-jobs-a-4-step-approach-for-applying-automation-to-work/10174-HBK-ENG"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Reinventing Jobs</em></a>. As the title of the book suggests, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravinjesuthasan/"" target=""_blank"">Ravin Jesuthasan</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> believe the second scenario will prevail and as this transformation takes hold, humans will actually become more valuable in ways that would not be possible without automation. The frameworks outlined in the article (see example in <strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong>) are provided to help leaders consider how work should be ‘deconstructed’. A powerful example is provided analysing the job of pilots and flight attendants. The issue of Workforce Solutions Review in which this article appears is also recommended - see <a href=""http://www.ihrimpublications.com/amember/WSR_Archives/WSR_October-December18.php"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a> - as it also contains a number of other interesting analytics themed reads from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/royaltman/"" target=""_blank"">Roy Altman</a> (on using analytics to support organisational agility), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-friedman-b9450011/"" target=""_blank"">Helen Friedman</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annawmarley/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Marley</a> (on whether HR Business Partners are helping or hindering efforts to become more evidence based) and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-higgins-5875082/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Higgins</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: A framework for optimising human and automated work (Source: Reinventing Jobs, Jesuthasan and Boudreau, Harvard Business Press, 2018)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Following up his brilliant <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-30-al-adamsen/"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics 3.0</a> article from last year, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen/"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> examines the workforce composition of the future and introduces his Work Framework model to outline the value and changing make-up of the workforce (employees, contractors, consultants, outsource partners, machines etc). Al also outlines a model for Employee Experience Design (see <strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong>) and highlights that in tandem with a positive culture how this can lead to improvements in engagement, retention, productivity, innovation and ultimately financial performance. As Al outlines, this challenge represents a unique opportunity for HR and People Analytics to lead the way and ensure that not only the organisation benefits, but employees do too. If you want to see Al speaking about how HR manages the amoeba, check out the section later on the <a href=""https://pafow.com/pafow19/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work conference</a> in San Francisco on 31st January and 1st February.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: Employee Experience Design (Source: Al Adamsen)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Agility is described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> in his article on HR.com as the key organisational capability of our time. He goes on to explain that in our world of unrelenting change agility matters at four levels: strategic, organisational, individual and last but not least HR. Ulrich’s persuasive argument that “<em>HR practices around people, performance, information, and work can be crafted to foster strategic, organisation, and individual agility</em>” is both convincing and inspiring.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: The critical organisational capabilities to win have pivoted over time (Source: Dave Ulrich)</em></strong></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiparkcoll/"" target=""_blank"">Philip Arkcoll</a> provides an example of how organisational network analysis was used to answer a key question from a business leader: “Is our turnover problem contagious?” In other words, when a key employee goes does this make their peers more vulnerable to leaving too? Based on his study, Philip found that yes it does, with direct peers being two to three times more likely to exit when an employee exits a team. The article also provides findings from a survey conducted with employees to find out why turnover can be contagious.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: Network analysis showing clusters of turnover (Source: Philip Arkcoll)</em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Much of the research on engagement is traditionally focused on external drivers such as organisational culture, quality of leaders and role characteristics. However, as the authors explain in this fascinating article, a new study suggests that close to 50% of engagement can be predicted through individual personality with four traits highlighted: positive affect, proactivity, conscientiousness, and extroversion. Together, these traits represent some of the core ingredients of emotional intelligence and resilience. A must-read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcarty/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Carty</a>’s write-up of the recent CIPD HR Analytics conference focuses on the three principles of effective people analytics he saw emerge from the conference. The first principle of understanding the business is paramount to having success with people analytics. Michael always provides superb summaries of the key takeaways from conferences, and this is one of his best yet. Features insights and case study examples from speakers including: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/greigaitken/"" target=""_blank"">Greig Aitken</a> (RBS), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/elaine-mahon-49167645/"" target=""_blank"">Elaine Mahon</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-saunders/"" target=""_blank"">Kim Saunders</a> (both Office of National Statistics), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/communitymike/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Collins</a> (River Island), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a>. For more on the key takeaways from this conference you should also checkout <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-houghton-06279b77/"" target=""_blank"">Edward Houghton</a>’s write-up <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coming-from-cold-moving-people-analytics-niche-core-hr-houghton/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>, <p>As interest in and adoption of people analytics continues to rise, so the number of students choosing to research the field grows. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulvanderlaken/"" target=""_blank"">Paul van der Laken</a>’s dissertation is one such example and is based in part, on the time Paul spent at Shell where he helped quantify the impact of global mobility as an analyst in the HR Data &amp; Analytics department. The whole dissertation is worth a read, but <a href=""https://www.publicatie-online.nl/uploaded/flipbook/15810-v-d-laken/8/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">chapter 1</a> and <a href=""https://www.publicatie-online.nl/uploaded/flipbook/15810-v-d-laken/144/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">chapter 7</a> are especially recommended. This is where Paul reflects on the past and future of people analytics, discussing machine learning complications, ethical issues, CSR, new avenues, and many more. One of my favourite sections is where Paul outlines his analysis on the monthly Google search interest for several labels describing the field between 2004 and 2018 (see <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: Monthly Google search interest on “people analytics” and related terms over time. Values are proportional to the maximum value and fit by locally weighted regression lines (Source: Paul van der Laken) </em></strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Unilever is one of the companies leading the way when it comes to incorporating AI into HR. In this piece, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardmarr/"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Marr</a> describes how Unilever has partnered with Pymetrics to screen and assess 1.8m job applicants per year. As well as enhancing the candidate experience, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/nairleena/"" target=""_blank"">Leena Nair</a> (Unilever’s CHRO) confirms that the automated system has saved 70,000 hours previously spent on interviewing and assessing candidates. The article also describes Unabot, a NLP based bot that supports onboarding by providing information to employees when asked and which has already been successfully rolled out in 36 of Unilever’s 190 markets.</p>, <p>Taking the recent story about Amazon’s experience with a <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">sexist recruiting engine</a> as his cue, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjcook/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Cook</a> provides three tips on how to use AI to neutralise – rather than perpetuate – bias to support your diversity and recruiting goals. His first tip on pointing the technology at the specific parts of the recruiting process where you are falling short of your diversity goals makes a whole lot of sense. Ian’s overarching message of how AI should serve, not rule, human decision-making is one I fully concur with.</p>, <p>With technology continuing to outpace regulation, companies forging ahead with AI must establish their own ethical frameworks. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenporttom/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Davenport</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-vic-katyal-482166/"" target=""_blank"">Vivek Katyal</a>’s article provides a set of recommendations including making ethics a board-level issue, taking a proactive approach to minimising bias, being transparent with customers and employees and recognising that AI works best with - rather than without – humans. Ethics will continue to be one of the most important and challenging aspects of people analytics, and it’s worth highlighting that the approach of establishing an ethical framework is one <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Insight222</a> has already undertaken with member companies in its People Analytics Program, as described by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkpetersen1/"" target=""_blank"">Dirk Petersen</a> in <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/11/19/six-steps-to-ethically-sound-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">6 steps to ethically sound people analytics</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It’s prediction season so I thought it would be helpful to collect some of the data-themed prophecies. First up, my ten predictions all related to and stress the importance of the ‘Human Touch’. Then Tom Haak provides an inspiring set of trends for 2019, which as he admits makes him as much of a ‘trendwisher’ as a ‘trendwatcher’. I also enjoyed Rob Scott’s list of predictions as well as Kathi Enderes’ prediction that people analytics will augment the workforce and workplace. Bernard Marr makes his second entry on this month’s list with five predictions on where AI is headed in 2019 with #4 “<em>More jobs will be created by AI than will be lost to it</em>” resonating with the earlier article from Ravin Jesuthasan and John Boudreau. Finally, Anita Lettink has performed the monumental task of collecting all of the best HR predictions and trends into one easily digestible repository.</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen/"" target=""_blank"">Patrick</a> has been an inspiration to many in our field with his once or twice a year articles centred around the evolution of people analytics and fact-based HR at ABN Amro. One of his most popular articles is Patrick’s 10 Golden Rules, which he first published in 2014, updated in 2015 and then created this ‘crowd’ version in 2016. All of the rules Patrick outlines resonate, but rules #2 (only do business relevant research), #3 (create actionable insights) and #7 (preach and teach to the HR community) are especially important.   </p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>Two must-listen to podcasts to close the year. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-pfeffer-57a01b6/"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Pfeffer</a> talks to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobsutton1/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Sutton</a> on the FRICTION Podcast about his superb book ‘Dying for a Paycheck,’ and issues a clarion call that rather than increasing working hours in an attempt to drive productivity growth, firms should instead give employees more autonomy. The second podcast this month features <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/slupushor/"" target=""_blank"">Stela Lupushor</a> in conversation with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsumser/"" target=""_blank"">John Sumser</a>. Stela’s background in people analytics, her current role advising firms about inclusion and the work she does to extend the work horizon for women, makes this a rewarding listen.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing the ethics theme from Tom Davenport and Vivek Katyal’s earlier article, Ben Waber speaks to Ian Bailie in this video on how to manage data privacy when collecting activity data on employees, as well as whether “hype” about artificial intelligence justified.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This version of the countdown features a selection of the full set of articles for December, which you can find if you <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/12/20/the-best-hr-amp-people-analytics-articles-of-december-2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">head over to myHRfuture</a>. There you can find additional articles by Keith McNulty, Jocelyne Helbling, an interview by me with Andrew Marritt on text analytics, Cassie Kozyrkov and a collaboration by Paul Daugherty, H.

David R. Green,The best HR & People Analytics articles: Summer 2018,2018,Qtr3,Sep,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-summer-2018-david-green/,"[<p>It's been a long hot summer in Europe and North America - and the weather wasn't too shabby when I was in Sydney in August to speak at LinkedIn's Talent Intelligence Experience either!</p>, <p>July and August have also seen a number of excellent articles published on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.</p>, <p>My monthly round-up of the best articles on these themes have moved to a new home - myHRfuture. You can head over there to read: <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/8/7/the-best-hr-people-analytics-articles-of-july-2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The best HR &amp; People Analytics articles of July 2018</a> and <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/9/5/the-best-hr-people-analytics-articles-of-august-2018"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The best HR &amp; People Analytics article of August 2018</a>. A selection of 11 articles featured across these two retrospectives is provided here.</p>, <p>myHRfuture is also home to my new course 'An Introduction to People Analytics', which I put together with Jonathan Ferrar. Click on <a href=""https://academy.myhrfuture.com/p/introduction-to-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this link</a> or the image below to find out more.</p>, <p>As promised, here is a selection of 11 articles, which caught my attention over the summer:</p>, <p>There’s been a glut of excellent studies this year on the state of the people analytics field, which you can find collated in my recent <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/42fe334aec65/data-driven-hr-newsletter-issue-4-aug-155097"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Data Driven HR Newsletter</a>. Visier’s The Age of People Analytics Report is a valuable addition to the collection. You can download the full report <a href=""https://hello.visier.com/resources_research-reports_age-of-people-analytics.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, but first checkout the main findings in this insightful piece by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin/"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a>, who led the research. The three things Lexy highlights are telling: i) profit margins of organisations with advanced people analytics capability are 56% higher than those of less advanced, ii) building an organisation-wide data-driven culture is critical, and iii) most projects are still focused on HR effectiveness rather than business outcomes. The full report has tons of additional insights, not least the gem that is <strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong> below, which highlights the size of people analytics teams by organisation size and analytics maturity.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 1: SIZE OF PEOPLE ANALYTICS TEAMS BY MATURITY AND ORGANISATION SIZE (SOURCE: VISIER)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the biggest focus areas for HR leaders continues to be the need to understand and improve employee experience. People analytics teams are increasingly at the forefront of efforts to analyse, design and personalise compelling work experiences across the employee lifecycle. As such, the maturity model outlined by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> in this brilliant article (see also <em>Figure 2</em>) will undoubtedly assist many organisations in this effort. Look out for the examples provided on the ‘Moments that Matter’ in the employee journey. This is an approach and model that Volker and his team at <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TI People</a> have created together with over 20 member companies including the likes of BMW, Bosch, Cisco, Roche and Zalando.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 2: A MATURITY MODEL FOR EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE (SOURCE: VOLKER JACOBS, TI PEOPLE)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>When I speak to HR leaders about people analytics one of the most common challenges I hear is that of how to enable the wider HR function and particularly HR business partners. This article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022/"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, which draws on her research at Bersin by Deloitte, covers this critical area and clearly sets out the importance of improving the data literacy of HR professionals. As Madhura describes (and as illustrated in <em>Figure 3</em> below), the companies that develop advanced and sustainable capability in people analytics are those that focus on creating a culture of data-based decision making beyond that of the people analytics team itself.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 3: PERCENTAGE OF ORGANIZATIONS REPORTING BASIC DATA LITERACY SKILLS BY MATURITY LEVEL AND FUNCTION (SOURCE: MADHURA CHAKRABARTI, BERSIN BY DELOITTE)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The HR function is transforming – whether it is the need to become more data driven, be more agile and ultimately increase its impact in the business. This means the HR operating model itself and the skills HR practitioners need to possess both have to adapt to this new reality. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> examines the former in his article with the overriding premise being that upgrades to the HR operating model should focus more on improving relationships within and outside the department as opposed to redefining roles based on organisation charts. In the second article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> defines design thinking and how it can be applied in the HR space particularly with regards to creating and personalising the employee experience.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/didierelzinga/"" target=""_blank"">Didier Elzinga</a>, CEO of Culture Amp, kindly references my recent <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dont-forget-h-hr-ethics-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Ethics in People Analytics</a> article, as part of his clarion call that the way organisations collect and use data must fundamentally change. Ethics is arguably our biggest challenge and also the most important aspect of people analytics. As Didier writes, our responsibility as people analysts is to help our customers in the business (leaders, managers, employees – and HR) interpret and ethically use the data and insights we're giving them.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This is a beautifully written piece by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a>, one of the foremost people analytics leaders on the planet and who until recently led the people analytics team at Apple. As Amit states at the outset ""<em>people analytics leaders are in the business of change management</em>"". He then proceeds to outline a clear vision on how this can be achieved drawing a clever parallel with his boyhood poem of choice “Where the Mind is Without Fear”.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Another case study, where <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a> describes how one of the world's largest FMCG companies worked with <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a> to harness passive ONA data in order to measure the Social Capital of the participants of its leadership development program. The results Greg outlines are significant, not least that as a direct result there was a 40% improvement in the collaboration of the teams whose leaders were involved in the program. ONA continues to be a huge area of interest for people analytics team and this case study offers a practical example of the unique insights and outcomes ONA can provide.  </p>, <p><em>FIGURE 4: TOP LEADERS ARE CENTRAL TO THEIR TEAM'S NETWORK (SOURCE: GREG NEWMAN, TRUSTSPHERE)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> writes, most large organisations have vast amounts of employee text feedback that thus far they’ve done very little with (<em>Figure 5</em> below provides some examples of the types of questions that can be answered with open-question employee text feedback). Given that this data is invariably the most valuable part of a questionnaire or survey, it is not surprising that many people analytics teams are looking to explore these potential gold mines. Andrew is one of the leading proponents of text analytics and this article describes how to code or categorise employee feedback. The section on the difference between deductive and inductive coding is particularly illuminating even for this lay writer. For those that haven’t already subscribed to Andrew’s weekly <a href=""http://www.empiricalhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empirical HR newsletter</a>, I strongly recommend you do.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 5: EXAMPLES OF QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ANSWERED WITH EMPLOYEE TEXT FEEDBACK (SOURCE: ANDREW MARRITT)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this terrific four-part series for HR Zone – the first three articles of which have already been published, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a> outlines his model of Scientific People Analytics (SPA), and the many benefits it brings to businesses. Part 1 provides the rationale behind the methodology. Part 2 explains why SPA is useful for supporting human capital decisions made by organisational managers, and Part 3 presents a methodology for deploying scientific people analytics – see <em>Figure 6</em> below.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 6: METHODOLOGY FOR DEPLOYING SCIENTIFIC PEOPLE ANALYTICS (SOURCE: MAX BLUMBERG)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Case studies help bring analytics to life and this article provides a perfect example. It describes how LinkedIn’s People Analytics team supported the business in formulating a geolocation strategy for its tech talent. Key insights covered include i) the cross-functional approach that was adopted and which saw the team work in tandem with the HRBP for Engineering, Head of Talent Acquisition and Head of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, ii) the focus on the 'why' and building a framework to support the 'why' and; iii) the emphasis on identifying and then answering the critical four questions that were identified for the initiative in <strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong> below.</p>, <p><em>FIGURE 7: GTO TALENT INSIGHTS GEOLOCATION STRATEGY FRAMEWORK (SOURCE: SHUJAAT AHMAD, KATIE SITTLER, LINKEDIN) </em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>People Analytics is increasingly being used to understand how teams work, collaborate, perform and thrive. August saw a glut of excellent articles centred on ‘teams’. The first article from McKinsey examines how to enable small independent teams, which according to the authors are the lifeblood of a truly agile organisation (see <em>Figure 8</em>). The second article outlines five ways to harness technology to improve communication and collaboration within virtual teams. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisonmoser/"" target=""_blank"">Allison Moser</a> provides examples of how eBay, Buzzfeed and Etsy have improved the gender diversity of their teams. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferdawson1/"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Robertson</a> interviews leading team coach <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-clutterbuck-84aa6b/"" target=""_blank"">David Clutterbuck</a> on the role he sees AI playing in team coaching.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 8</em></strong><em>: HOW TO ENABLE SMALL TEAMS IN AN AGILE COMPANY (SOURCE: MCKINSEY)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If Bob Dylan wrote a song about the 21st Century workplace, he may well title it “The Skills They Are A Changin’”, and even that wouldn’t do justice to the shift taking place in our midst. These four articles provide evidence of this. First Culture Amp’s Chief Scientist <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/39748903jkljdl/"" target=""_blank"">Jason McPherson</a>, outlines the four techniques that every people scientist needs to know. Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsschmidt/"" target=""_blank"">Lars Schmidt</a>highlights four skills that emerged from the recent HR Open Source survey that HR leaders of the future will need (and yes, business and data acumen is one of them). Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> describes the importance of political skill and its relationship with network centrality. Finally, some fascinating research from BCG presents the five areas (see <strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong>) that make up the algorithm of the ideal 21st Century CEO.  </p>, <p><strong><em>FIGURE 9:</em></strong><em> A SUCCESS ALGORITHM FOR THE 21ST CENTURY CEO (SOURCE: BCG)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Many of the challenges facing people analytics are outlined in the articles I’ve selected this month. Therefore, it seems apt that my choice as video of the month features six people analytics leaders describing these and other challenges facing the space.

David R. Green,The best HR and People Analytics articles of April 2019,2019,Qtr2,May,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-april-2019-david-green/,"[<p>The term ‘Golden Age’ was first popularised in Ancient Greece and is defined as a period in a field of endeavour when great tasks were accomplished. As Amit Mohindra writes in the article of the month, this can certainly be applied to the field of quantum physics in the first 30 years of the 20th Century. Like Amit, I wonder whether history will come to recognise that we are currently in the midst of a similar halcyon period for people analytics.</p>, <p>Certainly, my experiences in April auger well and confirm that the field of people analytics continues to gather momentum, is broadening and deepening its scope and is increasing its impact both in terms of business outcomes and employee experience. This was evident in the Wharton People Analytics (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflections-wharton-people-analytics-conference-2019-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">see key reflections</a>) and <a href=""https://pafow.com/london19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW London</a> (see a selection of takeaways from Michael Carty [<a href=""https://www.xperthr.com/people-analytics/2019/04/30/strategic-people-analytics-in-action/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>], Pauli Dahlbom [<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-future-work-london-day-1-summary-pauli-dahlbom/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>] and Hans Donckers [<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-challenges-future-people-analytics-hans-donckers/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>]) conferences that bookended April. It can also be seen throughout the 2019 Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends report, which was launched in the middle of April.</p>, <p>Before we dive into the articles selected this month, I’ve got a small favour to ask of readers. As the trailer below explains, I’m launching the Digital HR Leaders Podcast on myHRfuture on 14th May. In each episode, I’ll be speaking to a senior HR leader who is driving transformation in their organisations, as well as other acknowledged experts in the field on how HR can prepare for the future and what HR leaders need to do to prepare for the Future of Work.</p>, <p>The small favour I’d ask of readers is i) to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFgEZIXtLik"" target=""_blank"">watch the trailer</a>, then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coming-soon-digital-hr-leaders-podcast-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">read the article</a> and <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/subscribe"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">subscribe to the podcast</a>, ii) <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coming-soon-digital-hr-leaders-podcast-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">share the article</a> with your friends and colleagues. As ever, your support is much appreciated.</p>, <p>Now on with the countdown for April…</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A fascinating and educational piece as ever from the cerebral <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a> in which he ponders whether the emergence of people analytics in the first 20 years of the current century can be compared to the rise of quantum physics in the first 30 years of the 20th Century. It’s a tantalising thought especially as 17 of the 29 people featured in the photo below from the fifth Solvay Conference (a regular gathering of physicists and chemists to collaborate and share – rather like PAFOW or the Wharton People Analytics Conference?) in 1927 went on to win Nobel Prizes. Will we see a similar flood of winners from the people analytics field? Only time will tell…</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>112 pages organised into three main sections dealing with the Future of the Workforce, the Future of the Organisation and the Future of HR and with essays on each of the ten trends identified for 2019. The Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends for 2019 is the usual absorbing read. For those working in the people analytics space, the discipline is not called out individually as one of the ten trends – it was joint #1 last year. I see this as a sign that the field has matured as data and analytics is central to most if not all of the ten trends identified for 2019. The whole report is worth a read, but the essays on ‘From employee experience to human experience: Putting meaning back into work’, ‘Organisational performance: It’s a team sport’ and ‘Learning in the flow of life’ are especially essential.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: </em></strong><em>When experience is bottom-up and personal, it becomes focused on “human experience” (Source: Deloitte Analysis)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It’s become almost cliché to say the toughest challenge in any digital transformation isn’t the technology — it’s the people. The underlying assumption is that most employees don’t understand what’s coming and are resistant to change. That myth is busted in a fascinating new study of 6,500 business leaders and 11.000 workers, which suggests leaders are seriously underestimating their people. The study finds workers are ""<em>much more eager to embrace change and learn new skills than their employers gave them credit for</em>.” The article goes on to describe how employers can better help their workforce with two recommendations really resonating: i) Create a learning culture, and ii) Engage the workforce in the transition instead of herding them into it.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: </em></strong><em>Six forces shaping the future of work (Source: Created from Fuller et al, Harvard Business Review)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A terrific read from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-boudreau-115500/"" target=""_blank"">John Boudreau</a> in which he espouses the need for HR to play an active role in the dilemmas arising from the potential impact of AI (“should AI be built to predict an outcome or mimic human behaviour?”). As Boudreau explains, the latter will often be faster, cheaper and more tempting, but may obscure important values, tradeoffs, and biases. He goes on to advocate that AI gives HR an opportunity to understand these dilemmas, articulate the tradeoffs and lead – not just when it comes to using AI in HR but throughout the organisation.  </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> describes, work is increasingly not just accomplished by full-time, part-time, or contracted workers, but also through automation and technology. This forms the basis of his article, which presents his methodology (see <strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong>) for a shift in thinking from workforce to worktask planning. This entails routine and standard tasks being allocated to technology and automation with people being assigned strategic, creative and unique responsibilities. This shift means HR professionals and people analytics teams need to broaden their horizon from a sole focus on full- and part- time employees to incorporate contractors, technology and automation too. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: </em></strong><em>A model for Worktask Planning (Source: Dave Ulrich)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> outlines a common challenge that is frequently experienced by People Analytics leaders - identifying value in People Analytics Projects. Leveraging the <a href=""https://www.insight222.com/nine-dimensions"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nine Dimensions in People Analytics Model</a> Jonathan and I co-created to help clients navigate this challenge led us to identify seven questions that People Analytics leaders should be asking themselves to ensure they’re on the right path to success. These questions cover areas such as leadership, ethics, governance and the levels of data literacy amongst HR business partners. The article also provides access to <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/survey"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a short survey that will help you identify your current level of excellence in People Analytics</a>. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4</em></strong><em>: The recommended composition for a ‘Board for People Analytics,’ which increases awareness of and provides direction for people analytics (Source: Jonathan Ferrar)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A fascinating read about how the HR team plays a pivotal role in keeping Amazon’s fabled Day 1 culture alive, which Jeff Bezos believes is crucial in enabling the company to continue to innovate and remain customer focused. The article covers Amazon’s agile ‘two-pizza’ team design, Single-Threaded Owner (STO) methodology, use of ONA to evaluate team structures (see example in <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>), practices to enable adaptive space and much more. This article comes from <a href=""https://www.hrps.org/resources/people-strategy-journal/Spring2019/Pages/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">SHRM’s spring 2019 People + Strategy magazine</a>, which is devoted to articles on ONA and advancing adaptive space. I highly recommend getting hold of a copy and enjoying other articles from the likes of Michael Arena, Mary Uhl-Bien, Rob Cross, Anna Tavis, Kristin Supancich, John Healy and Debra R. France. It’s an absolute treasure trove of insights. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>Execution Network and reasons for slow decision-making (Source: Galeti et al, SHRM People + Strategy Journal, Spring 2019)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a> shares with me his two-year journey of scaling people analytics at Capital One including insights on i) how he grew the team from 25 to 75 people, ii) how and why he developed a Centre of Excellence (see <strong><em>FIG 6)</em></strong>, iii) his philosophy on hiring and developing the team, iv) the dual focus on creating business impact as well as supporting employee experience and career development, v) his key responsibilities as leader plus his views on enablers of success. Guru has built one of the leading people analytics functions on the planet, so there is plenty to learn from here.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 6: </em></strong><em>Reasons to create a Centre of Excellence for People Analytics (Source: Guru Sethupathy)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This article documents the findings of a fascinating study by Google’s People Analytics team to understand the impact of distributed work on teams in areas such as well-being, performance and connectedness, before providing some recommendations to keep those things consistent.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The May-June edition of Harvard Business Review contains a trio of excellent articles on the state of recruiting in the wake of the use of social media, technology and algorithms. Two of these articles are by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-cappelli-14936a3/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Cappelli</a> and simply have to be read. In the first article, Cappelli eschews the trend for “passive” candidates highlighting that there’s no evidence to suggest these candidates perform better, that the approach marginalises talented internal candidates, costs more and is largely unproven. In the second article, Cappelli is similarly scornful about the risks of using predictive algorithms for hiring. A sobering but important read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> writes in his latest appraisal of the dynamics affecting the market, the evolution of employee engagement continues to gather pace. He reminisces that it was only ten years ago that over 60% of companies didn’t survey their employees at all, and those that did only did it once a year. Now, a large number of companies have created the ability for workers to provide continuous feedback and the emphasis has shifted towards taking action – invariably via managers - as Josh outlines in <strong><em>FIG 7</em></strong> below. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 7: </em></strong><em>Process for taking action on insights from engagement feedback (Source: Josh Bersin)</em> </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock/"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a> paints a familiar picture of counterproductive employee engagement surveys including failure to measure what matters, analysis paralysis and no action on issues workers care most about. Fortunately, things don’t have to be this way and Bock outlines four steps companies can take to ensure efforts to solicit employee feedback don’t come back to haunt them.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As Culture Amp CEO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/didierelzinga/"" target=""_blank"">Didier Elzinga</a> writes in this insightful piece, CEOs are increasingly seeking competitive advantage through the ability of their organisation to take people and grow them faster and better than anybody else – and they’re turning to their CHROs to achieve this. The five questions Didier outlines that CEOs should ask their CHROs cover areas including: inclusion, engagement, leadership capability and employee experience at key touchpoints. A mandatory read for any current or aspiring CHRO.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’ve always enjoyed <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg/"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>’s articles as not only do they tackle interesting and important topics in people analytics, but they are invariably also rather provocative. That’s certainly the case with Max’s latest piece penned together with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-holdstock-09204239/"" target=""_blank"">James Holdstock</a>, which presents the case against the use of flight risk models because the authors feel they are creepy and open to abuse by employers. Whilst the scene painted here is contrary to what I’ve seen from the organisations I’ve worked with it is relatively certain that people analytics will at some point experience its own ‘Cambridge Analytica’ moment.  As such, as a community we must continue to put ethics and people analytics for good at the forefront remembering it’s not enough to just decide whether a model is ethical, but also how it is going to be used and applied. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Nudge theory dictates that the best way to drive change in a complex organisation is through a series of small incremental changes, which will consequently deliver significant and substantial business results. The theory was popularised by Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler, who stole the show at the recent Wharton People Analytics Conference in Philadelphia. In tribute to Professor Thaler, I’ve collected four recent articles highlighting the growth of nudges and behavioural economics in the workplace. Much of the attention in this area is focused on the work <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock/"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a> is doing with his new company Humu, and his interview with Yale describes how behavioural science, combined with an understanding of human feeling and careful attention to privacy, can help organisations run better. The second article comes from Humu’s <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanie-m-tignor-056a10104/"" target=""_blank"">Stephanie Tignor</a> and is adapted from her enthralling presentation at Wharton PAC (see also <strong><em>FIG 8</em></strong>). Next, an excellent long read in People Management really captures the essence of how nudge theory can help persuade people to change behaviour.  Finally, McKinsey outlines six areas to consider before setting up a nudge unit with two covering how to demonstrate impact and the critical topic of ethics.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8: </em></strong><em>Having a bad manager can actually make you more likely to stay at your job (Source: Stephanie Tignor)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As the Wharton PAC and PAFOW conferences both demonstrated, the rise of data-driven diversity and inclusion continues to gather pace. This is a good thing as people analytics has the potential to finally unlock the business value of D&amp;I. These four articles provide further evidence. First, Turban et al outline their fascinating research, which found that beliefs about gender diversity create a self-fulfilling cycle. Countries and industries that view gender diversity as important capture benefits from it. Those that don’t, don’t. In the second article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryyoung4/"" target=""_blank"">Mary Young</a> explores how firms are increasingly combining traditional HR data and performance metrics with previously untapped data sources to measure inclusion and track its progress over time. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drtomaschamorro/"" target=""_blank"">Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic</a> outlines three factors that make some leaders more committed to diversity than others. Finally, Peakon’s excellent new Heartbeat series delves into data from 60,000 employees under 3,000 managers, across 43 countries to answer the tantalising question: <em>How do female-led companies differ from male-led companies?</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’ve been doing a lot of research on podcasts in readiness for the launch of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coming-soon-digital-hr-leaders-podcast-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Digital HR Leaders</a> on 14th May. The absolute masters of this genre from a HR themed perspective are <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattalder/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Alder</a>. I could have picked any episode of Adam’s mesmerising Worklife podcast but really enjoyed his take on playing to your strengths – at the right time. Matt Alder has overseen over 180 episodes of his consistently excellent Recruiting Future Podcast. The pick from April has to be this deep dive into the world of recruiting automation. I can also recommend <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsschmidt/"" target=""_blank"">Lars Schmidt</a>’s excellent new 21st Century HR Podcast, with this episode seeing him reunited with his HR Open Source sparring partner <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambrosiavertesi/"" target=""_blank"">Ambrosia Vertesi</a> for insights on how she scaled people teams and infrastructure at Hootsuite and Duo Security.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Jason Averbook is one of the most knowledgeable, lively and most interesting speakers on the circuit, so this video of his masterclass at the recent People Matters Tech HR conference in Singapore on how HR leaders can build a holistic digital experience is definitely worth a watch.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It’s perhaps a good sign that the growth in people analytics has finally seen the addition of ‘People Analytics for Dummies’ to the long-running series of similarly titled how-to guides. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcwest/"" target=""_blank"">Mike West</a>, the author, is a seriously good egg and has been in the people analytics space longer than most. He has helped large and small companies alike in setting up successful people analytics functions, so has a lot of knowledge to impart. As such this book is a good starting point for anyone ready to dip into the deep end of people analytics. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>For the third consecutive year, I made the pilgrimage to Philadelphia for the Wharton People Analytics Conference. The conference deserves its lofty reputation, and despite the high bar set in 2017 and 2018, this year’s event was the best yet. My reflections on the two days feature the likes of Richard Thaler, Allyson Felix, Marcus Buckingham and Deloitte's CEO Cathy Engelbert along with the Wharton team of Adam Grant, Cade Massey and Laura Zarrow. The topics covered in Philadelphia were diverse with three themes coming to the fore: Diversity and Inclusion, Organisational Network Analysis and Nudges. I strongly recommend that everyone working in or interested in people analytics should try and get along to Wharton PAC at least once in their careers.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’d also like to offer a big thank you to HRE and the HR Technology Conference team for including me in their inaugural <a href=""http://hrexecutive.com/top-100/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>Top 100 HRTech Influencers</strong></a><strong> </strong>list, which was announced last week. I should say that I'm typically not a huge fan of lists like these as they can be a bit arbitrary and subjective - for example my list of favourite albums (e.g. Low, The Stone Roses [30 years old last week], This Is Big Audio Dynamite [see below], London Calling etc) is likely to be completely different to most others.</p>, <p>However, this list is a pretty solid one and features genuine giants of our industry like Josh Bersin, Adam Grant, Dave Ulrich, Diane Gherson, Jason Averbook and Laszlo Bock. The list is a real feather in the cap for Insight222 and myHRfuture too as it features three of our team – Jonathan Ferrar and Al Adamsen as well as me. <a href=""http://hrexecutive.com/top-100/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>You can check out the full list here</strong></a>.</p>, <p>I’ll be chairing and/or speaking about people analytics, data-driven HR and the <em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</em> model at the following events until the end of October 2019. </p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>David is a globally respected writer, speaker, conference chair, and executive consultant on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.

It is also evidenced in the innovation being brought into the space from the vendor community, which witnessed more consolidation with the news last week that Culture Amp had acquired continuous performance management company Zugata (read <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Garr</a>’s article on the acquisition <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/smart-first-buy-culture-amp-acquires-zugata-stacia-sherman-garr/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p>, <p>The continued health and innovation in the field is also demonstrated in the quality and diversity of articles I’ve selected for this month’s collection. This proved to be one of the hardest selections yet as the longlist extended to 30 articles, all of which that would have been a shoo-in not so long ago.</p>, <p>The selections cover topics such as market analysis, workforce planning, organisational network analysis, diversity and inclusion, leadership and culture, creating a data-driven culture within HR and a number of hugely insightful articles by people analytics leaders.

There are a multitude of insights offered throughout the 68 pages not least that the if companies create trust – and therefore unlock the value of workforce data – the growth for the 6,000 largest publicly listed global companies alone equates to more than US$3 trillion. The study nimbly balances insights from business leaders (e.g. 77% of business leaders say that new sources of workforce data will grow the business) and workers (e.g. 92% are open to the collection of data providing it improves their performance or wellbeing or provides other benefits). Having demonstrated the criticality of trust, the study then provides guidance on how to elevate people using technology, share responsibility and benefits, as well as maximise the value to employers – and people – of workforce data.

The headline prediction is that AI, productivity, and focus on the Employee Experience will drive technology investments in the year ahead. From a data driven HR perspective, and as Josh outlined in his keynote at PAFOW, people analytics is a key foundation of the 11 predictions outlined as the focus shifts towards productivity, performance and teams (see <strong><em>Fig 1</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong><em>: From HCM to Talent Management to HR in the Flow of Work (Source: Josh Bersin)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This Perspective on the state of people analytics in 2019 was compiled by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annatavis/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Tavis</a> for the winter edition of SHRM’s People + Strategy Journal. I was delighted to contribute the lead article, which looks at the growth in the field, provides examples of how Nielsen, Virgin Media and Clarks have used analytics to help drive business outcomes, and introduces the Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics model (see <strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong>) Jonathan Ferrar and I co-created in 2018. The other articles from a stellar list of contributors provide a counterpoint to my article and collectively show both the rising importance of people analytics, but also how the field is both broadening and deepening.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong><em>: Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics (Source: Jonathan Ferrar and David Green)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Creating a culture of data-based decision making is key to achieving sustainable success with people analytics.

In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin/"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a> outlines research she conducted as part of Visier’s The Age of People Analytics study, which found that the vast majority of HRBPs are still not comfortable when it comes to using data. Indeed, a key obstacle to success of people analytics identified by the study was “<em>we do not have a ‘data-driven’ skillset within HR and / or our HR business partners</em>.” Lexy then outlines a number of recommendations both for HRBPs themselves and organisations to support, track and measure improvement including <strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong>, which highlights the key capabilities that HRBPs need to be most effective as promoters of people analytics usage.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong><em>: Key capabilities HRBPs need to be most effective as promoters of people analytics usage (Source: Visier)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As I wrote at #10 of my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/human-touch-10-predictions-hr-2019-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">HR predictions for 2019</a>, the skills and knowledge areas required by HR professionals is undergoing a significant revolution. In this excellent summary, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveweisbeck/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Weisbeck</a> describes four essential skills that are increasingly being required: i) connecting HR Decisions to Business Outcomes, ii) data-based reasoning and innovation, iii) social intelligence, and iv) creative problem solving. These fit in nicely with the six knowledge areas where we are building out online training with the <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/academy/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">myHRfuture academy</a> (see <strong><em>FIG 4</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: </em></strong><em>Six knowledge areas for HR to focus on to prepare for the future of work (Source: myHRfuture)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Inspired by his search for a new CFO, Concentra CEO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rupertmorrison/"" target=""_blank"">Rupert Morrison</a> describes his ‘eureka’ moment where he realised that HR could take a leaf out of Finance’s book by restructuring itself into two distinct parts: HR operations, and Organisational planning and analysis (OP&amp;A) (see <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>). Rupert goes on to outline some of the key business questions OP&amp;A would answer (e.g. How should the organisation be redesigned to better deliver the business strategy, Who does what work, who should do it, and what new skills are required) as well as detailing five steps for HR to be future ready.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>As FP&amp;A is to Finance, so OP&amp;A is to HR (Source: Rupert Morrison)</em></p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>This article from McKinsey presents how by looking at their supply of skills and talent in a new light today, organisations can take actions that better prepare their companies for tomorrow’s challenges.

First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/guru-sethupathy-1408741/"" target=""_blank"">Guru Sethupathy</a> describes the three broad areas of impact his team at Capital One are focused on: influencing talent strategy and policy, empowering better decision making and empowering the workforce to be their best – watch out for an upcoming article I am collaborating with Guru on. Like Guru, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> has been building his people analytics team (at McKinsey) for two years. His article outlines the six-step methodology (see <strong><em>FIG 7</em></strong>), he has evolved to support decision making and increase business impact. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferreras/"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Ferreras</a>, who leads people analytics at Nordstorm, uses a powerful example to warn of the danger of going down the rabbit hole of ‘best practice’ when comparing your own organisation against industry benchmarks and published research and case studies.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 7: </em></strong><em>The Analytics lifecycle (Source: Keith McNulty)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A tongue-in-cheek but painfully accurate list of 20 steps companies typically adopt to undermine and diminish the impact of advanced analytics teams.

Her research was the foundation of the famous <a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Project Aristotle</a> study Google’s People Analytics team published a few years ago. In this excerpt from her new book, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Organization-Psychological-Workplace-Innovation/dp/1119477247"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Fearless Organization</a>, Amy describes three steps leaders can take to create psychological safety (see also <strong><em>FIG 8</em></strong>), the prerequisite for greater innovation and growth. Read alongside <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamishmore/"" target=""_blank"">Hamish More</a>’s terrific article on why an environment of psychological safety is required to successfully hire for team-fit and diversity.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8</em></strong><em>: The Leader’s Tool Kit for Building Psychological Safety (Source: Amy Edmondson, The Fearless Organization)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Organisational Network Analysis (ONA) continues to rise in importance as more companies adopt both the active and passive forms of network science to identify insights that drive collaboration, innovation, productivity and performance. This interview with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-arena-21b6164/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Arena</a>, Chief Talent Officer at GM and author of Adaptive Space, provides an illuminating insight into the opportunity for companies embracing ONA when it comes to organisational design.</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>One of the most powerful uses cases for ONA/People Analytics is in the domain of sales effectiveness. This case study describes how Microsoft combined passive ONA (calendar and email metadata) with organisational, CRM and sales outcome data to analyse the impact of a major sales transformation involving 20,000 people and over 100 countries. The analysis provided insights around critical areas such as internal and customer collaboration, ramp up of new hires, time spent with customers and impact on the business success of customers.</p>, <p><strong> </strong></p>, <p>As this comprehensive report from BCG outlines, it is perplexing that with the level of effort companies have put into diversity that progress continues to be slow. Although most organisations now have diversity programs in place, the report finds that only 25% of employees in diverse groups feel that they have benefited. The report covers diversity in gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation as well as identifying specific solutions that can be implemented to accelerate progress. Diversity and inclusion is increasingly a focus for people analytics teams, so it is to be hoped that reports like these allied to a more data-driven approach will yield faster progress in this critical area sooner rather than later.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 9: </em></strong><em>The most effective Diversity initiatives (Source: BCG)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The Employee Engagement market continues to be subject to considerable disruption with Culture Amp’s acquisition of Zugata following hot on the heels of LinkedIn buying Glint and Qualtrics being snapped up by SAP. These articles collectively signify the change that is occurring.

This includes the insight that the share of 5 star Glassdoor ratings is now 28% of total ratings (see <strong><em>FIG 10</em></strong>). Then <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkverburg/"" target=""_blank"">Dirk Verburg</a> reminds us of the study by Harter et al, which found the significant impact of engagement on a myriad of business performance indicators. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpeoplegeek/"" target=""_blank"">Jason McPherson</a> examines the validity of the ‘best friend at work’ question, before Culture Amp colleague <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thestevenhuang/"" target=""_blank"">Steven Huang</a> outlines five D&amp;I questions you can include within your survey. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/edans/"" target=""_blank"">Enrique Dans</a> looks at the emergence of Laszlo Bock’s Humu and the pros and cons of algorithmic based nudges that make personalised recommendations to workers on behaviours and how they work.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 10: </em></strong><em>Share of Glassdoor ratings by stars 2013-18 (Source: Wall Street Journal)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The article that arguably started it all and undoubtedly the one that brought people analytics to the attention of a wider audience – and certainly me – when it was published in 2010.

David R. Green,The best HR and People Analytics articles of February 2019,2019,Qtr1,Mar,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-february-2019-david-green/,"[<p>It may be the most diminutive month, but there certainly wasn’t a dearth of people analytics and data-driven HR themed articles in February. Indeed, whittling down the articles to the final list this month has proved an intensely gruelling task.</p>, <p>February started for me in San Francisco with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/four-strategic-imperatives-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">the biggest and most successful People Analytics &amp; Future of Work Conference yet</a>, which I co-chaired with Al Adamsen. Next stop was Birmingham for the <a href=""https://www.hrdsummit.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRD Summit</a>, where I spoke and also co-ran a workshop with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> on our <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/blog/2018/8/9/nine-dimensions-for-excellence-in-people-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics model</a>.</p>, <p>Finally, I’ve just returned from Dubai, where I chaired <a href=""https://www.shrmtech.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the inaugural SHRM Tech EMEA conference</a> – the personal highlight being the panel on the future of work I moderated with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/denaalmansoori/"" target=""_blank"">Dena Almansoori</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-levy-b695201/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Levy</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonaverbook/"" target=""_blank"">Jason Averbook</a>.</p>, <p>Gauging <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHtTJ7aBjTc"" target=""_blank"">the sound of the crowd</a> from all three shows was the recognition that HR simply has to evolve. Where data is concerned, this means embracing people analytics to help enable better business decisions, drive improvements to the workforce experience and consequently increase HR’s own impact. The articles selected this month are all designed to help support this theme.</p>, <p>  </p>, <p>Just as <a href=""https://www.organizationview.com/insights-articles/2018/5/25/sometimes-the-best-solutions-arent-the-most-sophisticated"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">people analytics doesn’t need to be sophisticated to unlock value</a>, nor do findings necessarily need to be a great leap forward to be useful. Indeed, as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a> writes in this excellent piece for MIT SMR, quantifying obvious insights through people analytics can help gain trust and overcome three obstacles to change. These are: resistance to data (“But that’s not what my experience has shown”), resistance to change (“But that’s the way we’ve always done it”) and organisational uniqueness bias (“That will never work here”).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article, which previews his white paper collaboration with ServiceNow of the same name, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> describes the emergence of the Employee Experience Platform (EXP). He defines an EXP as a user-centric software layer that gives workers a single point of access for a range of services, thus shielding them from heterogeneous back-end systems. When implemented well, Josh suggests that the EXP platform should also enable AI, nudges, mobile apps, and cognitive interfaces to help drive personalisation, productivity and engagement.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1: </em></strong><em>Employee journeys cross functional areas and systems (Source: Josh Bersin)</em> </p>, <p>  </p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianbailie/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Bailie</a> builds on Josh’s article, some of the other latest thinking on Employee Experience and his own experience designing EX programs at Cisco, advocating that HR should aim higher than just service-based excellence and efficiency. Instead, Ian implores HR to design people-centric platforms that create a great experience for the entire workforce (not just employees) that they actually want to use. In what is truly a coruscating piece, Ian also urges that <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/the-business-value-of-ex-no-employee-experience-impact-without-the-business"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">EX initiatives need to be linked to business value</a> as well as being focused on fixing the key touch points that matter in the employee journey. Finally, Ian tackles the thorny issue of data ownership, concluding that HR should lead the charge for workers to own their own data, so they can take it with them when they leave and build intrinsic value for managing their careers and promote lifelong employability.</p>, <p>Set a challenge by ING CHRO, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hein-knaapen-a879289/"" target=""_blank"">Hein Knaapen</a>, to explain the business value of Employee Experience (EX), <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/volker-jacobs/"" target=""_blank"">Volker Jacobs</a> pulls it off with aplomb in this terrific article. The model he describes (see <strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong>), shows the ‘What’ of <a href=""https://www.ti-people.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TI-people</a>’s EX methodology on the right-hand side, which he connects to business value in the ‘Why’ part of the model. The two features Volker highlights is how the approach creates i) an engaging experience at ‘moments of truth’, and ii) an effortless experience of HR. He goes on to reveal that one company TI-people is working with has designed their EX initiative around the premise of “<em>Giving 1 million hours back to employees and managers each year</em>”. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: </em></strong><em>The business value of Employee Experience (Source: Volker Jacobs, TI-people)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Giving people their own data to help them learn and develop is one of the conclusions drawn from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebrebele/"" target=""_blank"">Reb Rebele</a>’s excellent analysis on the pros and cons of psychometric tests. Reb describes why personality testing and other ways of analysing potential present significant challenges. He explains that not all assessments pass the sniff test, and people’s personalities vary from moment to moment, often depending on the challenge at hand. Instead, Reb argues, we need a finer-grained understanding of human potential including a better consideration of context and measures designed with variability in mind. Reb’s and Adam Grant’s articles are both taken from a <a href=""https://sloanreview.mit.edu/columns/mit-smr-series-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">MIT SMR series on People Analytics</a>. Check out the other articles by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-duckworth-1289/"" target=""_blank"">Angela Duckworth</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-bidwell-4950061/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Bidwell</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/federica-de-stefano-1962b629/"" target=""_blank"">Federica De Stefano</a> too.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/davenporttom/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Davenport</a> has been referred to as ‘the father of analytics’, so when he writes that HR’s use of advanced analytics is 14% higher than in Finance (see <strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong>), one sits up and takes notice. Tom’s article, <a href=""https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/hr-analytics-report-ipaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">based on research he conducted in unison with Oracle</a>, goes further in presenting evidence that HR is not just employing analytics but also AI in significant and growing numbers. The research uncovered that just over half of HR organisations in the global survey now say they can perform advanced (predictive and prescriptive) analytics, with only 6% of HR respondents admitting they are “novices” at analytics. Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that 31% made AI the first choice of analytics they are using. </p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3: </em></strong><em>Comparison of HR vs. Finance on analytical methodologies used (Source: Oracle - HR Moves Boldly into Advanced Analytics with Collaboration from Finance)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>This in-depth case study describes in detail how IBM reimagined its performance management system (see <strong><em>FIG 4</em></strong>) by co-creating a model with employees that promoted speed, innovation, promoted feedback over assessment and strove to cultivate a high-performance culture. Insights are offered throughout by IBM’s CHRO <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/diane-gherson-1b93b77/"" target=""_blank"">Diane Gherson</a> and VP Global Talent <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/joanna-daly-035b741/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Daly</a> with supporting commentary from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/annatavis/"" target=""_blank"">Anna Tavis</a>. The MIT SMR article also describes how IBM overhauled and personalised learning to reflect that “<em>in today’s world, skills are actually more important than jobs.</em>” This platform uses data to infer which skills employees have and connects them with learning to build those skills that are increasingly in demand. If that wasn’t enough, the case study also outlines how IBM uses people analytics to predict and prevent attrition, as well as how the company has deployed chatbots and virtual assistants to improve the employee experience. A must-read.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: </em></strong><em>﻿The shift in IBM's approach to performance management (Source: MIT SMR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> cuts through the hype and distils what the digital revolution means for HR. He describes a four phased approach to evolve HR into a digital function. These are: i) Efficiency “using technology to streamline administrative and repetitive work”, ii) Innovation (see <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>) “using technology and apps to innovate HR practice”, iii) Information “using technology, data and analytics to support better decision making”, and; iv) Connection “using technology to create connections and enhance the employee experience to drive individual and organisational productivity.”</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>Examples of how HR can improve HR practices with technology applications (Source: Dave Ulrich)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As highlighted earlier, <a href=""https://pafow.com/pafow19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">the PAFOW conference in San Francisco</a> was the biggest and most successful yet in the show’s thirteen-year history, as this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qbYmVj0Q0w"" target=""_blank"">highlights video shows</a>. Over the two days, some of the crème de la crème of the people analytics cognoscenti spoke, which meant I was able to create and organise my key takeaways around <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/four-strategic-imperatives-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">a manifesto of four strategic imperatives</a> for the field. The article features insights from the likes of: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bahubbard/"" target=""_blank"">Brad Hubbard</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor/"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-whiteman-ph-d-02a8097/"" target=""_blank"">Heather Whiteman</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/misael-cerpas-05972686/"" target=""_blank"">Misael Cerpas</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwhite612/"" target=""_blank"">David White</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyushmathur/"" target=""_blank"">Piyush Mathur</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-higgins-5875082/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Higgins</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardrosenow/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Rosenow</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Garr</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/manishgoelts/"" target=""_blank"">Manish Goel</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a>.

See you there!</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 6</em></strong><em>: Four Strategic Imperatives for People Analytics (Source: David Green)</em></p>, <p>I am often asked how to set up and focus people analytics in a small to medium enterprise, and it is true that the vast majority of case studies, articles conference speeches and research focuses on people analytics in large organisations. However, if you look carefully enough there are a several examples of smaller companies having significant success with people analytics. In this revealing piece, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/littal-shemer-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Littal Shemer Haim</a> interviews <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-shoval-ab05b93/"" target=""_blank"">Michal Shoval</a> on her journey at GIA - 'the motives, the obstacles, the quick win, the team participation, and more'.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Three must-read articles for those leading or working in people analytics teams. First the inimitable <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> walks through the first question one should ask before building a model – namely is it intended to be explanatory (""created to help understand why something is happening"") or predictive (""created to make predictions as accurately as possible regarding what will happen""). The second article looks at the critical role of translators in analytics, providing guidance on hiring and developing translators, imbuing translator skills into the wider employee population and growing organisational ability to deliver analytics use cases. The third article, whilst focused on marketing, also highlights the need for a translator as well as seven other steps to take when conducting an experiment. As the authors state, experimentation promises the power of the scientific method to help reduce uncertainty.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Learning to navigate and manage the intense rise of collaborative demands in today’s workplace is, as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/crossrob/"" target=""_blank"">Rob Cross</a> writes in his article, a skill that is necessary to survive and thrive in today’s world. Rob’s article then describes seven habits of highly inefficient collaborators including ‘time vampires’, ‘black holes’, ‘calendar killers’ and ‘fear creators.’ <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjcook/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Cook</a> draws on further research from Rob in his article examining the business impact of collaborative overload such as burnout and ‘turnover contagion.’ Ian then explains how ONA can be deployed in conjunction with people analytics to reduce the risk of burnout by identifying influencers, uncovering turnover trends and quantifying the cost of the problem.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the emerging use cases for ONA is in measuring the effectiveness of diversity and inclusion initiatives through a social capital lens. This is the focus of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/newmangreg/"" target=""_blank"">Greg Newman</a>’s terrific article. Citing research from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/boris-groysberg-31a93a5/"" target=""_blank"">Boris Groysberg</a>, Greg describes how female and male employees tend to build stronger external and internal networks respectively and the impact this has when they move job. Greg also provides insights from some of <a href=""https://www.trustsphere.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TrustSphere</a>’s clients on how networks can affect promotability, trust and collaboration. One example (see <strong><em>FIG 7</em></strong>) includes an organisation where if an employee had more than ten years tenure, they had virtually no strong working relationships with anyone with less than five years tenure. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the negative impact this will likely have on innovation, problem-solving and ultimately business performance.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 7: </em></strong><em>Example of ONA analysis showing the strongest relationships of employees with 10+ years tenure at one company (Source: TrustSphere)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-january-2019-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">Last month’s collection</a> featured a landmark study by Accenture on <a href=""https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/future-workforce/workforce-data-organizational-dna"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">trust, data and unlocking value in the digital workplace</a>. This article looks at how companies can use workplace data in an effective, responsible, and ethical way. The authors present a framework of three key actions responsible leaders can take: i) Give employees more control, ii) Create a system of checks and balances, iii) Use Data to Elevate People, Not Penalise Them. Examples from the likes of Schlumberger, JP Morgan Chase and AXA are provided respectively to highlight each step of the framework. Interestingly and similar to the earlier articles by Ian Bailie and Reb Rebele, the study advocates that people data should be co-owned with employees so they can take it with them when they move jobs.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As technology and workforce expectations evolve along with the shift from roles to skills, lifelong learning has become the expected norm. This has moved the goalposts with regards to learning and development and has prompted a revolution in the space in the shape of the increased use of data, analytics and personalisation. These three articles collectively provide a comprehensive view of this shift. <a href=""http://Josh%20Bersin"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/marczs/"" target=""_blank"">Marc-Zao Sanders</a> describe a new paradigm of ‘learning in the flow of work.’ The second article from McKinsey describe ‘lifelong employability’ and how this allows companies to get ahead of the skills challenge while in parallel making a better workplace for everyone. Finally, the Deloitte article provides an excellent primer on the what, why and how of learning analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulvanderlaken/"" target=""_blank"">Paul van der Laken</a> may well have produced with this list the best curation of books for the forward-thinking data-driven (or data-curious) HR professional in existence. Indeed, it almost deserves a Nobel Prize. Paul was inspired by a post by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredvaldron/"" target=""_blank"">Jared Valdron</a>’s call for book recommendations on people analytics on LinkedIn, which drew nearly 60 responses. Paul decided to merge these overviews and voila, the community now has a monumental resource to draw from. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>With the staggering but yet not surprising revelation from the World Economic Forum that <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/18/global-gender-pay-gap-will-take-202-years-to-close-says-world-economic-forum"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">it will take 202 years to close the global gender pay gap</a>, it seems entirely appropriate to highlight some of the best D&amp;I themed articles that were published in February. First, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/thestevenhuang/"" target=""_blank"">Steven Huang</a> provides a practical step-by-step guide on how to answer the question: “Is there a systematic bias in how Men vs. Women employees are paid?”. Next, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellentaaffe/"" target=""_blank"">Ellen Taaffe</a> provides a number of tips for firms to turn good intentions around inclusion into actions – including studying the data. Then, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisarabasca/"" target=""_blank"">Lisa Rabasca Roepe</a> describes how the difference in how men and women approach networking has a big impact on career opportunities, and outlines six ways how women can better leverage their connections. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/glencathey/"" target=""_blank"">Glen Cathey</a>’s lengthy but fascinating piece provides a compelling argument for neuro diversity based on research showing brain-level variances between introverts and extroverts that result in real differences in how they think, process information, interact with others, and work best. Finally, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Garr</a> outlines the updated RedThread Research and Mercer study into the growth of HR technology companies that service the diversity and inclusion field.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8: </em></strong><em>Problems D&amp;I technology is trying to solve (Source: Red Thread Research and Mercer)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Originally published in 2015, where it featured in my collection of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21-best-hr-analytics-articles-2015-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">the best people analytics articles of 2015</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra/"" target=""_blank"">Amit Mohindra</a> presents his three ‘laws’ of people/workforce analytics in what continues to be both a popular and prescient article: i) The demand for workforce analytics grows exponentially; ii) The consumption of workforce analytics requires effort; iii) Workforce analytics trumps workforce planning – in most circumstances. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Two podcasts I recommend listening to this month are first <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/beneubanks/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Eubanks</a> in conversation with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Garr</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/caroleljackson/"" target=""_blank"">Carole Jackson</a> on the aforementioned Red Thread Research and Mercer study into the burgeoning diversity and inclusion technology field. In the second podcast, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> talks to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-sexton-brown-98831b36/"" target=""_blank"">Emily Sexton-Brown</a> about the current trends in HR, just how damaging technology can be and how the field needs to develop our ideas and current mindset for HR to evolve.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> is my go-to on employee listening and text analytics and in this interview with <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">myHRfuture</a>, he offers a number of great insights on the developments taking place in this space. His thoughts on the usefulness (or otherwise) of sentiment analysis are particularly illuminating.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the run up to SHRM Tech EMEA, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanadielsayyed/"" target=""_blank"">Hanadi El Sayyed</a> interviewed me about trends and challenges in the people analytics field.

David R. Green,The best HR and People Analytics articles of March 2019,2019,Qtr2,Apr,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/best-hr-people-analytics-articles-march-2019-david-green/,"[<p>March was a phenomenally busy yet rewarding month. It started with a meeting of members of <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6512347460072017921/"" target=""_blank"">Insight222’s People Analytics Program at Swarovski’s HQ in Zürich</a>. Next it was <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6514177783709597698/"" target=""_blank"">a rambunctious UNLEASH</a> show in London (<a href=""https://www.slideshare.net/DavidGreen21/how-to-create-more-impact-with-people-analytics"" target=""_blank"">download my slides here</a>) before I headed off to Barcelona to speak at and chair the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6516209569344163840/"" target=""_blank"">Leading with Talent Analytics</a> conference. This week, I’ve hosted a TrustSphere and Culture Amp event on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6519155209422413824/"" target=""_blank"">Moving towards Data-Driven D&amp;I</a> in New York and will end my travels in Philadelphia for the <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6518092204496556032/"" target=""_blank"">Wharton People Analytics Conference</a>.</p>, <p>What is abundantly clear from all of these events is that people analytics continues to grow and thrive. Data has emerged as a core foundation of all parts of HR – from recruiting to performance management, from efforts to design and improve the employee experience to programs focused on diversity and inclusion. The rise in use of organisational network analysis (ONA) continues and the focus of the community to ensure that people data is used for good remains.</p>, <p>Whilst trying to escape Brexit and the increasing ineptitude of the British political class, I’ve found plenty of solace in a vintage collection of articles this month. I hope you enjoy learning from them as much as I did.</p>, <p>Look out also at the end for news of the <a href=""https://pafow.com/london19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work conference in London on 24-25 April</a>, but without further ado let’s get into the articles I’ve selected for March:</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>There’s certainly not a shortage of ideas when it comes to people analytics, but as <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveulrichpro/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Ulrich</a> highlights in his excellent article, it can all be a bit overwhelming at times. Instead, in order to ensure analytics provides sustainable impact, Ulrich advocates organising these ideas into three relatively simple questions: How? (“analytics that matter and that improves decision making”), What? (“analytics that link to business outcomes”), and How? “making analytics actionable”). If that wasn’t enough, Ulrich also provides an assessment enabling users to conduct analysis on their own analytics (see <strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong>).</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 1</em></strong><em>: Self-assessment of People Analytics efforts (Source: Dave Ulrich)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The Human Resources profession needs to change. It must become more digital and analytical to deliver greater business value – and as the findings of our recently published <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/skills-report"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Skills of the Future</a> study reveal, this is recognised by HR professionals themselves too. As <strong><em>FIG 2</em></strong> shows, 28% of respondents said People Analytics was the one skill they’d like to develop most in 2019. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanferrar/"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> highlights some of the key findings in his analysis of the report covering the Skills of the Future as well as the Future of Learning. <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/skills-report"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The full report is available to download</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 2: </em></strong><em>People analytics is the number one skill that HR professionals want to develop (Source: myHRfuture, 2019 HR Skills of the Future)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin/"" target=""_blank"">Josh Bersin</a> shares his latest thinking on some of the key methodologies for ‘Employee Experience’ (“design thinking, moments that matter, workforce segmentation, process harmonisation”), and the growing plethora of technology tools to help diagnose and improve employee experience. He goes on to provide a number of recommendations such as the need to pay special attention to onboarding, creating personas and engaging the people analytics team. Bersin has long spoken about creating the ‘irresistible organisation’ (see <strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong>), and implies heavily here that employee experience holds the key.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 3</em></strong><em>: The Irresistible Organisation – A complete Employee Experience (Source: Josh Bersin)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>It’s become increasingly obvious that the business value of traditional performance management models has disintegrated. In this excellent MIT/McKinsey study on rethinking the field we learn how the future of performance management is more data-driven, more flexible, more continuous, more development-oriented and shifting towards teams. Features insights from a plethora of CHROs including Donna Morris (Adobe), Diane Gherson (IBM) and Dean Carter (Patagonia) as well as the likes of Peter Cappelli, Ben Waber and Anna Tavis.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A brilliant article from Deloitte, which outlines that against a climate of 90% of companies exploring organisational design, how ONA can help leaders understand the formal and informal networks in their company, and consequently provide insights that result in more successful organisational redesign and business performance. The immense promise of ONA is captured perfectly by the authors when they liken adding ONA to other organisational design indicators, to adding MRIs and brain scan capabilities to the humble x-ray. For more on ONA, please see my article: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">The role of ONA in People Analytics</a>.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 4: </em></strong><em>Current and desired collaboration networks within the same part of an organisation as reported by employees (Source: Deloitte)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I was fortunate to catch-up recently with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619/"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, Head of People Analytics at Microsoft, to collaborate on an article that examines the role of employee trust in creating and sustaining an advanced people analytics function. As well as explaining her three core pillars of trust, Dawn provides an example of a people analytics/ONA project at Microsoft (see <strong><em>FIG 5</em></strong>) that provided demonstrable value to employees. The interview was inspired by Dawn’s recent speech at PAFOW in San Francisco.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 5: </em></strong><em>A manager’s email behaviour is related to their directs’ perceptions of work/life balance (Source: Dawn Klinghoffer)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In this insightful study, IBM’s Smarter Workforce Institute team examine the nature of diversity and inclusion, explore biases as an inhibitor to more diverse and inclusive workplaces, and provide insights into the role that AI can play in mitigating biases. There are several interesting insights including <strong><em>FIG 6</em></strong> below, which highlights that over 20% of HR professionals are concerned that AI could perpetuate or worsen bias. Practical recommendations – including the need to use the right data and the right algorithms - are also offered to organisations looking to adopt AI in their HR practices.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 6</em></strong>: One in five HR professionals are concerned that AI could perpetuate or increase biases (Source: IBM and UNLEASH Professional HR Study, 2018)</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A pair of terrific articles on diversity and inclusion. In the first, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/drtomaschamorro/"" target=""_blank"">Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic</a> (in a sneak preview of his new book, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Why-Many-Incompetent-Become-Leaders/dp/1633696324"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Why do so many incompetent men become leaders?</a>) discusses the need to stop associating leadership with masculine features in order to truly remove bias between the genders. The second article examines the impact of a lack of inclusion on individual employees, especially when they are a minority, and argues to put an end to costly workplace isolation (see <strong><em>FIG 7</em></strong>) experienced by many women, they should be clustered on teams and also improve the promotion process.</p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 7: </em></strong><em>LeanIn.Org and McKinsey Women in the Workplace study</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/cade-massey-8036282/"" target=""_blank"">Cade Massey</a> writes “<em>in the messy real world of ambiguous evidence and contentious objectives, organizational decisions — especially those about the people you’re hiring, developing, managing, and trying to retain — usually hinge on relationships and trust</em>.” This means that black boxes should probably be avoided and instead if you work in people analytics, you must learn to deal in the currency of trust to make an impact. It’s not enough to be right. You also have to sell your model or idea. An excellent and thoughtful piece.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I’m not sure how I missed this fabulous article by <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanpettman/"" target=""_blank"">Jordan Pettman</a> the first time around, but it’s time to redress the situation. Jordan, who is Global Head of People Analytics at Nestlé tackles the need to balance demand for reporting whilst ensuring that people analytics can realise its full promise. Jordan recommends a blend of harnessing technology to automate reporting together with a drive to help HR business partners improve their data literacy. All this is designed to give people analytics teams the time and space they need to increase their impact within the business.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A common mistake in people analytics is focussing on easily-accessible data, not the right data. In this article, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> writes on how to combine qualitative and quantitative data to create better models and therefore make better decisions.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A terrific collection of the types of insights that can be generated through people analytics, with nine examples covering areas such as leadership, recruiting, diversity and network analytics from a series of organisations – large and small as well as from the public sector. Features commentary from a host of practitioners including Olly Britnell (Experian), Greig Aitken (RBS), Andrea Owen (Office of National Statistics) and Toby Culshaw (Philips).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Having a CHRO that sets the agenda for a data-driven approach is a critical element in creating impact, value and sustainable capability in people analytics. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarina-berg-5375074/"" target=""_blank"">Katarina Berg</a> is one such CHRO and her article describes the approach to people analytics at Spotify, which is composed of three distinct buckets related to i) process transformation, ii) cultural transformation and iii) top-down strategic transformation.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Some great analysis here from <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciashermangarr/"" target=""_blank"">Stacia Garr</a>, who having reviewed over 30 published articles and academic papers (some of which she highlights), summarises the key trends in the space including: growth and maturity, a focus on the employee, collaboration and ethics, as well as some of the gaps.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-mcnulty/"" target=""_blank"">Keith McNulty</a> writes here, building a great analytics function isn’t just about having the right people. Having access to the right technology is crucial to getting the most out of your team. Keith’s article then goes on to describe a multitude of technologies across four areas: collaboration (e.g. Slack and Circuit), agile management (e.g. Trello), document and app sharing (e.g. R and Python), and version control (e.g. GitHub).</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjcook/"" target=""_blank"">Ian Cook</a> cuts through the hype associated with wearables, providing a powerful example of how Bank of America used wearable technology to identify that their call-centre employees with the fastest average call handling team were also their most social. The ensuing program the bank put in place generated a $15m uplift in annual productivity. Ian also provides a handy six-step process to unlocking the benefits of wearable data.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the most powerful examples of ONA is how GM used it to stimulate innovation and effectively disrupt themselves from the inside. The case study and the academic research behind it is documented in this wonderful MIT Sloan Management Review article. <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-organisational-network-analysis-people-analytics-david-green/"" target=""_blank"">For more great articles on ONA, there is a list here.</a></p>, <p><strong><em>FIG 8: </em></strong><em>Adaptive space is the network and organisational context that allows people, ideas, information, and resources to flow across the organisation and spur successful emergent innovation (Source: MIT SMR)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of my favourite books of the past year is <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/amedmondson/"" target=""_blank"">Amy Edmondson</a>’s <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Organization-Psychological-Workplace-Innovation/dp/1119477247"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Fearless Organization</a>, so this episode of Let’s Fix Work is certainly worth a listen as Amy joins host <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurieruettimann/"" target=""_blank"">Laurie Reuttimann</a> to talk psychological safety, inviting participation, and creating a productive workplace of tomorrow.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Along with <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/yvettecameron/"" target=""_blank"">Yvette Cameron</a>, who is also leading some ground-breaking work in this space, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation/"" target=""_blank"">Andy Spence</a> has become my go-to when it comes to understanding the role Blockchain will play in the future of work and the HR function. In this speech from the recent People Matters TechHR show in Singapore, Andy provides four examples of how Blockchain is already being used in HR, sprinkles in a dose of James Bond as well as taking the opportunity to impart plenty of dry Mancunian humour.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/arun-sundar-2290237/"" target=""_blank"">Arun Sundar</a> and I together with several senior HR leaders in Asia-Pacific examine how “Social Capital” can be leveraged to enhance collaboration within organisations and consequently drive improvements in business performance and team cohesion as well as a better employee experience. The article covers applications of passive ONA and is the third-part of a series of articles focusing on people analytics in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In my preview of the Wharton People Analytics Conference, I reflect on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/adammgrant/"" target=""_blank"">Adam Grant</a>’s closing remarks from last year’s conference. Grant outlined three challenges for the people analytics community to think about: (i) bringing your data to life to challenge intuition, (ii) researching the importance of sequencing, and (iii) studying the effect of our behaviour on others.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>A few weeks back, I had the honour of being MC of the inaugural SHRM Tech EMEA conference in Dubai. This article summarises my key takeaways from the event with insights from the likes of Mark Levy, Jason Averbook, Anna Tavis and Rana Askoul, topics ranging from Employee Experience, HR Technology, the Future of Work and People Analytics and how this is shaping the future of HR.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I also spoke on the Influencers stage at UNLEASH in London recently on how to create more impact with people analytics. The <a href=""https://www.slideshare.net/DavidGreen21/how-to-create-more-impact-with-people-analytics"" target=""_blank"">deck is available to download on Slideshare</a> and includes data illustrating the rapid growth in adoption of people analytics, the Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics model I co-created with Jonathan Ferrar and a number of case studies highlighting how organisations have used people analytics to drive business outcomes and improve employee experience.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>I had the pleasure of being a guest on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/walkeralan/"" target=""_blank"">Alan Walker</a>’s excellent Chat Talent webinar where I talked about the rise of people analytics, walked through some cases studies and presented highlights of the aforementioned <a href=""https://www.myhrfuture.com/skills-report"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HR Skills of the Future</a> report.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Mercifully, April will be a quieter month than March and when I return from the Wharton People Analytics Conference in Philadelphia at the end of the week, I won’t be leaving the UK for the rest of the month – although with all the shenanigans about Brexit maybe that isn’t such a good thing after all. The main event for me in April is <a href=""https://pafow.com/london19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">PAFOW London on 24-25 April</a>, which I’ll co-chair with Al Adamsen. If you fancy joining me at PAFOW along with a terrific program of speakers including Nicky Clement, Isabel Naidoo, Patrick Coolen, Brydie Lear, Oliver Kasper, Annemieke Nennie, Blair Hopkins, Mark Lawrence, Brad Hubbard, Maria Manso, Jordan Pettman and many more. <a href=""https://pafow.com/london19"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Click here and use my code DG200 for a £200 discount</a>.</p>, <p>I’ll be chairing and/or speaking about people analytics, data-driven HR and the <em>Nine Dimensions for Excellence in People Analytics</em> model at the following events until the end of October 2019. </p>, <p>______________________________________________________________________</p>, <p>David is a globally respected writer, speaker, conference chair, and executive consultant on people analytics, data-driven HR and the future of work.
