David R. Green,The 20 best HR Analytics articles of 2014,2015,Qtr1,Jan,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-2014-david-green/,"[<p>According to revered authorities such as Josh Bersin, 2015 promises to be the year that analytics goes mainstream in HR. As such, I thought it may be helpful to warm-up with a list of my favourite HR Analytics articles of 2014 (listed in no particular order):</p>, <p><strong>1. iNostix </strong>– <strong><a href=""http://www.inostix.com/blog/en/hr-analytics-will-transform-world-hiring/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">How HR Analytics will transform the world of hiring</a></strong> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/iNostix"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">@iNostix</a></p>, <p>Luk Smeyers and Jeroen Delmotte’s Leuven based firm iNostix is one of the most interesting and progressive vendors in the HR analytics space. This extends to their blog, which regularly churns out thoughtful and informative posts. The example selected persuasively provides five ways in which predictive analytics will transform recruiting.</p>, <p><strong>2. Patrick Coolen</strong> – <strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-golden-rules-hr-analytics-patrick-coolen?trk=vsrp_people_res_infl_post_title"" target=""_blank"">The 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics</a></strong> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/PatrickCoolen"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">@PatrickCoolen</a></p>, <p>Patrick has developed a formidable reputation for his work at ABN AMRO where he has introduced predictive analytics into the HR space. Here he provides his version of the 10 commandments - related of course to HR analytics. For more on what Patrick has achieved at ABN AMRO check out this piece on the iNostix blog: <em><a href=""http://www.inostix.com/blog/en/the-hr-analytics-journey-at-abn-amro-interview-with-patrick-coolen/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">The HR Analytics Journey at ABN AMRO</a></em>.</p>, <p><strong>3.

It presents the case for and against HR Analytics being under the auspices of the HR department – they certainly provoked some healthy debate. If you were on the jury, how would you vote?</p>, <p><strong>4. Andrew Marritt</strong> – <strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141112084226-78008-the-5-types-of-hr-analytics-vendors?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">5 Types of HR Analytics Vendors</a></strong> | <a href=""https://twitter.com/AndrewMarritt"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">@AndrewMarritt</a></p>, <p>My co-chair at the <em><a href=""https://www.tucana-global.com/conference/people-analytics-2015"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics 2015 conference</a></em> is one of the leading authorities in the HR Analytics space through his <a href=""http://www.organizationview.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Organization View</em></a> business. Andrew has published a series of blogs on LinkedIn - and several white papers that are well worth getting hold of. This one classifying the five types of HR Analytics vendors is a must-read for any CHRO considering ramping up their analytics efforts in 2015.</p>, <p><strong>5.

In this detailed Deloitte University Press publication, Bersin and his cohorts outline how organisations can quickly go from talking (or even avoiding?) to delivering on HR analytics.</p>, <p><strong>9.

His article from October arguing that for the vast majority of organisations data in HR is rarely ‘big’ really resonates.</p>, <p><strong>12. Nathan R. Kuncel, Deniz S. Ones and David M.

David R. Green,The 21 best HR Analytics articles of 2015,2016,Qtr1,Jan,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21-best-hr-analytics-articles-2015-david-green/,"[<p>The growth of analytics within HR has been steady rather than spectacular, but I sense that 2016 could be the year of the great leap forward. Only 10-15% of organisations have what could be termed as ‘mature’ people analytics functions, but interest levels amongst the other 85-90% has arguably never been higher.</p>, <p>As such, this collection of my favourite people analytics articles of 2015 should be a useful resource for those interested in this subject. It includes contributions from ‘in-house’ practitioners, vendors, analysts, influencers and commentators on the people analytics space.</p>, <p>So, in no particular order, let’s get started…</p>, <p><strong>1. Josh Bersin | <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-takes-off-ten-things-weve-learned-josh-bersin"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics Takes Off: 10 Things We’ve Learned</a></strong></p>, <p>The first of two entries by Josh Bersin examines the ‘State of the Market’ for people analytics and includes a number of fascinating findings including i) growth will be exponential, but we are still in the early days, ii) most companies still don't really know what People Analytics really is, iii) modelling is valuable but implementing models (i.e. change management) is key, and iv) we have to work together - we are all learning now – i.e. (and to borrow from Lars Schmidt’s and Ambrosia Vertesi’s <em><a href=""http://hros.co/hros/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">#HROS initiative</a></em>) HR Analytics Open Source.</p>, <p><iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" data-li-src=""//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/sib0bdvswg8qgi"" frameborder=""0"" height=""355"" src=""about:blank"" width=""425""></iframe></p>, <p><strong>2.

This article provides his retrospective view of 2015 and confirms my own impression (and that of Josh Bersin’s above) that analytics has gathered significant momentum with HR leaders over the last 12 months – marvellous news for all of us operating in this burgeoning space.</p>, <p><strong>3. Inside HR |</strong> <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/what-hr-metrics-are-investors-interested-in/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>What HR Metrics Are Investors Most Interested In?</strong></a></p>, <p>This article in <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>Inside HR</em></a> reports on a joint study between Harvard Law School and the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute. It reveals the growing interest from the investment community into the correlation between human capital and financial outcomes such as return on equity, return on investment and profit margins. The study (<em><a href=""http://irrcinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FINAL-Human-Capital-Materiality-April-23-20151.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">see full report</a></em>) establishes a meaningful connection between the two implying that “companies with a convincing HR story and strong data to back it up are likely to receive a welcome reception from many institutional investors.”</p>, <p><strong>4.

As well as generating better talent outcomes in terms of leadership pipelines, cost reductions, efficiency gains and mobility, perhaps the most telling finding was that the share prices of these pioneering 14% outpaced the S&amp;P 500 by an average 30% from 2011-14. If that doesn’t make the case for people analytics, I'm not sure what does.</p>, <p><strong>5.

The first 100 days are critical to the success of any business initiative, which makes this white paper all the more indispensable for would be HR analytics leaders. Aspirants are guided through a series of steps, collectively designed to lead to maximise impact within those priceless first 100 days.</p>, <p><strong>6.

And how can you get senior leaders to realise that just because sometimes these variables are hard to measure doesn’t mean you shouldn’t bring better science to them?”</p>, <p><strong>13.

The first half of my year has seen me speaking at and chairing people analytics conferences in San Francisco, Amsterdam, London, Sydney and New York. </p>, <p>My travels have confirmed that: i) some great work is being done in the people analytics space, ii) interest in the subject has risen sharply, and; iii) (dare I say it) adoption levels are also increasing. Long may all three indicators continue to move in an upwards trajectory.</p>, <p>The first half of 2016 has also seen a wealth of fabulous articles published. As such, I hope this collection of some of the best proves an invaluable resource for colleagues working in the space and those interested in learning more.

David R. Green,The 40 best HR Analytics articles of H2 2016,2016,Qtr4,Dec,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green/,"[<p>If the Christmas classic that is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HkJHApgKqw"" target=""_blank"">Stop the Cavalry</a> by Jona Lewie is playing on the radio, it must mean that 2016 is nearing its end. The year has simply flown by.</p>, <p>I’m in the fortunate position to have a unique view of the developing space of people analytics. 2016 has seen plenty of great work being done (see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-ii-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-more-people-analytics-case-studies-part-i-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), and interest levels in the subject have soared. Adoption levels are still lagging, with the rise in organisations embracing a data-driven approach to HR being steady rather than spectacular.</p>, <p>Selecting the best people analytics articles of the second half of 2016 has been a momentous task given both the quality and quantity of articles that are now being published. Even refining down to my favourite 40 has been a difficult and time-consuming process. As ever, I hope the collection proves an invaluable resource for colleagues working in the space and those interested in learning more. Enjoy and do let me know in the comments section, any articles I may have missed.</p>, <p>In no particular order…</p>, <p>One of the smartest HR leaders I’ve had the pleasure to come across, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/placidjover"" target=""_blank"">Placid Jover</a> was recently appointed to lead HR for Unilever’s £3 billion UK business. Previously, Placid had established and led Unilever’s global Organisation Performance and HR Analytics team. In this thoughtful article, Placid reflects on his experiences, how the space has evolved and what the future holds for analytics and how it will underpin HR. Placid's observations on the field are fascinating. This really is a must-read.</p>, <p>The evening before publishing, this tremendous article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a> of LinkedIn landed in my inbox causing me to make a last-minute change to the final 40. It recounts the story of how LinkedIn’s talent acquisition team couldn’t fill roles fast enough as the organisation grew by over 40% a year. Analytics were employed to build visibility and accountability into the hiring process. The results were astounding. The model that was built was able to predict within 5% actual numbers hired. Even more impressive is the fact that the intervention saved the company 15% of its recruiting budget in year one, which covered the cost of the investment in LinkedIn’s Talent Analytics team for more than 4 years. You see, this was simply too good to leave out! The Slideshare below, which was presented by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifershappley"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Shappley</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/phamchristopher"" target=""_blank"">Chris Pham</a> at Talent Connect, also covers this outstanding project. If case studies on people analytics are your thing see <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-ii-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-more-people-analytics-case-studies-part-i-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-2-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-people-analytics-case-studies-part-1-david-green?trk=mp-reader-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The people analytics space is evolving quickly so it was definitely time for <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a> to update his much-loved 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics. The result is the best version yet as not only has Patrick employed crowdsourcing techniques for what is v3.0, but he has also taken the time to highlight examples of the research he and his team have conducted at ABN AMRO. My favourite rule? That has to be a tie between #2 ‘Only do business relevant research’ and #3 ‘Create actionable insights’. Read more on the people analytics journey at ABN AMRO <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>Whilst HR is “the new kid on the block” in the business when it comes to analytics this doesn't have to be an obstacle providing the function is prepared to leverage experiences from elsewhere in the organisation. In this perceptive article in the <a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">MIT Sloan Management Review</a>, the authors describe four lessons from customer analytics that can easily be applied to people analytics. This is a must-read for budding and experienced analytics practitioners alike.   </p>, <p>Bersin by Deloitte’s recent <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/business-talent-hr-predictions-2017-everything-becoming-josh-bersin"" target=""_blank"">2017 HR Predictions</a> is pretty bullish in its assertion that the next 12 months will see analytics move from a niche group in HR to an important operational business function (I certainly hope so!). This is borne out in this positive market analysis by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, Bersin’s People Analytics Research Leader. Madhura highlights three emerging trends in the space: i) the need for people analytics to add value to the business; ii) analytics as the new normal for HR; and iii) the critical role of technology. Look out for Bersin’s High-Impact People Analytics study, when it is published in 2017. </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: People Analytics maturity is growing (Source: Bersin by Deloitte, 2017 HR Predictions)</em></p>, <p>As I’ve toured the conference circuit in 2016, the issue of ethics and trust invariably crops up when the subject turns to people analytics. <a href=""http://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> believes that trust is the most important part of doing great people analytics, and I’m inclined to agree with him. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data. Not only does it affect the quality of data available, it also makes people analytics initiatives unsustainable. The Virtuous Circle of Data Quality (see Figure 2 below), conceptualised by Andrew, provides a convincing case for placing employee trust at the heart of any people analytics strategy.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: The Virtuous circle of data quality (Source: Andrew Marritt | Organization View)</em></p>, <p>In just a few short months, <a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Analytics in HR</a> has rapidly emerged as one of the premier resources for those working and interested in the people analytics space. Ticking both the quantity and quality boxes, there is a wealth of excellent proprietary and third party content to choose from. Choosing just one article was difficult, but I’ve plumped for this excellent piece by <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> on five reasons why HR Analytics projects fail. It’s an invaluable guide on the pitfalls to avoid for anyone working in a people analytics role, especially those just getting started – as is the recent book (<a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/ebook-basic-principles-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>The basic principles of People Analytics</em></a>) Erik and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/nandosteenhuis"" target=""_blank"">Nando Steenhuis</a> have published. I was so impressed that I happily agreed to write the foreword. </p>, <p>Failure, or more pertinently how to avoid it, is also the subject of this fabulous article by <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, one of the leading consultants and influencers in the field. The article is designed to help budding aspirants harness people analytics, and avoid project failure, by presenting a systematic, cost-effective methodology for creating robust data sets that correlate. It’s an eminently readable resource full of great advice and tips to avoid the many pitfalls that can befall even the pluckiest of novices. See Max speak at <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> in London on 25-26 April.</p>, <p>This article, which captures the main findings of the authors’ provocative <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1748-8583.12090/abstract"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">white paper</a>, asserts that the lack of progress with analytics is in part down to the lack of analytical understanding on the part of HR, whilst also apportioning blame to an industry touting expensive and complex products. The authors then offer some tips around developing an analytical mindset, focusing on the business, data governance and building the right skills and capabilities to conduct analytics. </p>, <p>Whilst acknowledging his own excitement about the role people analytics will play in transforming organisations, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrewspencehrtransformation"" target=""_blank"">Andy Spence</a> correctly asserts that despite the hype adoption rates remain frustratingly low. He then describes seven challenges HR needs to overcome, as well as providing some astute advice to help practitioners succeed. Read the article alongside the accompanying Slideshare below. </p>, <p>Whilst I wrote this article, credit for the content has to go to <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/sheri-feinzig-00a259a"" target=""_blank"">Sheri Feinzig</a> (and her co-authors <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/nigel-guenole-phd-89824b2"" target=""_blank"">Nigel Guenole</a> and <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a>), hence me being able to include it in this collection. During research for their upcoming book <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">“The Power of People: How Successful Organizations Use Workforce Analytics To Improve Business Performance”</a>, Dr. Feinzig and her co-authors found three categories of resistance that organisations need to overcome: i) stakeholder scepticism, ii) financial frugalness and iii) HR hesitancy. This article describes these three areas as well as providing recommendations as to how they can be overcome.  </p>, <p>Many organisations choose to get started with people analytics by conducting a needs analysis with their HR colleagues. In this indispensible article, <a href=""http://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a> of <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a> questions this approach and instead offers his own guide for CHROs looking to get started. I particularly like Luk’s suggestion that the people analytics function should be the right-hand ‘intelligence service’ of the CHRO - data driven HR indeed.</p>, <p>Those looking to make a case for investing in people analytics in their organisations would do well to utilise the evidence presented here by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lexymartin"" target=""_blank"">Lexy Martin</a>. The article highlights research by Sierra-Cedar demonstrating organisations with workforce analytics and data-driven decision making outperform those that don’t. The four characteristics of these “quantified” organisations are then outlined. Compelling stuff!</p>, <p>The glacial pace of progress in people analytics is perhaps not surprising since HR is trying to remake itself in an entirely new image, in an environment where supply of new analytical talent—and budget to hire them—is extremely limited. This article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a> (also a <a href=""http://twitter.com/EvanSinar"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">must-follow on Twitter</a>) and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/richwellins"" target=""_blank"">Rich Wellins</a> describes the skills and traits HR needs, how well (or not) the function is prepared (see Figure 3 below) and the relationships in the business that can best help propel HR forward. </p>, <p><em>Figure 3: What HR needs to thrive with Analytics (Source: DDI)</em></p>, <p>The field of people analytics has attracted many bright young things that otherwise probably wouldn’t have considered a career in HR. <a href=""http://de.linkedin.com/in/stefan-hierl-1488932"" target=""_blank"">Stefan Hierl</a>, who leads people analytics at Adidas is one such example. This article in the superb <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside HR</a> describes the three core pillars of Adidas’ people analytics strategy: i) align with the business to define what success looks like, ii) use data and insights to improve the employee experience, and iii) support broader strategic decision-making. </p>, <p>As <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, Head of Global Workforce Analytics at Experian, testifies in this article, many organisations are still swimming in the slow lane when it comes to workforce analytics. As he goes on to state, it doesn’t have to be a struggle, and this is even less likely to be the case if organisations and nascent analytics leaders follow the excellent advice in this article. Effective stakeholder management, building a balanced team and prioritising education and awareness are just three of the tips provided.</p>, <p>Having a CHRO who not only sponsors but is involved in the people analytics initiative is a common factor I have seen in organisations that are successful in this space. One such CHRO is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/monique-herena-b55464a4"" target=""_blank"">Monique Herena</a> of BNY Mellon. In this article, she outlines the guiding principles she has followed to establish people analytics capability at the bank. </p>, <p>Another CHRO who has written about their organisation’s people analytics journey is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a>. This article describes how Microsoft is using analytics to help employees and teams to become more productive. More importantly, it also tackles the question of employee trust. Hogan emphasises that the purpose is to empower rather than undermine employee decision-making and articulates her vision of creating the ability for employees to own their data, improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance. Read more on Microsoft’s people analytics journey with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a> <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p>The second entry from the excellent <a href=""http://www.insidehr.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Inside HR</a> comes from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/christadegnan"" target=""_blank"">Christa Degnan Manning</a> of <a href=""http://home.bersin.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bersin by Deloitte</a>. It describes four emerging trends that are increasingly shaping the field of people analytics. The main trend featured is how companies are using previously untapped sources of data (e.g. social media, biometrics, wearables) to derive insights to help tackle pressing people challenges. The other trends featured are: i) tools to support more frequent and real-time measurement; ii) integration of data from disparate sources; and iii) easier, faster analytics and visualisation of data. Speaking of which…</p>, <p>Sentiment analysis has long been used by organisations to better understand its customers and, as this piece in The Atlantic reports, is now increasingly being used by forward-thinking organisations to get invaluable insights on their employees. The article provides two excellent examples from Twitter and IBM – indeed the latter used an internally developed sentiment-analysis tool called Social Pulse to engage its employees in a revamp of its performance-review system. </p>, <p>Do algorithms completely eliminate bias and prejudice from hiring? Of course not and indeed, as described by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/gideon-mann-223a2912"" target=""_blank"">Gideon Mann</a> and <a href=""http://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Cathy O’Neil</a> in this HBR piece, left to their own devices algorithms can even exacerbate bias - humans make them after all. The article examines this challenge and advocates the continual audit and modification of algorithms to limit inequity. As algorithms take on a larger role, HR professionals will do well to heed the advice offered here.</p>, <p>How do you engage HRBPs and make them “consumers of analytics”? This was the weighty challenge set for the first Human Capital Analytics hackathon held by Copenhagen Business School. The solutions are nicely summarised in this article by <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/saskia-menke-788b9ba0/en"" target=""_blank"">Saskia Menke</a>. It is certainly an important challenge for organisations if they are to scale analytics and create a sustainable capability across HR, so the findings make for interesting reading. </p>, <p>We read a lot about <a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/demystifying-people-analytics-part-3-the-power-of-storytelling/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">storytelling in people analytics</a>, which as <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen"" target=""_blank"">Morten Kamp Andersen</a> acknowledges in this article is one of the core requisites for success in this field. However, as Andersen goes on to argue, storytelling on its own can actually be harmful if you do not have a plausible and well-documented theory behind your data. Certainly, the example he provides in the article on leadership effectiveness by gender presents a convincing case.</p>, <p>Many organisations decide to build a Centre of Excellence (CoE) as part of its attempt to develop people analytics capability. In this piece, <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/manojkumarhranalytics"" target=""_blank"">Manoj Kumar</a>, who led HSBC’s HR Analytics CoE for five years, outlines five reasons why a CoE may not deliver ROI within expected timelines whilst also suggesting fixes to each of these challenges. I can also highly recommend Manoj’s <a href=""http://talkinghranalytics.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talking HR Analytics</a> blog as an excellent resource for those working or interested in the field. </p>, <p>A key outcome of many people analytics projects is that the insights are counterintuitive to the common wisdom of many HR (and business) leaders. This article in the McKinsey Quarterly provides three such case studies in the areas of sourcing, screening and attrition. The last example in particular resonates where the finding that employees in smaller teams, with longer periods between promotions and with lower-performing managers, were more likely to leave led to a far more tailored and focused approach.</p>, <p>Another practitioner article comes from <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/sidshishoo"" target=""_blank"">Sidhartha Shishoo</a> of Genpact on the excellent <a href=""http://www.peoplematters.in/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Matters</a> site. The article describes some of the challenges Genpact faced when embarking on its people analytics journey including i) separating analytics from reporting, ii) data quality, iii) building capability and iv) employee privacy. It’s an outstanding article and one that emphasises the need for boldness: in thinking, in strategy and in application when it comes to people analytics.</p>, <p><a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/tomhaak"" target=""_blank"">Tom Haak</a> makes a couple of points in this article that really resonate. When it comes to people analytics i) the sense of urgency is missing in too many organisations, and ii) instead of talking about it, just get started. Tom then outlines five steps to getting started.</p>, <p>Being a mathematician, prolific writer and consultant <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> tables 13 (it’s a prime!) ideas for the budding people analytics aspirant to get started. Together, these cover the whole gamut of people operations from recruiting through to engagement, performance and retention – all with the emphasis on providing business value. Plenty to inspire here.</p>, <p><a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> trains HR practitioners through his ‘Practical People Analytics’ course (and very good it is too, by all accounts). This article describes some of the lessons this experience has taught him such as the need to i) differentiate between reporting and analytics, ii) embrace rather than eschew traditional HR intuition and iii) collaborate and share. Read the article for further insights.</p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/beneubanks"" target=""_blank"">Ben Eubanks</a> (check out his <a href=""http://upstarthr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Upstart HR blog</a>) is one of the best of the new breed of HR analysts, so it is good to read that he believes the subject of analytics is getting serious traction amongst leaders. Similar to the article above by Sam Hill, Eubanks recognises that HR sometimes struggles to differentiate between the different types of analytics, so this definition of descriptive, predictive and prescriptive should prove a helpful resource for many.</p>, <p>Google is the poster organisation for people analytics and there have been countless articles written about their phenomenal success in this space. These two rank amongst the best. First, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/stgmaier/en"" target=""_blank"">Steffen Meier</a> describes Google’s data-driven approach and use of employee feedback to optimise its people processes and culture. He also summarises Project Oxygen (on leadership) and Project Aristotle (on team effectiveness). The New York Times article provides a fascinating and detailed description of Aristotle, which is an essential read. </p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The five key factors of team effectiveness at Google (Source: re:Work, Project Aristotle)</em></p>, <p>Google is also featured in hiQ Labs head honcho <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/darrengrantglobal"" target=""_blank"">Darren Kaplan</a>’s tribute to its former HR head <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/laszlobock"" target=""_blank"">Laszlo Bock</a>, who announced he was stepping down from his role at the tech giant earlier this year. As Kaplan rightly asserts, Bock is one of the (if not ‘the’) most influential figures in people analytics and data driven HR and all of us in the space have a lot to be grateful to him for. Some of Kaplan’s colleagues at hiQ also deserve a mention and I also highly recommend reading these three articles: i) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelhousman"" target=""_blank"">Michael Housman</a> reports on the recent hiQ Elevate awards as well as providing an astute analysis of the space, ii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/teuschb"" target=""_blank"">Ben Teusch</a> makes a plea for more articles at the ‘micro level’, which offer explanations of which kinds of analyses are useful for people analytics, and; iii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-a-hammond"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Hammond</a> on the opportunity and challenge of the cognitive funnel in people analytics. Quite a quartet of articles there. </p>, <p>One of the most interesting HR Tech firms I’ve come across is <a href=""http://www.saberr.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Saberr</a>, who focus on making teams work well together. They’ve also employed research methods to understand how values operate at different levels of the organisation (individual, team and organisation). CEO <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/tom-marsden-b04282"" target=""_blank"">Tom Marsden</a> details the methodology and findings from the research in this engrossing article. </p>, <p><em>Figure 5: How values impact organisations (Source: Saberr)</em></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/burkepowers"" target=""_blank"">Burke Powers</a>, who leads people data, reporting and analytics at PayPal, is an advocate of design thinking to get greater understanding and adoption when tackling any analytics project. In this excellent article, Burke outlines his theory and uses eight case study examples from the likes of Google, KPMG and Microsoft as evidence of the benefits of placing design thinking at the heart of an analytics project. </p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>’s Future of Work podcast is always worth a listen and this is certainly the case when it comes to this episode featuring <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a>, CEO of <a href=""http://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a>, a social sensing and analytics platform that uses sensors in employee ID badges to drive team effectiveness and engagement. Waber offers some fascinating observations on the people analytics space, not least i) start small, but do something that makes you uncomfortable and outside of your comfort zone, ii) if you don’t start people analytics in the next two years it will be hard to catch up with those that have, and iii) on average people analytics increases top line performance by 10-15%.</p>, <p>One of the reasons tabled by HR for being unable to get started with people analytics is data quality (or the lack of it). There’s no doubt that you need to be able to justify your data when challenged, but at the same time the desire for the nirvana of 100% clean data is wholly unrealistic. This outstanding article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-kennedy-a936283"" target=""_blank"">Cameron Kennedy</a> guides the would-be analyst through some of the pitfalls and offers plenty of practical tips on collecting, cleaning and analysing data. </p>, <p>A regular entrant in my collection of the best articles on people analytics is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-roberts-b0217"" target=""_blank"">Greta Roberts</a>. In this short and sweet piece, Greta makes a simple but important observation on how HR is often misaligned to the business because it doesn’t measure the same goals. In analytics, we teach the importance of focusing on the business first and foremost, so perhaps it is in adopting people analytics that HR can find its way out of the morass Greta highlights.</p>, <p>If people analytics is to become a core part of HR’s repertoire and underpin the function of the future, the teaching of HR has to have a heavy emphasis on data, science and analytics within its curricula.

David R. Green,The 30 best HR Analytics articles of 2016,2017,Qtr1,Jan,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/30-best-hr-analytics-articles-2016-david-green/,"[<p>People Analytics and data driven HR continues to generate huge amounts of interest amongst those working in or associated with the field of human resources.</p>, <p>The potential analytics has to underpin the future transformation of HR with regards to digital, personalising the employee experience and identifying actionable insights that lead to better business outcomes is recognised by many but to date has only been realised by few.</p>, <p>For the last three years, I’ve collected what I believe are the best people analytics articles of the preceding 12 months. The purpose is to (hopefully) provide a useful resource for those already operating in or those who aspire to work in the field of people analytics (see collections from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20-best-hr-analytics-articles-2014-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2014</em></a><em>, </em><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21-best-hr-analytics-articles-2015-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2015</em></a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/27-best-hr-analytics-articles-h1-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2016 Jan-Jun</em></a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank""><em>2016 Jul-Dec</em></a>).</p>, <p>I have been motivated to do this ‘Best of 2016’ piece because I missed (either due to publication date or my own human error) seven articles from my previous two 2016 collections. These articles are too good not to be recognised, so without further ado and in no particular order…</p>, <p>It may seem strange to begin with an article that was published in 2015, but having somehow not included it 12 months ago, it only seems fair to start with what is one of the most important articles on people analytics I have read. The white paper provides a critique of the HR centric approach adopted by the majority of organisations when it comes to analytics and instead advocates an “outside-in” method targeted at solving real business problems. Two excellent examples from Maersk Drilling are highlighted to support the argument. Case 1 (see <em><strong>Figure 1</strong></em> below) examines the impact of leadership quality and crew competence on safety, operational performance, and customer satisfaction whilst Case 2 examines the ROI and Strategic Impact of a Technical Trainee Acceleration Program. As the article reveals, both cases show that analytics is far more effective when tackled from a business (rather than an inward looking HR) perspective and that analytics should be treated as a change management process. <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hedegaard-rasmussen-9b26043"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Rasmussen</a> is Vice-President of HR Data and Analytics at Shell, which is often (and rightly) cited as one of the leading practices on the planet. To find out more about what Shell is doing please see my interview <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hr-analytics-journey-shell-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> with <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/esther-bongenaar-0603898a"" target=""_blank"">Esther Bongenaar</a> and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/vgiagkoulas"" target=""_blank"">Vasilis Giagkoulas</a>. </p>, <p><em>Figure 1: HR analytics in Maersk Drilling. Percentages shown are the squared correlations, i.e., amount of variance explained. Often HR Analytics teams will only link leadership quality and turnover (box 3), while a broad analytics approach looks at the entire value chain</em> <em> (Source: Maersk Drilling, Dave Ulrich &amp; Thomas Rasmussen)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Another brilliant article – this time published just days after my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">H2 2016 collection</a> is this insightful and must-read piece by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-walter-3baa8a9"" target=""_blank"">Anthony Walter</a>, who leads Talent Strategy and Workforce Analytics at Gap. As Anthony correctly highlights, the volume of analytical insights continues to grow and whilst this is positive it is arguably a waste if these insights do not lead to <em><strong>meaningful</strong></em> actions that help <em><strong>drive</strong></em> business results. Anthony highlights four key areas of focus and suggests how these gaps between insights and action can be bridged. The four areas are: i) lack of alignment between business strategy and analytics, ii) missing skills in the analytics team (e.g. storytelling, influencing, consulting), iii) cultural impediments that block or slow down action, and; iv) the absence of feedback mechanisms to understand the impact of actions.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>One of the smartest HR leaders I’ve had the pleasure to come across, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/placidjover"" target=""_blank"">Placid Jover</a> was recently appointed to lead HR for Unilever’s £3 billion UK business. Previously, Placid had established and led Unilever’s global Organisation Performance and HR Analytics team. In this thoughtful article, Placid reflects on his experiences, how the space has evolved and what the future holds for analytics and how it will underpin the HR of the future. Like the previous two articles, Placid emphasises the importance of focusing on insights that lead to business outcomes. A must-read.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>In the previous article, Placid highlighted that Unilever is fortunate to have a CHRO who embraces data and lives and breathes the insight it brings to the organisation and people agendas. The role of the CHRO is pivotal, as <a href=""http://be.linkedin.com/in/luksmeyers"" target=""_blank"">Luk Smeyers</a>, Co-Founder of <a href=""http://www.inostix.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">iNostix by Deloitte</a>, makes clear in this article for the <a href=""http://blog.hrn.io/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">HRN Blog</a>. Luk makes an impassioned plea for CHROs to work closely with their HR Analytics leader arguing that this is how HR can have a demonstrable impact on business results. The second article - an interview with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>, former HR Analytics leader and now CHRO, illustrates Luk’s point perfectly. Mark argues that when executed correctly people analytics can be the “<em>GPS of HR</em>”, as he answers with typical candour and insight a series of questions on people analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Continuing Luk’s theme, having a CHRO who not only sponsors but is involved in driving the people analytics initiative is a common <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-constitutes-best-practice-people-analytics-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">best practice</a> I have seen in organisations that are successful in this space. One such CHRO is <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenthogan"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hogan</a>. The first article describes how Microsoft is using analytics to help employees and teams to become more productive. More importantly, it also tackles the question of employee trust. Hogan emphasises that the purpose is to empower rather than undermine employee decision-making and articulates her vision of creating the ability for employees to own their data, improve their engagement at work, and enhance their work/life balance. Read more on Microsoft’s people analytics journey in my interview with <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>, who leads the HR Business Insights team <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-3-dawn-klinghoffer-microsoft-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and also an in-depth case study on the excellent <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/index"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valuing your Talent</a> site <a href=""http://www.valuingyourtalent.com/research-resources/case-studies/microsoft"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>When I speak to people analytics leaders, the topic of ethics and trust is never far from the top of the list. <a href=""http://ch.linkedin.com/in/andrewmarritt"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Marritt</a> believes that trust is the most important part of doing great people analytics, and I’m inclined to agree with him. If your employees don’t trust what you will do with their data they won’t give it to you, or won’t provide relevant, truthful data. Not only does it affect the quality of data available, it also makes people analytics initiatives unsustainable. The Virtuous Circle of Data Quality (see <em><strong>Figure 2</strong></em> below), conceptualised by Andrew, provides a convincing case for placing employee trust at the heart of any people analytics strategy.</p>, <p><em>Figure 2: The Virtuous circle of data quality (Source: Andrew Marritt | Organization View)</em></p>, <p>One of the best events I attended last year was SHRM’s 18th Thought Leaders Retreat on using workforce analytics for competitive advantage. The event featured some of the leading academics and practitioners in the field and this article captures the many insights that were outlined and discussed over the two days. To pick just four examples: i) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexisfink"" target=""_blank"">Alexis Fink</a> highlighted that the value of analytics is in discovering how it can make a difference to the organisation, ii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-levenson-8915475"" target=""_blank"">Alec Levenson</a> (see also Alec’s superb <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-solemnly-swear-hr-data-analytics-manifesto-alec-levenson?trk=prof-post"" target=""_blank"">HR Analytics manifesto</a>) describing how analysing at the team level, rather than the individual level, can offer bigger returns, iii) <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-klinghoffer-18117619"" target=""_blank"">Dawn Klinghoffer</a>’s advice that sometimes it’s the quick wins that make leaders come back and ask for more, and; iv) that greater use of analytics requires HR leaders to think hard about ethical factors: what data is used, how it is used, how data is protected, and in what ways use of data and analytics might cross an ethical line. For more on using workforce analytics for competitive advantage also see <a href=""http://www.shrm.org/about/foundation/shapingthefuture/documents/eiu%20theme%203%20analytics%20report-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">this white paper</a> published by SHRM two months prior to the retreat.</p>, <p><em>Figure 3: Intel's People Analytics methodology (Source: Alexis Fink | SHRM)</em></p>, <p>Published just a day after my <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/40-best-hr-analytics-articles-h2-2016-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">H2 2016 collection</a>, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/amitmohindra"" target=""_blank""><em>Amit Mohindra</em></a> was right to highlight that this superb article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzocanlas"" target=""_blank""><em>Lorenzo Canlas</em></a>, Head of Talent Analytics at LinkedIn, demanded inclusion. Lorenzo describes how his team has refined its mission to helping leaders use talent as a lever to achieve business objectives and how their success is defined as having a measurable impact to business or talent metrics. As Amit also commented the evolution Lorenzo describes from ""arming decision-makers"" to actively participating in the intervention/solution is game-changing. The financial return (see <em><strong>Figure 4</strong></em> below) of Lorenzo’s team demonstrates the significant impact that people analytics can have. Lorenzo goes on to cite several examples of the work his team has undertaken such as that impressively outlined in the second article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccapwhite"" target=""_blank"">Rebecca White</a>. This describes how a single project to better forecast and plan for how many recruiters were needed as the organisation scaled at over 40% a year, including where and when they were needed, predicted within 5% the actual numbers hired, saved the company 15% of its recruiting budget in year one and consequently paid for talent analytics for over four years. The Slideshare below, which was presented by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifershappley"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Shappley</a> and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/phamchristopher"" target=""_blank"">Chris Pham</a> at Talent Connect, also recounts this outstanding project.</p>, <p><em>Figure 4: The ROI of LinkedIn's Talent Analytics team (Source: Lorenzo Canlas)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Storytelling is the last mile problem in analytics. Fail to develop a compelling story for your stakeholder and even great insights and analysis will be for nothing. In this article, <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ferrar-890928"" target=""_blank"">Jonathan Ferrar</a> highlights a <a href=""http://futurehrtrends.eiu.com/report-2016/executive-summary/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">study by SHRM</a> that reveals this is a skill lacking in many HR analytics efforts. He then recounts an excellent example of powerful storytelling from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/smarkberry"" target=""_blank"">Mark Berry</a>. Jonathan is co-writing a book - 'The Power of People' (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">pre-order here</a>) on people analytics, which is due to be published in May 2017 and will feature a whole chapter on storytelling from where <em><strong>Figure 5</strong></em> below is extracted. Can’t wait. Also on storytelling, the short video thereafter features <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/prasad-setty-67a4b5"" target=""_blank"">Prasad Setty</a>, who leads Google’s fabled people analytics team. In it, Prasad distils effective communication into three key points that matter: what you want your audience to know, how you want them to feel, and what you want them to do. The basis for better storytelling in analytics starts here.</p>, <p><em>Figure 5: Three Principles of Storytelling (Source: The Power of People by Nigel Guenole, Sheri Feinzig &amp; Jonathan Ferrar)</em></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The importance of storytelling also features prominently in <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/patrickcoolen"" target=""_blank"">Patrick Coolen</a>‘s update of his much-loved 10 Golden Rules of HR Analytics. The result is the best version yet as not only has Patrick used crowdsourcing for the update, but has also taken the time to highlight examples of the research he and his team have conducted at ABN AMRO. My favourite rule? That has to be a tie between #2 ‘Only do business relevant research’ and #3 ‘Create actionable insights’. Read more on the people analytics journey at ABN AMRO in my interview with Patrick <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-interviews-4-patrick-coolen-abn-amro-david-green?trk=mp-author-card"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The world’s premier analyst on all things HR gave his observations on the field of people analytics at the midpoint of 2016. The headline finding is that “<em>our research shows tremendous growth in this market, and a significant shift away from measuring HR toward a real focus on using people data to understand and predict business performance</em>”. Josh then outlines ten elements driving this growth. This is a great analysis of many of the factors I am also seeing in this space. The second article from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/madhura-chakrabarti-phd-42b17022"" target=""_blank"">Madhura Chakrabarti</a>, Bersin’s People Analytics Research Leader, highlights three emerging trends: i) the need for people analytics to add value to the business; ii) analytics as the new normal for HR; and iii) the critical role of technology.

This excellent article (including <em><strong>Figure 7</strong></em> below) by <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/mortenkampandersen"" target=""_blank""><em>Morten Kamp Andersen</em></a>, not only outlines the six key skill areas Morten believes are required but also examines what happens when just one of those skills is missing. The second article is a wonderfully detailed white paper of a project Morten undertook with ISS to investigate whether and to what extent customer profitability is driven by customer experience and employee engagement.</p>, <p><em>Figure 7 - The six must-have competencies of a world-class people analytics team (Source: Morten Kamp Andersen)</em></p>, <p>As founder of the <a href=""http://www.talentstrategyinstitute.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talent Strategy Institute</a> and convenor of the <a href=""http://pafow.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics &amp; Future of Work Conference</a>, (which, I am honoured to be co-hosting with Al on 2-3 Feb in San Francisco), <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/aladamsen"" target=""_blank"">Al Adamsen</a> is one of the most popular and knowledgeable people in the field of people analytics.

Ticking both the quantity and quality boxes, there is a wealth of excellent proprietary and third party content to choose from. Choosing just one article was difficult, but I’ve plumped for this excellent piece by <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/erikvnvulpen"" target=""_blank"">Erik van Vulpen</a> on five reasons why HR Analytics projects fail. It’s an invaluable guide for anyone working in a people analytics role, especially those just getting started – as is the recent book (in which a version of the article also appears) (<a href=""http://www.analyticsinhr.com/ebook-basic-principles-people-analytics/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><em>The basic principles of People Analytics</em></a>) Erik and <a href=""http://nl.linkedin.com/in/nandosteenhuis"" target=""_blank"">Nando Steenhuis</a> have published. I was so impressed that I happily agreed to write the Foreword.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Failure, or more pertinently how to avoid it, is also the subject of this fabulous article by <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/maxblumberg"" target=""_blank"">Max Blumberg</a>, one of the leading consultants and influencers in the field. The article is designed to help budding aspirants harness people analytics, and avoid project failure, by presenting a systematic, cost-effective methodology for creating robust data sets that correlate. It’s an eminently readable resource full of great advice and tips to avoid the many pitfalls that can befall even the pluckiest of novices. See Max speak at <a href=""http://tucana-global.com/people-analytics-world-2017/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Analytics World</a> in London on 25-26 April.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>The glacial pace of progress in people analytics is perhaps not surprising since HR is trying to remake itself in an entirely new image, in an environment where supply of new analytical talent—and budget to hire them—is extremely limited. This article by <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/evansinar"" target=""_blank"">Evan Sinar</a> (also a <a href=""http://twitter.com/EvanSinar"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">must-follow on Twitter</a>) and <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/richwellins"" target=""_blank"">Rich Wellins</a> describes the skills and traits HR needs, how well (or not) the function is prepared (see <em><strong>Figure 9</strong></em> below, which had over 30,000 views when I shared it on LinkedIn before Christmas!) and the relationships in the business that can best help propel HR forward.</p>, <p><em>Figure 9: What HR needs to thrive with Analytics (Source: DDI)</em></p>, <p>One of the more impressive stories I’ve heard on building organisational capability in people analytics comes from <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmilnor"" target=""_blank"">RJ Milnor</a> and his team at Chevron. This detailed Bersin by Deloitte Case Study* comes in two parts. Part 1 describes how Chevron tackled its challenge to scale, unify and grow analytics capabilities across the organisation, making it an essential skill for all HR professionals and ultimately turn people analytics into a competitive advantage. The key focus was the business rather than HR and steps to achieve this included i) implementing a vision and mission statement to help create an identity, ii) consistently reviewing the metrics tracked for business relevance, and iii) creating a prioritisation mechanism for all analytics projects (see <em><strong>Figure 10</strong></em> below). Building organisational capability centred on two main strategies: i) launching a Community of Practice, which now has 300 members spread across 22 business units and 18 countries, and; ii) introducing a three-stage in-house analytics curriculum that serves to create a structured learning and development program in analytics. Part 2 of the Case Study describes two additional areas of Chevron’s analytics journey: how it built a centre of excellence to optimise its organisational structure and why it believes in leveraging analytics talent across functions. This multi-pronged approach has helped create a vast and virtual people analytics team and effectively changed the way HR and the business thinks. With this firm foundation in place, Chevron is well-positioned to derive the competitive advantage it seeks from its investment in people analytics.

In the first article above from the <a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">MIT Sloan Management Review</a>, the authors describe four lessons from customer analytics than can easily be applied to people analytics. The second article looks specifically at sentiment analysis, which has long been used by organisations to better understand its customers, and is now increasingly being used by forward-thinking organisations to get invaluable insights on their employees. Two examples from Twitter and IBM are highlighted. In the latter, the article describes how IBM used an internally developed sentiment-analysis tool called Social Pulse to engage its employees in a revamp of its performance-review system.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>If people analytics is to become a core component of the future HR then it is important that everyone working within the function has a reasonable level of analytical understanding and curiosity. This excellent white paper by Nigel Guenole and Sheri Feinzig, adapted from ‘The Power of People’ book (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Power-People-Successful-Organizations-Performance/dp/0134546008"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">pre-order here</a>) they have written together with Jonathan Ferrar, simplifies the potentially complex subject of research designs and different analytical methods. Confidence (or more to the point, the lack of it) is one of the inhibitors holding many HR professional back from embracing analytics – resources like this white paper are exactly what is needed to accelerate progress. </p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As <a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/oliver-britnell-9550232"" target=""_blank"">Olly Britnell</a>, Head of Global Workforce Analytics at Experian, testifies in this article, many organisations are still swimming in the slow lane when it comes to workforce analytics. As he goes on to state, it doesn’t have to be a struggle, and this is less likely to be the case if organisations and nascent analytics leaders follow the excellent advice in this article. Effective stakeholder management, building a balanced team and prioritising education and awareness are just three of the tips provided.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Whilst this white paper provides a stark analysis on the current state of people analytics it does provide HR with some helpful home truths, which if the function doesn’t address may lead to many organisations situating people analytics outside HR. The three primary areas of deficiency highlighted by the study are i) most organisations are still only doing basic analyses (see <em><strong>Figure 11</strong></em> below), ii) poor data quality, and, therefore perhaps not unsurprisingly; iii) a lack of confidence by the business in these fledgling people analytics functions. Indeed, more companies said their people analytics team hinders their analytics work than helps it. The silver lining is that these challenges can be tackled and the report goes on to elucidate some of the practical steps that organisations can take to do just that.                                         </p>, <p><em>Figure 11 - The type of people analytics projects being undertaken today (Source: New Talent Management Network)</em></p>, <p>Many organisations decide to build a Centre of Excellence (CoE) as part of its attempt to develop people analytics capability. In this piece, <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/manojkumarhranalytics"" target=""_blank"">Manoj Kumar</a>, who led HSBC’s HR Analytics CoE for five years, outlines five reasons why a CoE may not deliver ROI within expected timelines whilst also suggesting fixes to each of these challenges. I can also highly recommend Manoj’s <a href=""http://talkinghranalytics.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Talking HR Analytics</a> blog as an excellent resource for those working or interested in the field.</p>, <p><em>Figure 12: A HR Analytics CoE requires that change is driven by all the stakeholders (Manoj Kumar)</em></p>, <p>Being a mathematician, prolific writer and consultant <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/numericalinsights"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Smith</a> tables 13 (it’s a prime!) ideas for the budding people analytics aspirant to get started. Together, these cover the whole gamut of people operations from recruiting through to engagement, performance and retention – all with the emphasis on providing business value. There is plenty to inspire here.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>As founder and CEO of Talent Analytics, <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/greta-roberts-b0217"" target=""_blank"">Greta Roberts</a> has been helping organisations do analytics with their people data for 15 years. Therefore, it is no surprise that she offers some great advice in this article on how to implement predictive workforce analytics and the common pitfalls to avoid. I particularly like Greta’s advice on avoiding the “Wikipedia approach” of starting with the dataset rather than the business question – a typical problem I encounter with organisations trying to get started in this space.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>How do you engage HRBPs and make them “consumers of analytics”? This was the weighty challenge set for the first Human Capital Analytics Group Hackathon held by Copenhagen Business School under the auspices of <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/dana-minbaeva-2818a35"" target=""_blank"">Professor Dana Minbaeva</a>. The solutions are nicely summarised in this article by <a href=""http://dk.linkedin.com/in/saskia-menke-788b9ba0/en"" target=""_blank"">Saskia Menke</a>. It is certainly an important challenge for organisations if they are to scale analytics and create a sustainable capability across HR, so the findings make for interesting reading.<strong> </strong></p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobmorgan8"" target=""_blank"">Jacob Morgan</a>’s Future of Work podcast is always worth a listen and this is certainly the case when it comes to this episode featuring <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminwaber"" target=""_blank"">Ben Waber</a>, CEO of <a href=""http://www.humanyze.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Humanyze</a>, a social sensing and analytics platform that uses sensors in employee ID badges to drive team effectiveness and engagement. Waber offers some fascinating observations on the people analytics space, not least his observations to i) start small, but do something that makes you uncomfortable and outside of your comfort zone, ii) if you don’t start people analytics in the next two years it will be hard to catch up with those that have, and iii) on average people analytics increases top line performance by 10-15%.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p>Another practitioner article comes from <a href=""http://in.linkedin.com/in/sidshishoo"" target=""_blank"">Sidhartha Shishoo</a> of Genpact on the excellent <a href=""http://www.peoplematters.in/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">People Matters</a> site. The article describes some of the challenges Genpact faced when embarking on its people analytics journey including i) separating analytics from reporting, ii) data quality, iii) building capability and iv) employee privacy. It’s an outstanding article and one that emphasises the need for boldness: in thinking, in strategy and in application when it comes to people analytics.</p>, <p><br/></p>, <p><a href=""http://uk.linkedin.com/in/samuelhill68"" target=""_blank"">Sam Hill</a> trains HR practitioners through his ‘Practical People Analytics’ course (and very good it is too, by all accounts). This article describes some of the lessons this experience has taught him such as the need to i) differentiate between reporting and analytics, ii) embrace rather than eschew traditional HR intuition and iii) collaborate and share.
